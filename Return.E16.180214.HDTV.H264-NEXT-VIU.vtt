1
00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:09.093
Run a test on this as fast as you can.

2
00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:12.464
See if the DNA of this hair and the DNA of Yum Mi Jung match.

3
00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:13.804
Where did you get this?

4
00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:16.433
I don't have time to explain every little detail.

5
00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:18.503
Hey, Won.

6
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.973
We have a copy of the penthouse's surveillance footage, right?

7
00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:23.343
Yes. What about it?

8
00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:27.383
Well... Can you check the parts where Kim Jung Soo shows up again?

9
00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:28.584
See if there's something unusual.

10
00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.183
Okay. You got it.

11
00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:31.554
Okay.

12
00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:35.953
Take care of it. Don't make me get annoyed.

13
00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:37.754
- Hurry! - Yes, sir.

14
00:00:42.264 --> 00:00:43.264
Joon Hee.

15
00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:45.664
Joon.

16
00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:47.633
We're here.

17
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.573
Joon Hee.

18
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.603
Joon Hee.

19
00:00:58.614 --> 00:00:59.614
Hey.

20
00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:03.014
This punk really is sick.

21
00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:07.983
But it's nice seeing him again,

22
00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:09.883
even if he is like this.

23
00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:13.523
Kim Jung Soo was Joon Hee's attending doctor.

24
00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.463
That small-minded jerk.

25
00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:18.594
It was 10 years ago.

26
00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:20.304
Why is he going this far?

27
00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:22.704
I won't forgive...

28
00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.403
that jerk.

29
00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:25.603
What will you do then?

30
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.844
Look at the mess we're in because of that jerk.

31
00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:30.543
Punks from the school...

32
00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:32.144
complain that I got my job...

33
00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:35.784
due to my family connections.

34
00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:39.954
I'm too embarrassed to work in the school,

35
00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:42.784
my school,

36
00:01:44.153 --> 00:01:45.793
which my grandfather built,

37
00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:48.993
anymore.

38
00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:51.463
Do as you wish on that.

39
00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:53.664
Just watch what you say to the detective...

40
00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.463
investigating Byung Gi's case.

41
00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:56.704
Whatever.

42
00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.633
Even I can't trust...

43
00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:00.674
my mouth anymore.

44
00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:02.444
If Kim Jung Soo is the real killer,

45
00:02:03.243 --> 00:02:04.373
that means he knows...

46
00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:06.743
everything we did.

47
00:02:06.883 --> 00:02:08.244
How much...

48
00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:10.814
does that doctor jerk know?

49
00:02:10.853 --> 00:02:13.483
I want to grab him by the collar and ask too.

50
00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:19.964
Seeing him like this...

51
00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:23.263
breaks my heart,

52
00:02:24.763 --> 00:02:26.363
but if he wakes up,

53
00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:31.603
it'll be a headache.

54
00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.504
Hey. What are you doing here?

55
00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:03.133
What are you doing without me?

56
00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.733
We figured you wouldn't feel up to going around in public,

57
00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:07.004
so we came by ourselves.

58
00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:11.043
Gosh.

59
00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:22.754
In Ho.

60
00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:25.224
Joon Hee will be fine.

61
00:03:26.323 --> 00:03:27.964
- Okay? - Sure.

62
00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:33.534
That's right.

63
00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:38.474
At least the color in his cheeks got much better.

64
00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:42.904
Okay. Gosh. This brat...

65
00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:53.853
Anyway,

66
00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:57.654
why do you think he ended up like that?

67
00:03:58.353 --> 00:03:59.853
- Gosh. - Hey.

68
00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:01.863
Do you really know nothing?

69
00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:07.664
I find it so strange that he didn't tell you...

70
00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:11.333
if he knew something so huge.

71
00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:15.444
He did tell us.

72
00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:18.243
He said he wanted to help you,

73
00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:21.243
but there was nothing he could do,

74
00:04:23.553 --> 00:04:24.584
and that he was miserable.

75
00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:30.094
That aside,

76
00:04:30.524 --> 00:04:32.753
who could've taken out my bag...

77
00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:35.094
from the penthouse and how?

78
00:04:35.664 --> 00:04:38.134
Only the four of us have access to the penthouse.

79
00:04:39.063 --> 00:04:40.063
What?

80
00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:43.904
Are you saying we did it?

81
00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:46.673
Hey. That's utterly absurd.

82
00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:49.274
I'm just saying it's weird.

83
00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:50.414
It's five,

84
00:04:52.373 --> 00:04:53.414
including Mi Jung.

85
00:04:56.753 --> 00:04:57.983
According to the trial,

86
00:04:57.983 --> 00:05:00.584
that doctor from Daemyung hospital, who lives downstairs,

87
00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:02.584
was the last person to speak with Mi Jung.

88
00:05:02.584 --> 00:05:05.053
That doctor framed it on all of us...

89
00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:06.053
"Us"?

90
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:11.394
What?

91
00:05:12.164 --> 00:05:13.193
Us.

92
00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:16.563
Aren't we like brothers?

93
00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:19.904
Was I the only one who thought that?

94
00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:23.714
You are me, and I am you.

95
00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:26.014
Forget it.

96
00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:30.113
Anyway,

97
00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:32.553
are things okay with Na Ra?

98
00:05:43.164 --> 00:05:46.063
(Surgeon Kim Jung Soo)

99
00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:01.644
(No mistakes. Situation handled. I'm going to the police.)

(Pawn Shop)

101
00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:09.084
(Pawn Shop)

102
00:06:09.154 --> 00:06:10.154
Here it is.

103
00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:29.543
- Did you find anything? - I'm checking carefully,

104
00:06:30.144 --> 00:06:31.813
but there is one clip that gave me the chills.

105
00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:33.074
Let me watch.

106
00:06:34.113 --> 00:06:35.144
Here.

107
00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:45.053
Why does this give you chills?

108
00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:48.464
This was taken at 3am on the day before Yum Mi Jung's body...

109
00:06:48.693 --> 00:06:50.464
was found on the road in Paju.

110
00:06:52.363 --> 00:06:56.774
At 3am, he left with a case large enough to fit a person.

111
00:06:57.704 --> 00:06:58.834
It gives me the chills.

112
00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:08.084
The test results are out. Call me.

113
00:07:19.964 --> 00:07:21.993
What about the DNA test on the hair sample?

114
00:07:22.623 --> 00:07:23.634
Well...

115
00:07:33.134 --> 00:07:34.974
Okay. Thank you.

116
00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:36.873
How is the result?

117
00:07:39.644 --> 00:07:40.644
The result?

118
00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:44.414
Young.

119
00:07:44.884 --> 00:07:46.053
He came to turn himself in.

120
00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:49.024
Who did?

121
00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:10.113
You'll turn yourself in?

122
00:08:12.313 --> 00:08:13.313
Yes.

123
00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:16.784
I came to turn myself in for Yum Mi Jung's murderer.

124
00:08:18.613 --> 00:08:20.623
What about the DNA test on the hair sample?

125
00:08:20.853 --> 00:08:21.853
Well...

126
00:08:23.853 --> 00:08:26.324
it doesn't match Yum Mi Jung's DNA.

127
00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:28.164
It's a completely different person.

128
00:08:29.964 --> 00:08:33.093
- Are you sure? - Science can't lie.

129
00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:36.404
I'll ask again, Kim Jung Soo.

130
00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:41.404
Did you really kill Yum Mi Jung?

131
00:08:43.043 --> 00:08:44.043
Yes,

132
00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:47.484
I killed her.

133
00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:06.904
I looked into Kim Soo Hyun as you had asked.

134
00:09:09.303 --> 00:09:10.333
How is she doing?

135
00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:14.374
Well, she's in a mental hospital.

136
00:09:17.774 --> 00:09:20.583
(Hope Psychiatric Hospital)

137
00:09:25.914 --> 00:09:31.354
(Isolated Ward, Ward 3)

138
00:09:51.443 --> 00:09:53.043
She hurts others and herself,

139
00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:56.043
so we had no choice but to put her in a straight jacket.

140
00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:59.583
She gets angry like that whenever she sees a shadow.

141
00:10:00.854 --> 00:10:02.553
Then please excuse me.

142
00:10:08.624 --> 00:10:10.664
Soo Hyun, stop it. Soo Hyun.

143
00:10:11.034 --> 00:10:13.463
It's okay. Your brother is here. It's okay.

144
00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:18.534
It's okay.

145
00:10:20.043 --> 00:10:22.343
Okay, okay. That's a good girl.

146
00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:29.614
Your brother's here. It's okay.

147
00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:31.114
Soo Hyun.

Miss.

150
00:11:14.723 --> 00:11:16.193
Where's Dal Rae?

151
00:11:17.534 --> 00:11:18.634
You're home.

152
00:11:20.634 --> 00:11:22.933
I sent Dal Rae and the helper out for a moment.

153
00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:25.534
- Why? - Nothing much.

154
00:11:26.404 --> 00:11:29.343
Right. I think we should hire someone new for the position.

155
00:11:29.343 --> 00:11:31.014
The house isn't the same as it was before.

156
00:11:32.644 --> 00:11:34.683
It can't be the same.

157
00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:39.453
And don't treat firing someone that lightly.

158
00:11:40.254 --> 00:11:42.154
She depends on this job for her income.

159
00:11:44.793 --> 00:11:47.563
I'm sorry. I didn't think it through.

160
00:11:48.593 --> 00:11:51.134
Why don't you go wash up first?

161
00:11:51.134 --> 00:11:53.333
I'm cooking pasta. Let's have some wine with it.

162
00:11:53.833 --> 00:11:55.504
- I'm tired. - Please!

163
00:11:58.433 --> 00:12:00.374
Na Ra, could you please stop this?

164
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:04.043
It was... It was all my fault.

165
00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:07.644
So please forgive me. Let it go for Dal Rae's sake.

166
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.043
How could I?

167
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.284
I can't forget what you had done.

168
00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:14.524
Honey, about Mi Jung...

169
00:12:14.524 --> 00:12:18.394
What have you guys done to that poor little girl?

170
00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:20.994
I'm not following you.

00:12:24.463 --> 00:12:26.093
Honey.

173
00:12:27.004 --> 00:12:28.463
I was young at that time too.

174
00:12:29.134 --> 00:12:31.803
It doesn't matter. There are things you must still not do.

175
00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:33.843
You shouldn't have done that!

176
00:12:34.144 --> 00:12:35.543
Why did you do that?

177
00:12:36.244 --> 00:12:38.014
You shouldn't have done that.

178
00:12:38.343 --> 00:12:39.874
Why did you?

179
00:12:40.514 --> 00:12:42.343
Why?

180
00:12:46.624 --> 00:12:48.484
Why did you do that?

181

182
00:13:10.144 --> 00:13:12.244
Don't talk to me. I've got nothing to say to you.

183
00:13:12.774 --> 00:13:16.083
I'll do the talking. I ask that you only listen to what I have to say.

184
00:13:16.343 --> 00:13:17.614
I don't want to.

185
00:13:19.313 --> 00:13:20.784
I was a good enough husband...

186
00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:23.423
these past years for you...

187
00:13:23.793 --> 00:13:26.323
to hear my excuse at least once.

188
00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:29.193
I was...

189
00:13:29.524 --> 00:13:32.864
at least good to you and Dal Rae, wasn't I?

190
00:13:35.563 --> 00:13:38.703
I wanted to be a good man at least to you.

191
00:13:38.703 --> 00:13:43.104
Yes, you can think of my kindness as my attempt to stay as a good man,

192
00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:48.244
but I... I wasn't such a good man...

193
00:13:49.543 --> 00:13:51.213
you thought I was.

194
00:13:53.654 --> 00:13:55.284
I was always anxious about it.

195
00:13:56.453 --> 00:13:57.553
I was afraid...

196
00:13:58.624 --> 00:14:00.293
that one day, you'd see the worst side of me.

197
00:14:05.734 --> 00:14:07.864
That's your excuse for cheating on me.

198
00:14:08.703 --> 00:14:09.833
At first,

199
00:14:11.734 --> 00:14:14.904
I had an affair with her because it was comfortable and familiar.

200
00:14:15.644 --> 00:14:16.774
But at one point,

201
00:14:17.374 --> 00:14:21.384
I sank into the swamp of this affair and I couldn't escape from it.

202
00:14:22.484 --> 00:14:25.553
Hearing about it disgusts me. Please get out. Will you?

203
00:14:43.303 --> 00:14:44.833
I'm sorry to have disappointed you.

204
00:15:06.624 --> 00:15:10.764
Do you know that you haven't said a word for seven hours?

205
00:15:14.864 --> 00:15:17.374
If you came here to confess,

206
00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:20.473
you must tell me...

207
00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:23.573
when, where, why, and how you murdered the victim.

208
00:15:25.673 --> 00:15:28.884
Fine. I'll go first.

209
00:15:29.644 --> 00:15:31.713
In the tub at your house,

210
00:15:31.713 --> 00:15:34.384
I found hair that seems to be a woman's.

211
00:15:34.384 --> 00:15:38.553
However, the DNA did not match Yum Mi Jung's.

212
00:15:38.923 --> 00:15:41.364
And the night before her body was discovered,

213
00:15:41.593 --> 00:15:44.364
I saw you moving something that looked like...

214
00:15:44.364 --> 00:15:45.994
Yum Mi Jung's body in the surveillance footage.

215
00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:48.764
Contrabass.

216
00:15:50.703 --> 00:15:51.933
But when I looked into that...

217
00:15:52.604 --> 00:15:56.573
On that day, our orchestra had a concert in Namhae at 10am.

218
00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:58.874
Most of us arrived there the day before the concert.

219
00:15:59.244 --> 00:16:01.514
But I heard that you arrived there...

220
00:16:01.514 --> 00:16:03.854
during the night because of work at the hospital.

221
00:16:05.514 --> 00:16:07.223
You confessed to the act,

222
00:16:07.553 --> 00:16:09.553
but the suspicions I had about you...

223
00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:10.553
just became useless...

224
00:16:10.894 --> 00:16:13.264
as evidence to prove that you committed the crime.

225
00:16:16.264 --> 00:16:17.963
What's your play here?

226
00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:20.203
Why did you turn yourself in?

227
00:16:29.973 --> 00:16:32.313
My gosh, it's freezing.

228
00:16:32.313 --> 00:16:33.384
It is indeed.

229
00:16:37.884 --> 00:16:40.154
- Did you find anything? - No such luck.

230
00:16:40.683 --> 00:16:42.284
- What about you? - Same here.

231
00:16:45.053 --> 00:16:47.223
- What is that key? - What's that?

232
00:16:48.093 --> 00:16:49.193
What do you think it is?

233
00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:51.833
Where did you get it?

234
00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:53.664
Kim Jung Soo hid it in his house.

235
00:16:54.234 --> 00:16:56.303
- Is that so? - I have the key,

236
00:16:57.004 --> 00:16:58.504
but nothing in his house fits.

237
00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:00.744
I even sent the photo of it to every subway station...

238
00:17:00.744 --> 00:17:03.203
in the country to see if this is a key for the subway lockers.

239
00:17:04.044 --> 00:17:06.983
- They don't use a key like that. - Could it be it's nothing?

240
00:17:10.483 --> 00:17:13.483
But is this an "H" on this key...

241
00:17:13.683 --> 00:17:15.324
or an "I"?

242
00:17:15.483 --> 00:17:18.394
Dummy. It's an "H", of course.

243
00:17:18.824 --> 00:17:21.693
- Say, "H". - Sure. "H".

244
00:17:21.923 --> 00:17:24.193
It's "H".

245
00:17:24.263 --> 00:17:25.733
Is my pronunciation that bad?

246
00:17:26.263 --> 00:17:27.664
Do you volunteer too?

(Holt Charity Concert for Children Welfare)

248
00:17:28.963 --> 00:17:30.433
It's nothing much.

249
00:17:30.673 --> 00:17:32.904
Some people got together to donate our talent.

250
00:17:38.814 --> 00:17:39.844

It's where we keep stuff we don't use.

254
00:17:55.463 --> 00:17:56.794
It was only a little while ago.

255
00:17:56.794 --> 00:17:59.493
Jung Soo said he needed to store something.

256
00:17:59.894 --> 00:18:01.104
"A little while ago"?

257
00:18:01.263 --> 00:18:03.604
That key is for the cabinet over there.

258
00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:07.874
Okay. Let me check it by myself first.

259
00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:09.144
Sure. Go ahead.

260

Come in. This is the lounge.

Is that the locker Kim Byung Gi used?

Yes, that's the one.

266
00:18:45.443 --> 00:18:49.483
But are you sure that Byung Gi had disappeared?

267
00:18:49.614 --> 00:18:51.453
We must investigate to confirm that.

268
00:18:51.453 --> 00:18:52.814
I see.

00:18:59.753 --> 00:19:01.763

Before Kim Byung Gi had gone missing,

272
00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:15.904
did you notice anything unusual about him?

No, I don't remember anything like that.

What is it? Is your investigation not going your way?

283
00:20:07.763 --> 00:20:09.894
Why did you hide something like that?

284
00:20:10.064 --> 00:20:11.134
Why did you hide that?

Why are you ordering me to find some USB drive?

326
00:23:16.344 --> 00:23:19.013
It's about my friend as well.

327
00:23:20.223 --> 00:23:21.783
Not long ago,

328
00:23:22.824 --> 00:23:24.594
my friend went missing.

329
00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:26.154
I'm sorry about that.

330
00:23:26.963 --> 00:23:27.963
And?

331
00:23:28.164 --> 00:23:29.164
I think...

332
00:23:32.864 --> 00:23:34.263
it was because of this.

333
00:23:38.503 --> 00:23:41.943
Shouldn't you go to the police to discuss a missing person?

334
00:23:41.943 --> 00:23:43.374
If that was the right move,

335
00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:46.743
my friend would've gone to the cops first.

336
00:23:47.644 --> 00:23:49.314
So why did you come to me?

337

There is a video...

338
00:23:51.614 --> 00:23:52.914
of your friends...

339
00:23:53.584 --> 00:23:56.423
that is related to your trial.

340
00:23:59.854 --> 00:24:01.594
May I take a look?

341
00:24:08.564 --> 00:24:09.703
Give me 500,000 dollars.

342
00:24:12.233 --> 00:24:14.604
- You came to the wrong place. - 100,000 dollars.

343
00:24:15.743 --> 00:24:16.773
100,000 dollars.

344
00:24:18.443 --> 00:24:19.914
I can't go any lower.

345
00:24:21.713 --> 00:24:26.624
Look. I'm not interested enough to make such a deal.

346
00:24:26.723 --> 00:24:28.723
My trial ended well too.

347
00:24:29.423 --> 00:24:30.493
Even though this...

348
00:24:31.693 --> 00:24:34.394
has the real killer caught on camera?

349
00:25:44.733 --> 00:25:46.094
One, two, three.

350
00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:52.033
What is this?

351
00:26:47.594 --> 00:26:49.294
Four bottles of rocuronium went missing.

352
00:26:49.664 --> 00:26:51.164
One of the four bottles of rocuronium...

353
00:26:51.164 --> 00:26:52.864
must've been used to kill Yum Mi Jung.

354
00:26:53.533 --> 00:26:55.304
Where are the remaining three?

355
00:26:55.763 --> 00:26:58.904
That's what you must do now. Find them.

356
00:27:25.564 --> 00:27:27.233
(Return)

357
00:27:27.703 --> 00:27:28.703
How many hours do we have left?

358
00:27:28.703 --> 00:27:29.834
28 hours.

359
00:27:29.834 --> 00:27:31.604
Kim Soo Hyun's trial record. It's from Choi Jae Hye.

360
00:27:31.604 --> 00:27:33.574
Choi Jae Hye was there?

361
00:27:33.574 --> 00:27:36.243
It's been a while, Bum. Let's meet up.

362
00:27:36.243 --> 00:27:38.074
You little rat.

363
00:27:38.074 --> 00:27:40.314
Why did the people involved in that case 10 years ago gather?

364
00:27:40.314 --> 00:27:42.314
- Why? - What are you doing?

365
00:27:42.544 --> 00:27:44.654
I'll go where I must go.

366
00:27:44.654 --> 00:27:47.683
I'm Dokgo Young. 919-114.

367
00:27:47.683 --> 00:27:49.624
What have you guys done?
