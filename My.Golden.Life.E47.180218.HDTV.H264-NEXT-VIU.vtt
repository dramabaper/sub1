3
00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:08.327
(Haesung Corporation's daughter was found...)

4
00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:09.358
(after 25 years, but she was a fake.)

5
00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:22.607
(Episode 47)

6
00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:26.366
Seo lied and sent his real child as Choi Eun Seok...

7
00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:28.936
and committed a fraud...

8
00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:32.266
How could they write such an article?

9
00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:37.307
What's wrong with them?

10
00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:39.406
Why are there articles about this?

11
00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:42.476
Mom.

12
00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:49.957
Daebang-dong.

13
00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:52.126
They even included the name of our town.

14
00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:54.597
Ji An. What do we do now?

15
00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:21.816
I beg you.

16
00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:24.857
Stop my children...

17
00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:28.796
from becoming a criminal's children.

18
00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:32.326
There will be no compromise.

19
00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:36.167
Mr. No.

20
00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:38.507
Please...

21
00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:40.607
prevent the public from knowing...

22
00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:45.206
that I'm the father of Ji Tae, Ji Ho, and Ji An.

23
00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:50.147
But you'll receive money.

24
00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:53.217
People will lower their heads before money.

25
00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.326
I'm here.

26
00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:04.897
You...

27
00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:09.696
Get up.

28
00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.936
What are you doing?

29
00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.807
There's no use. Get up.

30
00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:21.747
I'm sorry I'm late.

31
00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:24.587
I'm glad you're well.

32
00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:26.886
I'll handle this.

33
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.156
I heard you on my way here.

34
00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:32.686
I'll handle it,

35
00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.057
so you can relax.

36
00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:37.726
Since we're in a rush,

37
00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:41.136
I'll talk to Seo Tae Soo and let you know.

38
00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:43.737
Let's go.

39
00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:49.376
I knew it.

40
00:02:50.147 --> 00:02:52.647
You can never give up the vice chairman position.

41
00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:54.517
Mountain climbing?

42
00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:58.147
Why would you go up if you'll come down again?

43
00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:10.997
Vice Chairman Choi.

44
00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.566
What do you want me to do?

45
00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:18.767
You said you heard everything.

46
00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:22.277
I can't hold a press conference.

47
00:03:22.277 --> 00:03:24.307
- My children... - It's out already.

48
00:03:25.846 --> 00:03:28.017
Someone already exposed...

49
00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:29.677
that our daughters were switched.

50
00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:32.017
What?

51
00:03:32.017 --> 00:03:33.117
(Haesung Corporation's daughter was found...)

52
00:03:33.117 --> 00:03:34.186
(after 25 years, but she was a fake.)

53
00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:37.786
What? Who... Who would...

54
00:03:39.027 --> 00:03:41.927
My Ji An. My Ji Soo.

55
00:03:42.797 --> 00:03:45.897
Vice Chairman Choi. Ji An didn't do anything.

56
00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:47.497
Neither did Ji Soo.

57
00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:50.337
I know. I'm well aware.

58
00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:53.777
As Mr. No said,

59
00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:56.406
I'll take the blame.

60
00:03:57.147 --> 00:04:01.247
Is there a way to bring this article down?

61
00:04:02.177 --> 00:04:04.047
If people find out I switched the daughter,

62
00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:06.916
Ji An can't survive. She can't.

63
00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:08.856
I can't...

64
00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:11.626
let her face humiliation due to my fault.

65
00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:19.726
What...

66
00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:23.197
should I do?

67
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:26.007
Like I said before,

68
00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:28.437
I won't let you do as Mr. No said.

69
00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.707
I'll find a way.

70
00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:34.317
Wait for me at home.

71
00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:36.217
Actually,

72
00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:39.246
I think Ji An and Ji Soo should hide for some time.

73
00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:41.856
I'll find a place and call you.

74
00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:43.556
Bye now.

75
00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:53.337
Vice Chairman Choi.

76
00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:57.567
The vice chairman will set a date...

77
00:04:57.606 --> 00:05:00.337
for Seo Tae Soo's press conference like you said.

78
00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.577
He learned a lesson after wandering around.

79
00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:09.846
But how did they write the article about...

80
00:05:09.986 --> 00:05:11.116
Eun Seok being switched?

81
00:05:11.116 --> 00:05:12.116
I know.

82
00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:15.217
There must be a reporter...

83
00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:17.257
considering the photos.

84
00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:20.226
Was it you?

85
00:05:20.226 --> 00:05:21.726
Why would I?

86
00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:24.467
That wouldn't give any damage to No Myung Hee.

87
00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:25.467
She's only a victim.

88
00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:28.166
It's a shame on Seo Tae Soo's family.

89
00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:32.637
But why isn't Myung Hee making a move?

90
00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:33.837
I'm not sure.

91
00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:37.476
She's always been Father's favorite.

92
00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:39.077
I can't guess anything.

93
00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.877
I thought she'd run here about now...

94
00:05:41.877 --> 00:05:44.087
to pull my hair or something like that.

95
00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:58.127
Dad.

96
00:06:02.137 --> 00:06:03.866
Did you go hiking?

97
00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.837
I'm sorry to have worried you.

98
00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:07.906
Where were you?

99
00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:11.077
I met with a reporter and asked for a favor too.

100
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.746
The tabloid and those three articles...

101
00:06:13.877 --> 00:06:15.817
were all printed today.

102
00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:17.416
But the sources are all different.

103
00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:19.346
And the articles are from different agencies too.

104
00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.317
You were appointed to be the president.

105
00:06:21.457 --> 00:06:23.187
Why did you accept it? What about the factory?

106
00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:26.697
I handed it over to Secretary Yoo.

107
00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:32.267
I guess you belong to the Haesung family too.

108
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.366
Since you accepted the position,

109
00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:36.596
you won't be able to leave the company again.

110
00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:37.866
Grandfather...

111
00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:40.377
collapsed because of me.

112
00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:43.647
I couldn't cause Haesung falter.

113
00:06:44.846 --> 00:06:47.947
Why did you resign, Dad?

114
00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:50.846
Let's talk later since we have a pressing matter.

115
00:06:50.846 --> 00:06:52.647
Since he didn't accept my resignation yet,

116
00:06:52.647 --> 00:06:55.217
I am still the vice chairman for now.

117
00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.426
You told me the other day...

118
00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:01.726
that I won't be able to make Ji An happy...

119
00:07:02.457 --> 00:07:04.327
and you weren't happy with the Haesung family.

120
00:07:05.897 --> 00:07:07.166
Among causes of your unhappiness,

121
00:07:07.697 --> 00:07:10.937
is Eun Seok's disappearance one of them?

122
00:07:11.236 --> 00:07:12.767
Are you referring to the article in question?

123
00:07:14.937 --> 00:07:16.676
That article isn't completely groundless.

124
00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:20.217
So the article from 25 years ago...

125
00:07:21.277 --> 00:07:22.416
is true?

126
00:07:28.257 --> 00:07:30.827
I feel much better after telling you the story,

127
00:07:30.827 --> 00:07:32.627
but you seem bothered by it.

128
00:07:36.127 --> 00:07:37.166
You and Mom...

129
00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:41.166
had a problem from the start of your marriage.

130
00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.036
Because you got married after dating each other.

131
00:07:44.707 --> 00:07:46.806
Is it time for you to wallow in your feelings?

132
00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:49.406
You were raised in this family from the start.

133
00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:51.806
I don't think it should shock you that much.

134
00:07:54.246 --> 00:07:56.746
Anyway, we must discuss the problem...

135
00:07:57.986 --> 00:07:59.017
Please excuse me.

136
00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:04.627
News about Ms. Seo being in your family is out.

137
00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:06.056
I wanted to make sure you knew.

138
00:08:06.656 --> 00:08:07.726
Dad.

139
00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:10.697
There's another article about Ji An and Ji Soo.

140
00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:12.366
Did you not know already?

141
00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.137
(Daughter Was Discovered, But She Was a Fake)

142
00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:24.447
(Their long-lost daughter was switched with a fake.)

143
00:08:27.116 --> 00:08:28.447
Who would write this?

144
00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:46.266
Yes?

145
00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.866
There's another article. Did you read it?

146
00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:51.307
I did.

147
00:08:51.636 --> 00:08:52.967
I'm going to handle it no matter what.

148
00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:54.937
It's better to stay somewhere else until then.

149
00:08:56.776 --> 00:08:58.207
Both you and Ji Soo.

150
00:09:01.547 --> 00:09:04.146
I'll pick you up. Don't meet me at your house.

151
00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:05.746
Meet me at the church after 30 minutes.

152
00:09:06.287 --> 00:09:08.217
I can just stay here.

153
00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:10.657
I can't leave my family behind.

154
00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:13.026
The reporters might not know where I live.

155
00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:14.396
Will you listen to me, please?

156
00:09:15.557 --> 00:09:16.967
I just have a bad feeling about this.

157
00:09:17.866 --> 00:09:20.537
Okay. Nothing will happen, but you must still leave.

158
00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:22.567
Even if it's just for tonight.

159
00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:25.037
Just until I look into this.

160
00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:27.606
I'll go only after I see my dad.

161
00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:29.577
I'll call him now,

162
00:09:29.907 --> 00:09:32.776
so could you call Ji Soo? She must be really scared.

163
00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:44.126
(Do Kyung)

164
00:09:44.126 --> 00:09:46.427
(Incoming call, Dad)

165
00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:50.197
- Dad. - Hey, Ji An.

166
00:09:50.327 --> 00:09:54.837
Go to the house in Jeongseon now. Hurry.

167
00:09:54.937 --> 00:09:56.297
What about you, Dad?

168
00:09:56.297 --> 00:09:58.667
Don't worry about me. Just go now.

169
00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:14.116
Ji An might be more comfortable with us.

170
00:10:14.356 --> 00:10:15.986
She won't be comfortable around Do Kyung.

171
00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:19.356
I just want to be alone with you.

172
00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:21.697
I might not be able to see you for a few days.

173
00:10:22.297 --> 00:10:24.967
I can go see you every day, so don't...

174
00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:27.667
It's not that.

175
00:10:29.136 --> 00:10:30.907
I wanted Ji An and Do Kyung...

176
00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:33.307
to spend some time together.

177
00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:35.037
What?

178
00:10:35.037 --> 00:10:37.506
Even if they don't say a word to each other...

179
00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:39.307
or fight,

180
00:10:39.476 --> 00:10:41.346
I just wanted them to be together...

181
00:10:41.776 --> 00:10:43.746
because their feelings are mutual.

182
00:10:44.846 --> 00:10:47.116
Choi Do Kyung went back to Haesung.

183
00:10:47.317 --> 00:10:49.087
Imagine how disappointed Ji An must have been.

184
00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:51.157
Even I felt betrayed.

185
00:10:52.187 --> 00:10:54.896
Disappointment doesn't erase your feelings.

186
00:10:55.797 --> 00:10:58.866
You'd still miss and want to be with that person.

187
00:10:59.697 --> 00:11:01.697
That's not something we can control.

188
00:11:02.866 --> 00:11:06.006
Do you know how hard I tried not to like you?

189
00:11:07.736 --> 00:11:08.736
You did?

190
00:11:09.807 --> 00:11:11.276
But I couldn't.

191
00:11:12.207 --> 00:11:13.817
My heart would beat...

192
00:11:14.077 --> 00:11:16.177
regardless of my intention.

193
00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:18.616
I'm worried that she might get hurt...

194
00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:20.187
if she follows her heart.

195
00:11:20.557 --> 00:11:24.057
But I'm sure she needs Do Kyung right now.

196
00:11:25.356 --> 00:11:27.927
I don't know where I'd be without you today either.

197
00:11:28.496 --> 00:11:30.567
My photos are in the articles.

198
00:11:30.567 --> 00:11:32.197
Reporters would've visited me too.

199
00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.067
I would've wanted to die if I were alone.

200
00:12:25.917 --> 00:12:27.756
Why are you looking at me like that?

201
00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:32.026
You look different.

202
00:12:34.827 --> 00:12:37.427
This is how you were when I first met you.

203
00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:38.596
Hold your sarcasm.

204
00:12:39.427 --> 00:12:41.337
You will never understand me.

205
00:12:42.797 --> 00:12:43.907
That's not true.

206
00:12:45.136 --> 00:12:47.707
I'm sad because I understand you too well.

207
00:12:50.547 --> 00:12:51.577
Get in.

208
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:21.537
Your eyes will go bad. Why are you in the dark?

209
00:13:34.986 --> 00:13:36.187
Honey.

210
00:13:37.327 --> 00:13:38.927
You can stop beating yourself up.

211
00:13:43.427 --> 00:13:46.567
Whatever happens, we'll go through it together.

212
00:13:47.437 --> 00:13:48.736
We are family.

213
00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:56.577
Because we are family,

214
00:13:57.346 --> 00:14:01.016
we are supposed to forgive each other's mistakes.

215
00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:03.687
Your mistakes. My mistakes.

216
00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:06.486
Let's deal with them together, Mi Jung.

217
00:14:08.557 --> 00:14:09.616
Tae Soo.

218
00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:38.346
You only texted Ms. Min that you're going away.

219
00:14:39.217 --> 00:14:40.756
Did you go hiking?

220
00:14:44.386 --> 00:14:47.457
It must've been nice to enjoy the view alone.

221
00:14:49.496 --> 00:14:53.126
It was nice, but it was nothing but a short dream.

222
00:14:54.297 --> 00:14:56.636
I read the articles and met with the chairman too.

223
00:14:59.606 --> 00:15:01.037
What did Dad say?

224
00:15:01.037 --> 00:15:02.976
I'm sure he must've come up with a plan.

225
00:15:04.346 --> 00:15:05.606
Don't rely on him.

226
00:15:05.846 --> 00:15:08.317
I deceived your father before coming back.

227
00:15:09.817 --> 00:15:11.646
You deceived Dad?

228
00:15:12.087 --> 00:15:14.756
What did you do? Why?

229
00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:19.327
He was threatening Seo Tae Soo to take the fall.

230
00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:21.557
He was threatening Seo Tae Soo?

231
00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:25.496
Father told him to say at a press conference...

232
00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:27.797
that he witnessed the car accident, abducted her,

233
00:15:27.937 --> 00:15:29.866
sold the diamonds, and raised her.

234
00:15:30.236 --> 00:15:31.967
If that happens, everything will be solved.

235
00:15:33.876 --> 00:15:35.337
Did he say he will do that?

236
00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:39.047
Do you want Seo Tae Soo to do that?

237
00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:42.746
If he's willing to do that,

238
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.047
that would be our best solution.

239
00:15:45.386 --> 00:15:47.187
There's a better one.

240
00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:49.417
You having a press conference.

241
00:15:50.587 --> 00:15:52.057
What did you say?

242
00:15:52.057 --> 00:15:54.927
Do you think I can go on after admitting that?

243
00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:57.526
You should rather just tell me to die.

244
00:15:58.026 --> 00:16:00.136
I guess you haven't seen the article yet.

245
00:16:01.067 --> 00:16:04.207
The article about Eun Seok getting swapped came out.

246
00:16:05.106 --> 00:16:06.907
Ji An and Ji Soo's photos are on it too.

247
00:16:07.506 --> 00:16:09.407
Although their faces were blurred out.

248
00:16:10.746 --> 00:16:12.447
They put out Ji Soo's photo too?

249
00:16:13.776 --> 00:16:15.677
Now, what will you do?

250
00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.016
You don't feel like my mother...

251
00:16:21.917 --> 00:16:23.016
at all.

252
00:16:24.087 --> 00:16:27.596
If I had to find one reason to thank you,

253
00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.167
it would be that you gave birth to me.

254
00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:32.967
We have to take down the article.

255
00:16:32.967 --> 00:16:34.766
Before Ji Soo's identity is known.

256
00:16:35.337 --> 00:16:38.307
All journalists will swarm in like bees.

257
00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:39.907
If you take it down,

258
00:16:39.907 --> 00:16:42.236
perhaps Tae Soo will take all the blame.

259
00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:43.276
But...

260
00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:45.876
his face and identity will be publicly known.

261
00:16:49.547 --> 00:16:52.087
So this is what you lied to Father about.

262
00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:54.116
He thinks...

263
00:16:54.587 --> 00:16:57.327
Tae Soo is going to have a press conference.

264
00:16:57.327 --> 00:16:58.386
Doesn't he?

265
00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:01.457
He has a heart problem.

266
00:17:01.457 --> 00:17:03.366
But his second daughter is using it to her advantage,

267
00:17:03.366 --> 00:17:05.397
and his first daughter is trying to get his help.

268
00:17:09.097 --> 00:17:11.137
We won't be using Tae Soo to our advantage.

269
00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:14.107
I did him a favor of lying to him because he's ill.

270
00:17:14.107 --> 00:17:15.506
It wasn't because I was scared of him.

271
00:17:16.677 --> 00:17:18.847
So you can choose now.

272
00:17:18.847 --> 00:17:20.546
Choose how you will take care of this.

273
00:17:21.177 --> 00:17:23.276
Will you admit all your mistakes in the past...

274
00:17:23.276 --> 00:17:25.217
Or will you listen to people talking...

275
00:17:25.217 --> 00:17:27.387
behind your back for the rest of your life?

276
00:17:34.657 --> 00:17:36.256
Until things get settled,

277
00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.167
I will keep my position as Vice Chairman.

278
00:17:42.597 --> 00:17:43.607
What do you think...

279
00:17:44.467 --> 00:17:45.937
I should do?

280
00:17:47.006 --> 00:17:48.907
If you are going to have a press conference,

281
00:17:48.907 --> 00:17:50.207
you'd have to bring Jo Soon Ok.

282
00:17:50.207 --> 00:17:52.476
If you do that, Tae Soo will be revealed.

283
00:17:53.177 --> 00:17:55.076
Soon Ok knows Tae Soo.

284
00:17:55.447 --> 00:17:57.887
Then Ji Soo's identity will be revealed too.

285
00:17:59.187 --> 00:18:00.457
I can't let that happen,

286
00:18:00.457 --> 00:18:02.217
so you will not have a press conference.

287
00:18:04.256 --> 00:18:05.457
Then?

288
00:18:06.457 --> 00:18:07.927
What am I supposed to say about the article?

289
00:18:08.397 --> 00:18:10.367
You should figure that out by yourself.

290
00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:32.546
Have you eaten dinner?

291
00:18:33.516 --> 00:18:34.556
I've eaten.

292
00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:37.157
I haven't eaten.

293
00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:39.326
Should we stop by a restaurant?

294
00:18:40.826 --> 00:18:42.256
I will stay in the car.

295
00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:47.226
I will try to take care of it as soon as possible.

296
00:19:48.726 --> 00:19:49.857
Right.

297
00:19:51.766 --> 00:19:52.766
However,

298
00:19:53.867 --> 00:19:54.897
if...

299
00:19:56.907 --> 00:19:58.066
and only if...

300
00:19:59.467 --> 00:20:00.607
it doesn't turn out well,

301
00:20:02.877 --> 00:20:04.177
what will you do?

302
00:20:12.286 --> 00:20:13.756
You can't think right now, can you?

303
00:20:16.286 --> 00:20:18.157
I found you a job.

304
00:20:18.556 --> 00:20:19.927
You said you don't have a plan yet.

305
00:20:20.857 --> 00:20:22.756
This is why I found a job for you.

306
00:20:26.026 --> 00:20:27.236
This is...

307
00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:29.796
strangely fascinating and funny.

308
00:20:31.137 --> 00:20:33.006
I guess it's true that your position shapes you.

309
00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:35.677
Since you've gone back, you've become the old you.

310
00:20:36.207 --> 00:20:37.306
Why?

311
00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:39.776
Are you going to find me a job abroad this time?

312
00:20:42.917 --> 00:20:44.246
You must be very scared.

313
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:47.016
Yes, I am scared.

314
00:20:47.857 --> 00:20:49.217
I am very scared.

315
00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:52.627
It must've come from your family.

316
00:20:53.496 --> 00:20:55.226
I'll be the bystander who gets hurt in a fight.

317
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.326
I will be stripped of everything...

318
00:20:57.326 --> 00:20:59.996
and become a laughingstock to everyone I know.

319
00:21:01.066 --> 00:21:03.197
Ji Soo won't be able to live as Ji Soo anymore.

320
00:21:03.736 --> 00:21:05.566
And I won't be able to live well as who I am.

321
00:21:06.937 --> 00:21:09.036
People in the world won't even...

322
00:21:09.036 --> 00:21:11.046
acknowledge me and Ji Soo as sisters.

323
00:21:11.147 --> 00:21:12.147
I will be the offender's daughter,

324
00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:13.417
and Ji Soo will be the victim.

325
00:21:14.617 --> 00:21:15.647
No.

326
00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:18.887
It won't be just the strangers.

327
00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:20.917
Ji Soo and I won't see each other as sisters too.

328
00:21:21.756 --> 00:21:23.187
No matter how it happened,

329
00:21:23.486 --> 00:21:26.127
Ji Soo became the victim and got swapped with me.

330
00:21:27.427 --> 00:21:29.397
Am I supposed to comfort her or apologize to her?

331
00:21:29.397 --> 00:21:30.867
It's killing me too.

332
00:21:32.266 --> 00:21:35.496
We're terrible. My family is terrible, isn't it?

333
00:21:42.776 --> 00:21:43.847
I am sorry.

334
00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:46.877
What happened to them while growing up?

335
00:21:47.276 --> 00:21:49.417
How could the sisters be so horrible to each other?

336
00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:52.447
"Sisters"?

337
00:21:56.016 --> 00:21:58.756
Are you suspecting Aunt Jin Hee?

338
00:22:01.857 --> 00:22:03.927
The only people who knew I was once Eun Seok...

339
00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:05.167
are the people at the gallery,

340
00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:07.697
your family, my family,

341
00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:09.367
Gwan Woo, and Hyuk's family.

342
00:22:10.707 --> 00:22:12.736
Who would secretly take photos of me?

343
00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:17.546
Why do you think it's her?

344
00:22:17.707 --> 00:22:19.207
During the gallery incident,

345
00:22:20.046 --> 00:22:21.347
she made Ms. Jin leak the news...

346
00:22:21.347 --> 00:22:22.776
about finding Eun Seok.

347
00:22:24.746 --> 00:22:26.516
Right.

348
00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:35.496
Well,

349
00:22:35.957 --> 00:22:37.667
We can't be sure though.

350
00:22:41.397 --> 00:22:44.207
You must be busy at work and at home.

351
00:22:46.236 --> 00:22:48.506
Why would you drive me?

352
00:22:48.506 --> 00:22:50.006
I could go with Hyuk.

353
00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:51.607
I told Mother that you're not going abroad...

354
00:22:51.607 --> 00:22:52.847
nor are we getting married.

355
00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:57.947
I didn't think she actually meant it.

356
00:23:01.586 --> 00:23:03.726
I assumed you'd do that.

357
00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:09.256
How...

358
00:23:11.296 --> 00:23:12.627
did you know?

359
00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:16.197
That she didn't mean it?

360
00:23:18.806 --> 00:23:20.107
I just knew.

361
00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:24.677
You've been inside of my family.

362
00:23:26.006 --> 00:23:27.377
In that short amount of time,

363
00:23:29.647 --> 00:23:31.286
you saw a lot of things.

364
00:23:39.256 --> 00:23:41.296
The first rumor was about Do Kyung doing drug,

365
00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.726
dating women, running away, and disappearing.

366
00:23:43.726 --> 00:23:45.496
The second was about finding Eun Seok.

367
00:23:45.496 --> 00:23:47.967
Ms. Seo, the daughter of Mr. Seo from Daebang-dong.

368
00:23:47.967 --> 00:23:50.607
The cause of the accident was fabricated.

369
00:23:50.637 --> 00:23:53.677
It began with a post written by Mr. Han...

370
00:23:53.677 --> 00:23:55.137
in 1992.

371
00:23:55.677 --> 00:23:58.506
The article was about swapping daughters.

372
00:23:58.506 --> 00:23:59.947
(Swapping daughters)

373
00:24:17.796 --> 00:24:19.597
I can't believe he stayed here.

374
00:24:20.437 --> 00:24:22.967
I want him to move back to Seoul.

375
00:24:38.016 --> 00:24:39.417
You arrived safely.

376
00:24:39.647 --> 00:24:40.687
Yes.

377
00:24:44.687 --> 00:24:47.097
Do Kyung, you can put down that article, right?

378
00:24:47.097 --> 00:24:48.627
It has to be put down.

379
00:24:49.157 --> 00:24:50.667
I will do whatever it takes.

380
00:24:51.266 --> 00:24:52.766
Hyuk, let's go.

381
00:24:52.766 --> 00:24:53.897
Now?

382
00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:57.167
But it looks too dangerous for two women to stay.

383
00:24:57.167 --> 00:24:59.407
Well, it'll be okay if we stay together.

384
00:24:59.407 --> 00:25:00.806
This is where Dad stays,

385
00:25:00.806 --> 00:25:02.437
so people don't know that we're here.

386
00:25:02.437 --> 00:25:04.147
I will protect Ji Soo.

387
00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:07.347
Okay.

388
00:25:08.076 --> 00:25:09.177
I will call you on my way back.

389
00:25:13.986 --> 00:25:16.387
How can you take your car when it's dangerous here?

390
00:25:16.657 --> 00:25:19.256
They'll need a car to get food.

391
00:25:26.736 --> 00:25:27.766
Get in my car.

392
00:25:34.476 --> 00:25:35.576
I'll get going then.

393
00:25:52.887 --> 00:25:53.927
Hey,

394
00:25:54.627 --> 00:25:56.526
I am Ji Soo's brother.

395
00:26:00.867 --> 00:26:02.536
Do you have a plan?

396
00:26:03.137 --> 00:26:04.836
The article came out this evening.

397
00:26:06.536 --> 00:26:07.836
What can I do to help?

398
00:26:08.407 --> 00:26:10.276
Please protect Ji Soo well.

399
00:26:21.687 --> 00:26:25.127
Soogyo-dong bulgogi and walnut cake.

400
00:26:27.457 --> 00:26:28.457
Gosh.

401
00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:30.627
It's freezing.

402
00:26:31.597 --> 00:26:33.697
How does Dad manage to wash himself here?

403
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.097
I know.

404
00:26:40.076 --> 00:26:42.377
Mom's really sorry, isn't she?

405
00:26:44.207 --> 00:26:45.806
She is.

406
00:26:46.847 --> 00:26:48.847
I'm tired. Let's sleep.

407
00:26:49.417 --> 00:26:50.546
Ji An.

408
00:26:52.687 --> 00:26:54.857
You said I was your other self.

409
00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:56.387
Why are you keeping distance from me?

410
00:27:01.796 --> 00:27:04.597
You're worried that you will be too sorry...

411
00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:06.796
when my identity gets revealed, right?

412
00:27:08.097 --> 00:27:09.836
Just worry about yourself.

413
00:27:11.806 --> 00:27:12.867
What?

414
00:27:13.576 --> 00:27:15.576
You are the one who will suffer the most...

415
00:27:16.407 --> 00:27:18.806
if the news about swapping us gets out.

416
00:27:20.717 --> 00:27:22.046
Aren't you scared?

417
00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:24.687
The journalists will swarm around the bakery.

418
00:27:24.687 --> 00:27:26.816
They will find out where you live too.

419
00:27:27.457 --> 00:27:29.217
Even Hyuk might get in trouble.

420
00:27:30.526 --> 00:27:34.127
Wouldn't Father and Do Kyung take care of it?

421
00:27:36.556 --> 00:27:39.427
I hope they really do this time.

422
00:27:40.296 --> 00:27:41.296
But...

423
00:27:43.167 --> 00:27:44.167
No.

424
00:27:50.506 --> 00:27:53.917
As your elder sister, I will tell you this.

425
00:27:53.917 --> 00:27:55.546
Nothing bad will happen.

426
00:27:56.147 --> 00:27:57.486
Trust me.

427
00:27:58.046 --> 00:27:59.786
What? "Elder sister"?

428
00:28:00.717 --> 00:28:02.357
I'm actually older than you, right?

429
00:28:02.717 --> 00:28:05.627
You are nine months younger than me.

430
00:28:06.957 --> 00:28:08.197
I know, but...

431
00:28:08.927 --> 00:28:10.826
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

432
00:28:12.627 --> 00:28:13.967

433
00:28:15.036 --> 00:28:19.236
I am here for you. So get some sleep.

434
00:28:22.336 --> 00:28:23.877
Stop it.

435
00:28:30.647 --> 00:28:32.286
So this is how it feels.

436
00:28:33.486 --> 00:28:34.486
What do you mean?

437
00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:38.357
After pretending to be your elder sister,

438
00:28:40.197 --> 00:28:41.726
I pity you.

439
00:28:42.657 --> 00:28:43.897
You look so weak.

440
00:28:45.397 --> 00:28:49.066
I can sympathize with you better.

441
00:28:51.207 --> 00:28:52.667
Then will you continue to be my elder sister?

442
00:28:54.207 --> 00:28:55.236
No.

443
00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:58.046
I like you being my elder sister.

444
00:28:58.677 --> 00:29:00.417
Be my elder sister for the rest of my life.

445
00:29:02.316 --> 00:29:03.447
Okay.

446
00:29:07.917 --> 00:29:10.226
You're scared, aren't you?

447
00:29:12.657 --> 00:29:15.127
I am. I am scared.

448
00:29:17.296 --> 00:29:19.226
This time, it is a little scary.

449
00:29:30.276 --> 00:29:31.306
By the way,

450
00:29:32.276 --> 00:29:34.377
doesn't the blanket smell like Dad?

451
00:29:42.217 --> 00:29:43.657
It smells like Dad.

452
00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:49.397

harder to bear than the humiliation?

00:34:40.717 --> 00:34:43.086
This is an article about Eun Seok.

505
00:34:43.287 --> 00:34:45.387
Aunt and Uncle are foolish for thinking...

506
00:34:45.387 --> 00:34:47.796
that Grandfather will be dismissed on this ground.

507
00:34:48.157 --> 00:34:50.327
I will have a meeting with the legal team.

508
00:34:50.597 --> 00:34:52.927
You and Do Kyung should contact the directors.

509
00:34:55.836 --> 00:34:57.307
I will meet Jin Hee first.

510
00:35:01.137 --> 00:35:02.307
No Jin Hee.

511
00:35:03.407 --> 00:35:04.447
What is it, Myung Hee?

512
00:35:04.747 --> 00:35:06.077
"What is it?"

513
00:35:06.776 --> 00:35:08.017
Was this it?

514
00:35:08.717 --> 00:35:11.347
So you're the one who's been releasing articles.

515
00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:14.217
Father is still alive, but you try dismissing him?

516
00:35:14.217 --> 00:35:15.557
Have you gone insane?

517
00:35:17.126 --> 00:35:20.327
Why can't Father be dismissed?

518
00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.227
It's about time he stepped down.

519
00:35:23.497 --> 00:35:25.626
He's old, he's not in good health,

520
00:35:25.626 --> 00:35:26.767
and he's not acting properly.

521
00:35:26.767 --> 00:35:27.836
What did you say?

522
00:35:28.637 --> 00:35:29.836
He's the founder of Haesung Corporation...

523
00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:31.037
and your father.

524
00:35:31.767 --> 00:35:34.006
She only cared about his first daughter.

525
00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:36.436
For 30 years, he pretended to compare who's better.

526
00:35:36.436 --> 00:35:38.506
But from the start, you were his chosen one.

527
00:35:38.606 --> 00:35:40.947
He always preferred you for being the first born.

528
00:35:41.117 --> 00:35:43.077
But who really grew this company?

529
00:35:43.217 --> 00:35:46.117
Was it Jae Sung? No. It was Myung Soo.

530
00:35:46.316 --> 00:35:49.316
He worked so hard for this company.

531
00:35:49.316 --> 00:35:50.356
Going to Europe?

532
00:35:50.787 --> 00:35:53.356
Do Kyung ran away from home just for a girl.

533
00:35:53.356 --> 00:35:54.526
Just because he's the eldest son,

534
00:35:54.526 --> 00:35:56.396
Father let him take my husband's position.

535
00:35:56.896 --> 00:35:58.467
Myung Soo will be the vice president once he's back?

536
00:35:58.467 --> 00:36:00.137
I believe that.

537
00:36:00.137 --> 00:36:02.236
But he'll only be a puppet just like your husband.

538
00:36:02.236 --> 00:36:05.066
Father will make a slave of him all his life.

539
00:36:05.066 --> 00:36:07.206
Until Do Kyung becomes the chairman.

540
00:36:11.407 --> 00:36:13.947
So you converted delusions into action.

541
00:36:15.146 --> 00:36:16.646
I'm impressed, Jin Hee.

542
00:36:16.816 --> 00:36:17.916
I told you.

543
00:36:18.586 --> 00:36:20.557
I also have ambitions.

544
00:36:20.557 --> 00:36:23.927
Do you think you can beat me only with some gossip?

545
00:36:25.157 --> 00:36:27.026
Father will be discharged in a few days.

546
00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:29.796
You're just like the fox with the sour grapes.

547
00:36:30.296 --> 00:36:31.827
Just cancel the board meeting,

548
00:36:31.827 --> 00:36:33.026
and retract the news articles.

549
00:36:33.267 --> 00:36:34.396
You do that.

550
00:36:35.267 --> 00:36:36.936
Are there any articles that are untrue?

551
00:36:37.467 --> 00:36:39.267
Why would I retract the news articles?

552
00:36:42.037 --> 00:36:43.677
You seem determined.

553
00:36:44.447 --> 00:36:47.177
Fine. Have it your way.

554
00:36:52.747 --> 00:36:54.486
I'll see you at the board meeting.

555
00:37:15.137 --> 00:37:16.537
Tae Soo.

556
00:37:17.077 --> 00:37:18.177
Is this good enough?

557
00:37:18.977 --> 00:37:21.146
Yes. Did you get the business card?

558
00:37:23.217 --> 00:37:24.847
It's just printed out.

559
00:37:24.847 --> 00:37:26.186
(Sanga Bank, Branch Manager Park Sung Yong)

560
00:37:31.126 --> 00:37:33.157
I'll see you at the board meeting then.

561
00:37:34.057 --> 00:37:35.126
Bye.

562
00:37:40.637 --> 00:37:44.236
The number you have dialed is not available.

563
00:37:46.807 --> 00:37:47.876
Yes, Director Kim.

564
00:37:48.836 --> 00:37:50.477
Chairman No is still in good health.

565
00:37:51.206 --> 00:37:52.947
We don't need the board meeting.

566
00:37:53.577 --> 00:37:55.717
Yes. Please don't worry.

567
00:37:56.517 --> 00:37:58.117
It's true that we found our daughter.

568
00:37:58.117 --> 00:38:00.756
She was happily raised by Mr. Seo's family.

569
00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:02.717
We won't respond...

570
00:38:03.017 --> 00:38:05.057
to any groundless rumors or canards.

571
00:38:05.356 --> 00:38:06.727
Let's just leave it at that.

572
00:38:06.856 --> 00:38:08.356
Okay. We understood.

573
00:38:44.997 --> 00:38:46.796
Hello? This is Reporter Nam Jung Soo.

574
00:38:47.197 --> 00:38:49.197
Hey, this is Seo Tae Soo speaking.

575
00:38:49.666 --> 00:38:53.037
How did you get the photos of my daughters?

576
00:38:53.236 --> 00:38:54.736
You're Mr. Seo Tae Soo?

577
00:38:54.736 --> 00:38:56.947
I'm in front of your office now.

578
00:38:56.947 --> 00:38:58.807
Come see me in 10 minutes.

579
00:38:58.807 --> 00:39:01.316
Otherwise, I'll go report you to the police!

580
00:39:01.316 --> 00:39:04.117
Please wait.

581
00:39:04.617 --> 00:39:06.956
I'm afraid I can't make it in 10 minutes.

582
00:39:07.017 --> 00:39:08.387
Please give me 30 minutes.

583
00:39:08.887 --> 00:39:11.356
By the way, are you really Seo Tae Soo?

584
00:39:11.356 --> 00:39:12.526
You crazy jerk.

585
00:39:12.526 --> 00:39:14.356
How dare you ask me that?

586
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:17.467
Just come here, and look at my face.

587
00:39:17.467 --> 00:39:19.427
Okay.

588
00:39:19.427 --> 00:39:21.497
But I'm out of office to cover the news.

589
00:39:21.497 --> 00:39:23.367
It'll take at least 30 minutes.

590
00:39:23.367 --> 00:39:24.867
Come here in 20 minutes!

591
00:39:25.736 --> 00:39:27.936
Hello? Hello?

592
00:39:32.046 --> 00:39:33.447
What should I do?

593
00:39:40.486 --> 00:39:42.117
Hello? This is Reporter Nam Jung Soo speaking.

594
00:39:42.117 --> 00:39:43.956
Are you the owner of the car 9281?

595
00:39:44.387 --> 00:39:45.756
I'm calling you from the parking lot.

596
00:39:46.026 --> 00:39:47.026
I accidentally...

597
00:39:47.026 --> 00:39:49.657
- hit your car. - What... What?

598
00:39:50.867 --> 00:39:52.867
Darn it!

599
00:40:03.506 --> 00:40:04.847
What happened?

600
00:40:04.876 --> 00:40:08.316
How could you crash a parked car like this?

601
00:40:08.316 --> 00:40:09.776
I'm so sorry, sir.

602
00:40:09.776 --> 00:40:11.847
As I was talking on the phone,

603
00:40:11.847 --> 00:40:13.517
I stepped on the gas...

604
00:40:13.717 --> 00:40:15.256
instead of stepping on the brakes.

605
00:40:15.256 --> 00:40:17.057
This is terrible.

606
00:40:17.427 --> 00:40:19.456
I have to leave as soon as possible.

607
00:40:20.057 --> 00:40:21.827
I'm very sorry.

608
00:40:27.166 --> 00:40:28.767
(Sanga Bank, Branch Manager Park Sung Yong)

609
00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:31.767
You work at a bank in the neighborhood.

610
00:40:32.706 --> 00:40:35.137
Do you want me to call you a taxi?

611
00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:38.776
Or would you like to use my car?

612
00:40:39.606 --> 00:40:41.376
I'm so sorry about this.

613
00:40:42.046 --> 00:40:43.847
I have to be there in 20 minutes.

614
00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:45.517
If you're busy,

615
00:40:45.517 --> 00:40:47.856
just give me your card, and leave.

616
00:40:48.287 --> 00:40:49.617
If you give me your keys,

617
00:40:49.617 --> 00:40:51.756
I'll leave it to an auto shop.

618
00:40:51.827 --> 00:40:55.526
And I'm 100 percent liable for this accident.

619
00:40:55.526 --> 00:40:59.227
You don't have to call your insurance company.

620
00:41:04.336 --> 00:41:06.166
- Thank you. - This is my card.

621
00:41:06.876 --> 00:41:08.577
I have to rush off now.

622
00:41:10.376 --> 00:41:11.747
So please let me use your car.

623
00:41:11.747 --> 00:41:12.807
Okay.

624
00:41:13.977 --> 00:41:15.017
Here.

625
00:41:18.086 --> 00:41:20.057
Just use the car, and call me when you arrive.

626
00:41:20.057 --> 00:41:21.657
I'll send one of my employees there.

627
00:41:29.296 --> 00:41:30.526
Why are you calling me?

628
00:41:30.526 --> 00:41:31.767
This isn't the right time.

629
00:41:31.767 --> 00:41:33.296
This is urgent.

630
00:41:33.736 --> 00:41:35.137
Ms. No Jin Hee.

631
00:41:35.137 --> 00:41:37.666
I just got a call from Seo Tae Soo.

632
00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:40.077
Seo Tae Soo?

633
00:41:40.077 --> 00:41:44.077
He sounds very upset, and he wants to see me.

634
00:41:44.077 --> 00:41:46.177
He even said he'd go to the police.

635
00:41:46.376 --> 00:41:48.916
So I'm on my way to meet him now.

636
00:41:49.046 --> 00:41:51.747
Can I interview him and release an article?

637
00:41:54.316 --> 00:41:57.327
It'd be more fun if he would do things himself.

638
00:41:57.486 --> 00:42:00.756
You'll still give me the follow-up news, right?

639
00:42:01.296 --> 00:42:02.727
You said it'd be a scoop.

640
00:42:02.997 --> 00:42:04.097
Of course.

641
00:42:04.927 --> 00:42:06.296
Call me after you meet him.

642
00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:08.666
I wonder what he's going to say.

643
00:42:08.896 --> 00:42:10.336
Okay.

644
00:42:18.477 --> 00:42:20.546
Tae Soo, you're a genius.

645
00:42:21.517 --> 00:42:23.517
Why would a genius be here doing this?

646
00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:25.347
Need makes the naked man run.

647
00:42:25.347 --> 00:42:27.456
How did you come up with that idea?

648
00:42:28.986 --> 00:42:32.026
When I started my business long ago,

649
00:42:32.526 --> 00:42:34.927
a guy from a rival company spread rumors...

650
00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:37.267
that my products contained toxic substances...

651
00:42:37.267 --> 00:42:40.537
when I got a big order from Guatemala.

652
00:42:40.537 --> 00:42:42.436
He even made fake files and spread it.

653
00:42:42.967 --> 00:42:44.736
Of course the order was cancelled.

654
00:42:45.336 --> 00:42:48.477
So I found out where he lived to catch him.

655
00:42:49.006 --> 00:42:51.546
His car was in the parking lot,

656
00:42:51.546 --> 00:42:53.717
but he never answered my calls.

657
00:42:54.316 --> 00:42:56.347
- I remember that. Right. - You know that, right?

658
00:42:56.347 --> 00:42:58.586
After waiting for half the day,

659
00:42:58.816 --> 00:43:00.486
I scratched his car.

660
00:43:00.486 --> 00:43:02.557
When I sent the security to his house after that,

661
00:43:02.557 --> 00:43:04.026
he came down immediately.

662
00:43:05.256 --> 00:43:08.157
You'd do anything in order to achieve your object.

663
00:43:08.227 --> 00:43:10.126
You're doing this again to save your daughters.

664
00:43:15.497 --> 00:43:17.767
I think Director Jung and Han turned away from us.

665
00:43:18.307 --> 00:43:20.477
Director Park is not answering my call either.

666
00:43:20.477 --> 00:43:21.807
Because of his lung problems,

667
00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:24.177
Grandfather received briefings in Hawaii.

668
00:43:24.807 --> 00:43:26.447
They're making an issue of it.

669
00:43:26.776 --> 00:43:28.477
They say we don't know when he'll collapse.

670
00:43:28.546 --> 00:43:29.677
It wasn't enough,

671
00:43:29.677 --> 00:43:31.646
so they were pouncing on the past events...

672
00:43:31.646 --> 00:43:34.617
with the issues of morality as justification.

673
00:43:35.416 --> 00:43:37.557
And to make matters worse, he collapsed.

674
00:43:38.356 --> 00:43:39.387
I'm sorry.

675
00:43:39.856 --> 00:43:42.256
What if Father is dismissed,

676
00:43:43.097 --> 00:43:44.566
and Jung Myung Soo becomes the chairman...

677
00:43:45.367 --> 00:43:47.767
at the general meeting of stockholders?

678
00:43:47.767 --> 00:43:49.097
Don't go overboard.

679
00:43:49.097 --> 00:43:50.907
We still have time before the board meeting.

680
00:43:54.336 --> 00:43:55.907
I should go tell Father.

681
00:43:55.907 --> 00:43:57.947
Do you want to break his heart?

682
00:43:58.407 --> 00:44:00.646
We should do what we can do first.

683
00:44:00.977 --> 00:44:02.776
This isn't a serious situation.

684
00:44:05.316 --> 00:44:06.657
He's right.

685
00:44:06.787 --> 00:44:10.086
I'll keep calling Director Park.

686
00:44:11.126 --> 00:44:13.126
Why didn't I know...

687
00:44:14.497 --> 00:44:16.256
that Jin Hee would go this far?

688
00:44:21.197 --> 00:44:22.997
It's true that we found our daughter.

689
00:44:23.097 --> 00:44:26.106
We respect her choice that she wants a normal life,

690
00:44:26.106 --> 00:44:27.876
so we won't make any comments on this matter.

691
00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:31.646
We will take strong action on any groundless rumors.

692
00:44:32.146 --> 00:44:33.247
That's the right answer.

693
00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:35.416
It sounds just like Haesung Corporation.

694
00:44:40.456 --> 00:44:43.256
Your father hid himself away after doing this?

695
00:44:44.787 --> 00:44:46.997
It was for the best.

696
00:44:46.997 --> 00:44:48.526
What about the doubts about 25 years ago?

697
00:44:48.526 --> 00:44:50.227
That's the biggest problem.

698
00:44:50.227 --> 00:44:51.666
Why did you not use Seo Tae Soo?

699
00:44:51.666 --> 00:44:52.896
He's the best solution.

700
00:44:53.666 --> 00:44:55.936
If the articles about him don't seem to work,

701
00:44:55.936 --> 00:44:57.907
you should use his daughters instead.

702
00:44:57.907 --> 00:44:59.367
He'd do anything for his children.

703
00:44:59.736 --> 00:45:01.807
That's why I put him down in advance.

704
00:45:01.807 --> 00:45:03.236
We can never do that.

705
00:45:03.606 --> 00:45:04.646
Why not?

706
00:45:06.046 --> 00:45:07.376
Because of Seo Ji An?

707
00:45:07.376 --> 00:45:08.977
That's the first reason.

708
00:45:09.517 --> 00:45:11.347
He's also Ji Soo's father.

709
00:45:12.017 --> 00:45:13.086
And there's more.

710
00:45:13.387 --> 00:45:14.717
I don't want to do that.

711
00:45:14.717 --> 00:45:16.387
I can't use an innocent person.

712
00:45:18.026 --> 00:45:20.727
I'll find another way.

713
00:45:22.927 --> 00:45:25.767
What if I get dismissed?

714
00:45:27.267 --> 00:45:28.537
How...

715
00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:30.436
You fool.

716
00:45:31.137 --> 00:45:33.206
You think I don't check things every day?

717
00:45:33.307 --> 00:45:34.637
Your father and mother...

718
00:45:34.637 --> 00:45:37.077
are busy picking up the pieces now.

719
00:45:37.847 --> 00:45:38.907
Yes.

720
00:45:40.017 --> 00:45:41.977
Ms. No Jin Hee and Mr. Jung Myung Soo...

721
00:45:42.276 --> 00:45:44.347
have done some work behind the scenes.

722
00:45:46.287 --> 00:45:48.787
They're just minnows after all.

723
00:45:49.256 --> 00:45:51.526
They won't get far from their small pond.

724
00:45:55.856 --> 00:45:57.497
I'll attend the board meeting.

725
00:45:59.097 --> 00:46:01.236
They can fire me if they want.

726
00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:03.967
Reporter Nam Jung Soo.

727
00:46:03.967 --> 00:46:05.907
(Reporter Nam Jung Soo)

728
00:46:05.907 --> 00:46:07.376
010...

729
00:46:09.106 --> 00:46:11.776
Thank you. I'll make it up to you.

730
00:46:14.947 --> 00:46:17.717
Please get me Nam Jung Soo's number.

731
00:46:17.717 --> 00:46:19.686
I'll do what I can.

732
00:46:20.287 --> 00:46:23.686
He'll be waiting. I was distracted by the meeting.

733
00:46:25.657 --> 00:46:28.827
(Seo Tae Soo)

734
00:46:32.427 --> 00:46:33.497
Hello?

735
00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:38.066
I'm in a hurry.

736
00:46:38.436 --> 00:46:39.907
Ms. No Jin Hee.

737
00:46:39.907 --> 00:46:42.506
I just got a call from Seo Tae Soo.

738
00:46:42.776 --> 00:46:46.077
You'll still give me the follow-up news, right?

739
00:46:46.506 --> 00:46:48.077
You said it'd be a scoop.

740
00:46:48.177 --> 00:46:49.247
This is...

741
00:46:49.677 --> 00:46:52.816
Yes. This was recorded earlier today.

742
00:46:53.316 --> 00:46:54.717
And this one...

743
00:46:56.017 --> 00:46:59.856
is a recording of the reporter's call...

744
00:46:59.856 --> 00:47:01.927
to Ms. No Jin Hee made via Bluetooth.

745
00:47:03.927 --> 00:47:07.097
Are you sure that one of these women are really...

746
00:47:07.097 --> 00:47:08.166
No Myung Hee's daughter?

747
00:47:08.497 --> 00:47:11.307
You want to check after you took a down payment?

748
00:47:11.706 --> 00:47:14.637
When will you give me the next tidbit?

749
00:47:15.977 --> 00:47:18.447
Choi Do Kyung's scandal with the fake daughter.

750
00:47:19.376 --> 00:47:21.517
Do you have proof of that?

751
00:47:21.816 --> 00:47:24.717
You're only showing that you're a rookie.

752
00:47:25.387 --> 00:47:28.916
We're in the same boat, and I paid you.

753
00:47:28.916 --> 00:47:31.887
Keep quiet, and row the boat.

754
00:47:32.887 --> 00:47:34.657
You'll get the info next week.

755
00:47:34.657 --> 00:47:37.467
I'll pay you the rest when the article's out, okay?

756
00:47:48.907 --> 00:47:51.247
I think this should do it.

757
00:47:52.776 --> 00:47:54.077
How did you...

758
00:47:55.447 --> 00:47:58.416
I said I'd get you the reporter's number.

759
00:47:59.686 --> 00:48:02.956
The desperate one moves first.

760
00:48:11.197 --> 00:48:12.197
Vice Chairman Choi.

761
00:48:14.896 --> 00:48:16.336
I think...

762
00:48:17.407 --> 00:48:19.436
someone took the photos deliberately.

763
00:48:20.006 --> 00:48:21.506
It was intentional.

764
00:48:22.736 --> 00:48:24.106
What do you mean?

765
00:48:24.706 --> 00:48:26.776
I think it's someone close by.

766
00:48:28.017 --> 00:48:30.447
There's a reason for everything.

767
00:48:30.847 --> 00:48:32.247
I'm a mess now,

768
00:48:32.416 --> 00:48:35.017
but until 10 years ago I was a businessman.

769
00:48:35.017 --> 00:48:37.057
I went through all sorts of things.

770
00:48:37.756 --> 00:48:41.557
Suspicious things are never coincidental.

771
00:48:42.256 --> 00:48:43.927
I do agree,

772
00:48:43.927 --> 00:48:45.727
but the swap of our daughters...

773
00:48:46.867 --> 00:48:48.497
There's nothing to gain.

774
00:48:48.497 --> 00:48:50.467
The other articles may, but not the swap.

775
00:48:50.736 --> 00:48:52.267
Yes, I know that.

776
00:48:52.267 --> 00:48:54.206
From the initial scandals to the articles.

777
00:48:54.206 --> 00:48:57.247
I looked up everything from 25 years ago too.

778
00:48:57.776 --> 00:48:59.747
The article about the past...

779
00:48:59.847 --> 00:49:01.776
targeted your family for sure,

780
00:49:01.776 --> 00:49:03.447
but not the one about our swapped kids.

781
00:49:04.686 --> 00:49:07.086
I'm the evil one for conning your family.

782
00:49:07.356 --> 00:49:10.526
As victims, that article wouldn't cause you harm.

783
00:49:11.086 --> 00:49:13.086
So why did they have it printed?

784
00:49:13.327 --> 00:49:14.727
With photos too?

785
00:49:15.697 --> 00:49:17.126
That's what I don't get.

786
00:49:19.197 --> 00:49:21.566
There must be someone behind it.

787
00:49:22.697 --> 00:49:23.706
What do you mean?

788
00:49:24.267 --> 00:49:27.936
The swapped daughters and your family...

789
00:49:28.177 --> 00:49:29.876
has Ji An in common.

790
00:49:30.977 --> 00:49:32.006
Ji An?

791
00:49:32.646 --> 00:49:33.977
I believe that...

792
00:49:34.276 --> 00:49:36.947
they'll print another article exposing...

793
00:49:37.146 --> 00:49:38.747
your son and Ji An's relationship.

794
00:49:38.747 --> 00:49:40.316
At a crucial time.

795
00:49:41.657 --> 00:49:43.486
Do Kyung's the target?

796
00:49:44.227 --> 00:49:46.697
There's no other reason for them to do this.

797
00:49:47.197 --> 00:49:50.166
It wouldn't be just to embarrass the family.

798
00:49:50.327 --> 00:49:51.896
The initial scandal...

799
00:49:51.896 --> 00:49:54.037
mentioned women, drugs, and leaving home.

800
00:49:54.037 --> 00:49:56.396
The fodder's already there.

801
00:49:56.706 --> 00:49:59.307
I think you're jumping to conclusions.

802
00:49:59.537 --> 00:50:01.137
Nobody knows about them,

803
00:50:01.307 --> 00:50:04.006
and this is just challenging the chairman.

804
00:50:04.206 --> 00:50:07.747
Please get me Nam Jung Soo's number.

805
00:50:08.416 --> 00:50:10.916
I'll do what I can.

806
00:50:45.146 --> 00:50:48.157
Are you sure that one of these women are really...

807
00:50:48.157 --> 00:50:49.186
No Myung Hee's daughter?

808
00:50:49.557 --> 00:50:52.356
You want to check after you took a down payment?

809
00:50:52.887 --> 00:50:56.026
When will you give me the next tidbit?

810
00:50:57.197 --> 00:50:59.727
Choi Do Kyung's scandal with the fake daughter.

811
00:51:00.497 --> 00:51:02.666
Do you have proof of that?

812
00:51:04.407 --> 00:51:05.436
I apologize.

813
00:51:05.666 --> 00:51:07.736
The agenda would be...

814
00:51:07.736 --> 00:51:09.407
to dismiss No Yang Ho...

815
00:51:09.677 --> 00:51:13.146
and appoint you as the CEO.

816
00:51:13.816 --> 00:51:16.577
To do that, you ruined our family's name.

817
00:51:16.646 --> 00:51:18.816
I thought it was for the greater good.

818
00:51:19.787 --> 00:51:20.986
And it's all true.

819
00:51:20.986 --> 00:51:22.617
Let's say you adopted our...

820
00:51:22.617 --> 00:51:24.787
father-in-law's way of stopping at nothing.

821
00:51:25.287 --> 00:51:27.756
But did you have to crush Do Kyung to get your way?

822
00:51:28.197 --> 00:51:30.267
When you want to become a CEO?

823
00:51:31.126 --> 00:51:34.066
You won't believe it, but I didn't know.

824
00:51:34.197 --> 00:51:35.767
Take down all the articles...

825
00:51:35.767 --> 00:51:37.907
about Eun Seok and our past.

826
00:51:38.506 --> 00:51:41.477
If they hear Do Kyung was slandered by his own aunt,

827
00:51:41.736 --> 00:51:43.646
would the shareholders vote for you?

828
00:51:44.577 --> 00:51:46.206
I can't cancel the meeting.

829
00:51:46.546 --> 00:51:49.276
Chairman No's dismissal is best for the company.

830
00:51:49.276 --> 00:51:50.986
I wouldn't dare demand that.

831
00:51:51.217 --> 00:51:53.287
You and your wife jumped into a fire already.

832
00:51:53.557 --> 00:51:55.657
You already prepared to release another article.

833
00:52:00.026 --> 00:52:01.657
You didn't meet Seo Tae Soo?

834
00:52:02.296 --> 00:52:03.367
Why not?

835
00:52:04.796 --> 00:52:05.867
Reporter Nam.

836
00:52:06.227 --> 00:52:08.867
Did you check the caller was really him?

837
00:52:09.267 --> 00:52:10.836
Is someone onto you?

838
00:52:14.436 --> 00:52:16.206
Let's talk again soon.

839
00:52:16.807 --> 00:52:17.807
Why did you...

840
00:52:18.077 --> 00:52:21.477
give the reporter information on the swap?

841
00:52:22.017 --> 00:52:24.347
That wasn't in our plan.

842
00:52:25.546 --> 00:52:27.517
I wanted to uproot them for good.

843
00:52:29.117 --> 00:52:31.186
Why don't you ruin the whole company?

844
00:52:31.686 --> 00:52:34.227
Do Kyung is what's keeping Haesung going.

845
00:52:34.427 --> 00:52:36.597
He's the chairman's oldest male heir.

846
00:52:36.796 --> 00:52:38.827
He needs to stand strong...

847
00:52:38.827 --> 00:52:40.537
for Haesung to survive.

848
00:52:40.736 --> 00:52:42.896
That's why I said we shouldn't touch him.

849
00:52:43.767 --> 00:52:45.267
You have no idea.

850
00:52:45.506 --> 00:52:47.407
Do Kyung's the biggest threat.

851
00:52:47.637 --> 00:52:49.637
We're only safe if he's gone.

852
00:52:49.637 --> 00:52:51.506
That's an issue for later.

853
00:52:51.706 --> 00:52:53.416
We can deal with it then.

854
00:52:53.677 --> 00:52:55.117
What I want...

855
00:52:55.117 --> 00:52:57.146
is to expand Haesung on my own.

856
00:52:57.146 --> 00:52:59.017
I don't want your family eradicated.

857
00:52:59.186 --> 00:53:01.387
The article on Eun Seok's disappearance...

858
00:53:01.387 --> 00:53:03.287
was enough to get Myung Hee and Jae Sung.

859
00:53:05.026 --> 00:53:07.896
But how did you find out about all that?

860
00:53:08.256 --> 00:53:09.497
Take it all down.

861
00:53:09.697 --> 00:53:11.767
Everything about Eun Seok's disappearance.

862
00:53:11.767 --> 00:53:13.537
All those articles?

863
00:53:14.097 --> 00:53:16.066
(Haesung's Heiress Found After 25 Years)

864
00:53:17.867 --> 00:53:19.867
(Haesung's Heiress Found After 25 Years)

865
00:53:23.807 --> 00:53:27.546
(Haesung's Heiress Found After 25 Years)

866
00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:35.517
(Haesung's Heiress Found After 25 Years)

867
00:53:35.517 --> 00:53:36.517
(No results)

868
00:53:38.057 --> 00:53:40.157
(No results)

869
00:54:00.077 --> 00:54:01.146
Aren't you cold?

870
00:54:02.046 --> 00:54:03.117
I am.

871
00:54:05.447 --> 00:54:07.316
Let's call Dad.

872
00:54:11.287 --> 00:54:12.986
(Call list)

873
00:54:14.396 --> 00:54:15.497
(Dad)

874
00:54:17.197 --> 00:54:18.296
Hi, Dad.

875
00:54:18.467 --> 00:54:21.836
Ji An, it's sorted out.

876
00:54:22.097 --> 00:54:23.407
What do you mean?

877
00:54:23.767 --> 00:54:24.967
The articles.

878
00:54:25.407 --> 00:54:26.606
They're gone.

879
00:54:27.436 --> 00:54:29.736
The articles are gone? How?

880
00:54:29.907 --> 00:54:33.247
Come to Seoul. Let's eat together.

881
00:54:33.916 --> 00:54:36.517
Okay, Dad. We'll leave right now.

882
00:54:36.517 --> 00:54:38.046
I'll call you on our way.

883
00:54:39.546 --> 00:54:42.416
Ji An, the article's gone. It's not there.

884
00:54:42.717 --> 00:54:44.626
(Requested page not found.)

885
00:54:45.686 --> 00:54:48.427
Even the article on Mom's past is gone.

886
00:54:48.597 --> 00:54:49.856
What happened?

887
00:54:56.066 --> 00:54:57.137
Hello?

888
00:54:57.267 --> 00:55:00.677
Your dad took down the articles.

889
00:55:00.907 --> 00:55:02.376
My dad did it?

890
00:55:02.706 --> 00:55:03.947
What do you mean?

891
00:55:04.407 --> 00:55:06.677
He helped me out big time.

892
00:55:07.316 --> 00:55:09.876
He helped you out?

893
00:55:12.046 --> 00:55:13.086
Okay.

894
00:55:22.097 --> 00:55:23.997
Honey, the articles are gone.

895
00:55:29.537 --> 00:55:32.267
Yes, Ji An, I saw it too. They're gone.

896
00:55:32.736 --> 00:55:34.637
Dinner? Sure.

897
00:55:34.907 --> 00:55:36.106
Goodbye.

898
00:55:39.407 --> 00:55:41.646
It's great to work together.

899
00:55:41.977 --> 00:55:44.887
We're at home and at work together.

900
00:55:46.146 --> 00:55:47.916
It's all thanks to Ji Soo.

901
00:55:48.057 --> 00:55:49.956
She always leaves early or misses work.

902
00:55:50.427 --> 00:55:52.526
See? Things keep happening.

903
00:55:52.986 --> 00:55:56.057
Ji Soo does nothing, but people around her...

904
00:55:56.057 --> 00:55:57.427
I'm going to...

905
00:55:58.697 --> 00:55:59.727
fire her.

906
00:56:01.396 --> 00:56:02.436
You'll fire her?

907
00:56:04.767 --> 00:56:06.066
Why?

908
00:56:06.776 --> 00:56:08.637
She realized she can't have...

909
00:56:08.637 --> 00:56:10.347
both love and a career.

910
00:56:11.106 --> 00:56:12.677
That's her fate.

911
00:56:12.977 --> 00:56:14.416
She has to choose one.

912
00:56:16.117 --> 00:56:17.517
Do you mean that?

913
00:56:19.117 --> 00:56:20.686
Is it because of me?

914
00:56:21.387 --> 00:56:22.456
Goodness.

915
00:56:23.017 --> 00:56:24.986
It's not about you.

916
00:56:26.057 --> 00:56:28.097
This bakery means too much to me.

917
00:56:28.896 --> 00:56:30.396
If it happened twice,

918
00:56:30.967 --> 00:56:33.227
it can always happen again.

919
00:56:36.267 --> 00:56:38.907
Hyuk will be upset.

920
00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:42.407
She's lucky to have a boyfriend like him.

921
00:56:43.037 --> 00:56:45.807
I need someone who can work for me entirely.

922
00:56:50.186 --> 00:56:51.717
The articles are gone.

923
00:56:51.717 --> 00:56:53.017
Lucky you.

924
00:56:54.416 --> 00:56:56.217
Have you heard from your future in-laws?

925
00:56:56.217 --> 00:56:57.756
I'm worried for you.

926
00:56:57.756 --> 00:56:59.727
You can leave our gathering.

927
00:56:59.727 --> 00:57:01.827
I understand if you feel embarrassed.

928
00:57:03.626 --> 00:57:05.427
They want me out?

929
00:57:11.907 --> 00:57:13.537
(0.1 million)

930
00:57:14.477 --> 00:57:15.537
What?

931
00:57:15.736 --> 00:57:18.146
Seo Hyun, are you frustrated and down?

932
00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:19.206
Come outside.

933
00:57:20.017 --> 00:57:21.776
You never wanted to see me again.

934
00:57:22.117 --> 00:57:24.217
I realized I still owe you one.

935
00:57:24.217 --> 00:57:25.217
Come out.

936
00:57:25.217 --> 00:57:27.686
I'll help you get rid of all your stress.

937
00:57:28.686 --> 00:57:30.887
Right hand on top, and left on the bottom, right.

938
00:57:30.887 --> 00:57:34.856
Then your second joints should be aligned.

939
00:57:36.227 --> 00:57:38.197
- Like this? - Yes, not bad.

940
00:57:38.396 --> 00:57:39.666
Okay, next.

941
00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:42.896
Look straight ahead, pull your chin down,

942
00:57:42.896 --> 00:57:45.836
keep your eye on the ball,

943
00:57:45.836 --> 00:57:47.137
and twist your waist...

944
00:57:47.137 --> 00:57:49.606
to hit the ball with all your might.

945
00:57:49.936 --> 00:57:51.046
Hey.

946
00:57:52.447 --> 00:57:54.217
Watch out, will you?

947
00:57:55.577 --> 00:57:57.287
Go outside, and watch me.

948
00:57:57.646 --> 00:57:58.747
Okay.

949
00:58:02.517 --> 00:58:03.626
Watch carefully.

950
00:58:21.477 --> 00:58:23.807
Nice one, Seo Hyun. Well done.

951
00:58:26.276 --> 00:58:27.617
Nice.

952
00:58:28.316 --> 00:58:29.316
Well done.

953
00:58:31.787 --> 00:58:33.086
Nice.

954
00:58:38.026 --> 00:58:40.657
Well? Is the stress gone?

955
00:58:47.537 --> 00:58:49.066
One more round, please.

956
00:59:20.997 --> 00:59:22.666
- It's Dad. - Dad!

957
00:59:37.517 --> 00:59:38.717
Dad.

958
00:59:42.586 --> 00:59:43.586
Where's Mom?

959
00:59:43.586 --> 00:59:45.956
I sent her inside because it's cold.

960
00:59:45.956 --> 00:59:48.396
Dad, how much can we eat today?

961
00:59:48.396 --> 00:59:50.296
We're sending Ji Tae to the army.

962
00:59:50.296 --> 00:59:52.267
Why do you want to stuff yourself?

963
00:59:52.267 --> 00:59:53.296
You can eat two portions.

964
00:59:55.537 --> 00:59:57.166
Okay then. Three.

965
00:59:58.367 --> 00:59:59.666
Can I eat four?

966
00:59:59.666 --> 01:00:01.106
Just one portion.

967
01:00:01.407 --> 01:00:02.936
- Just one portion. - Hey.

968
01:00:03.977 --> 01:00:05.077
Let's go inside. It's cold.

969
01:00:18.927 --> 01:00:20.727
- Dad. - Dad.

970
01:00:21.927 --> 01:00:23.157
Dad.

971
01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:28.267
Thank you, Dad. Thanks so much.

972
01:00:28.367 --> 01:00:30.166
Well done, Dad.

973
01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:31.606
Thank you.

974
01:00:33.066 --> 01:00:35.776
Is that why you suggested we come here to eat?

975
01:00:38.477 --> 01:00:41.347
Dad, can you eat bulgogi?

976
01:00:43.387 --> 01:00:44.486
Three portions.

977
01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:05.407
He checked both dashboard cameras just in case.

978
01:01:05.867 --> 01:01:07.106
This reporter...

979
01:01:07.106 --> 01:01:09.836
talked to No Jin Hee with a Bluetooth headset.

980
01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:12.847
So we got the whole conversation...

981
01:01:12.977 --> 01:01:14.876
and No Jin Hee's voice on tape.

982
01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.416
That's awesome.

983
01:01:16.916 --> 01:01:18.416
How did you think of that?

984
01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:21.756
From experience from my days as a businessman.

985
01:01:22.756 --> 01:01:24.856
How do you all about...

986
01:01:24.856 --> 01:01:26.227
what your dad did?

987
01:01:26.227 --> 01:01:27.227
What?

988
01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:34.367
Well, my dad told us what had happened.

989
01:01:35.137 --> 01:01:36.867
Soo A, eat all you can.

990
01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:38.907
I will. It's delicious.

991
01:01:39.137 --> 01:01:42.077
We used to be regulars here. Here.

992
01:01:42.177 --> 01:01:44.247
You should eat a lot too.

993
01:01:44.447 --> 01:01:45.477
- Here. - Okay.

994
01:01:53.387 --> 01:01:54.887
You're eating well.

995
01:01:55.057 --> 01:01:57.387
Why wouldn't I? The food's delicious.

996
01:01:58.887 --> 01:02:01.256
Mom's birthday, sometimes on our birthdays,

997
01:02:01.256 --> 01:02:02.626
and on your wedding anniversary.

998
01:02:03.566 --> 01:02:07.037
Right. Didn't you say you proposed to Mom here?

999
01:02:08.236 --> 01:02:10.467
My goodness. When did he tell you that?

1000
01:02:12.907 --> 01:02:14.336
Dad, you proposed?

1001
01:02:15.177 --> 01:02:16.847
How did you do it?

1002
01:02:17.506 --> 01:02:18.506
Today...

1003
01:02:19.606 --> 01:02:22.276
is our wedding anniversary.

1004
01:02:22.577 --> 01:02:25.387
- Today? - Today?

1005
01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:26.686
Yes.

1006
01:02:27.617 --> 01:02:30.126
You remembered that? My goodness.

1007
01:02:32.986 --> 01:02:34.856
Mom's embarrassed.

1008
01:02:35.197 --> 01:02:36.526
Mom.

1009
01:02:37.227 --> 01:02:38.626
- Hey, eat up. - Okay.

1010
01:02:41.566 --> 01:02:43.807
They vote on dismissing the chairman today.

1011
01:02:43.807 --> 01:02:45.106
What do you think?

1012
01:02:45.106 --> 01:02:47.236
They won't fire him. He's the founder.

1013
01:02:47.236 --> 01:02:48.637
If he is fired,

1014
01:02:48.637 --> 01:02:50.006
will Choi Do Kyung take over?

1015
01:02:50.006 --> 01:02:51.677
Is Jung Myung Soo out then?

1016
01:02:51.677 --> 01:02:53.717
Was he made president of Haesung Apparel...

1017
01:02:53.717 --> 01:02:55.376
to be made chairman next?

1018
01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:58.017
No Yang Ho wouldn't give up like that.

1019
01:02:58.017 --> 01:02:59.747
He's famous for starting from nothing.

1020
01:03:31.586 --> 01:03:33.657
Did you expect me to come in a wheelchair?

1021
01:03:34.086 --> 01:03:35.686
I left the hospital yesterday.

1022
01:03:39.256 --> 01:03:41.197
All members are present.

1023
01:03:41.197 --> 01:03:42.796
We shall begin the meeting.

1024
01:03:43.097 --> 01:03:44.867
The first agenda...

1025
01:03:45.066 --> 01:03:47.867
is the dismissal of Chairman No Yang Ho.

1026
01:03:48.296 --> 01:03:49.936
The causes are...

1027
01:03:49.936 --> 01:03:52.106
dereliction of duty due to poor health...

1028
01:03:52.106 --> 01:03:54.836
and his dogmatic style of business management.

1029
01:04:03.247 --> 01:04:05.517
Would you like to make your defense?

1030
01:04:07.057 --> 01:04:09.657
Why would I if I am here to get fired?

1031
01:04:10.657 --> 01:04:11.727
Go on.

1032
01:04:12.686 --> 01:04:14.526
Then we shall begin the vote...

1033
01:04:14.526 --> 01:04:16.356
on Chairman No's dismissal.

1034
01:04:16.827 --> 01:04:19.666
If you vote yes, please stand.

1035
01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:44.626
Out of the 20 present, 12 people agreed.

1036
01:04:44.787 --> 01:04:46.387
I announce that Chairman No...

1037
01:04:46.387 --> 01:04:48.396
will be removed from office.

1038
01:04:55.467 --> 01:04:58.436
Next, there's a demand from the shareholders...

1039
01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.276
on the new CEO.

1040
01:05:00.836 --> 01:05:02.436
The only candidate...

1041
01:05:02.436 --> 01:05:04.506
is Jung Myung Soo.

1042
01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.146
I have another suggestion.

1043
01:05:14.316 --> 01:05:15.586
Please speak.

1044
01:05:16.456 --> 01:05:18.057
I would like VC Choi Jae Sung...

1045
01:05:18.427 --> 01:05:20.526
and Haesung FNB's No Myung Hee...

1046
01:05:21.227 --> 01:05:23.026
both removed from the board.

1047
01:05:24.396 --> 01:05:25.526
What?

1048
01:05:59.867 --> 01:06:03.407
Did you sleep well?

1049
01:06:03.407 --> 01:06:04.537
No.

1050
01:06:05.936 --> 01:06:08.577
How's the test result?

1051
01:06:09.736 --> 01:06:11.177
You...

1052
01:06:12.447 --> 01:06:14.977
do have a stomach cancer.

1053
01:06:21.956 --> 01:06:23.526
I see.

1054
01:06:25.057 --> 01:06:27.356
But why did the last hospital...

1055
01:06:27.356 --> 01:06:29.827
There are different types of stomach cancers.

1056
01:06:30.867 --> 01:06:32.967
Do you see this?

1057
01:06:33.497 --> 01:06:35.637
This is Borrmann type 4.

1058
01:06:35.896 --> 01:06:38.137
It's spread at the bottom.

1059
01:06:38.137 --> 01:06:42.307
So it's sometimes not found in biopsies.

1060
01:06:43.847 --> 01:06:44.847
Does that mean...

1061
01:06:46.347 --> 01:06:48.717
it was a misdiagnosis?

1062
01:06:49.447 --> 01:06:50.887
You can say that.

1063
01:06:55.456 --> 01:06:56.456
Then...

1064
01:06:57.626 --> 01:07:01.097
how much time do I have left?
