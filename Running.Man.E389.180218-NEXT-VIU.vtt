00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:10.908
(Recap)

2
00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.818
(Lee Da Hee, a tall rookie of the variety shows)

3
00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.648
(Koo Ha Ra, the athletic idol singer)

4
00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:18.717
(Seor In A, super rookie of 2018)

5
00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:19.857
That's Seor In A.

6
00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:21.787
(Mina of Gugudan, the bubbly one)

7
00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:27.098
(These 4 beautiful ladies flew to Jeju Island to join the race.)

8
00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:30.068
(Or could they be the best TV personalities for variety shows?)

9
00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:31.267
(Are they idol singers?)

10
00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.068
(No, they are the crazy ladies.)

11
00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:38.037
(These queens of variety shows came to take over Running Man.)

12
00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.677
(A partner race, Rule of Collection)

13
00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:44.418
(Each partner chooses a number from 1 to 6.)

14
00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:47.948
(The pairs with the highest and lowest sums of numbers win.)

15
00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:53.418
(The remaining pairs will face the water bomb.)

16
00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:58.058
(The water bomb is at stake on the last mission, Pirate Roulette Quiz.)

17
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.958
(The reckless members choose Betting Pirate with the hope of winning.)

18
00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.967
(The unfortunate members make it hard for the pirate to rest.)

19
00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.937
(Let's insert it on the count of three for our partnership's sake.)

20
00:01:07.937 --> 00:01:11.008
You're the worst. You're such a jerk.

21
00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:14.778
(Kwang Soo has become a jerk. What will happen to him now?)

22
00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:18.648
- Please pop. Please. - "You're such a jerk."

23
00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:19.847
(The last question will determine the winning pair.)

24
00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:22.118
Do you want to do it together this time?

25
00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:23.187
- Okay. - Are you sure?

26
00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:24.588
I'm sure it will pop.

27
00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:26.857
You have to insert it this time.

28
00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:28.957
If you do it at the same time, we won't know which one caused it.

29
00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:30.558
I know. That's the point. All right.

30
00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:33.457
- If we get this one, we will win. - We can win then.

31
00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:35.868
All right. Stick it in on the count of three.

32
00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:38.767
- All right. 1, 2, 3. - She's counting.

33
00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:42.467
- I can't believe you! - No, no.

34
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:44.638
(Kwang Soo's hand still doesn't move.)

35
00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.278
I missed my cue. I missed my cue.

36
00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:49.948
- Hey, "1, 2, 3." - I just missed my window.

37
00:01:49.948 --> 00:01:51.547
- How could you miss this? - I'm sorry.

38
00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:53.448
I'm sorry. I really am. You counted out of nowhere.

39
00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:55.388
You didn't give me a heads-up.

40
00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:57.987
Had you counted before to let me know, I would've done it.

41
00:01:57.987 --> 00:01:59.618
Jong Kook, she's so cute.

42
00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:01.258
- My gosh, she's the cutest. - One more time.

43
00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:03.558
- 1, 2, 3. Then you insert it. - No, I mean...

44
00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:05.957
You could've said, "1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3."

45
00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:07.898
- You went, "1, 2, 3." - You really are a jerk.

46
00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.067
- It just caught me off guard. - You are such a jerk.

47
00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.067
I can't believe you. Anyway, just insert it then. I'll watch.

48
00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:12.398
Mine didn't pop.

49
00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:13.898
(Pressured)

50
00:02:13.898 --> 00:02:14.907
- This is driving me crazy. - I bet it will pop.

51
00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.708
(She's watching him intently.)

52
00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:18.338
I bet it's going to pop.

53
00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:19.838
I'm sure of it.

54
00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:20.838
(He's serious.)

55
00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:22.907
Kwang Soo, if yours pop this time,

56
00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:24.477
I think I'm going to be really angry.

57
00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.148
You won't be friends with Da Hee anymore.

58
00:02:26.678 --> 00:02:28.847
Da Hee knows the answer.

59
00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:29.847
(Kwang Soo has nowhere to turn.)

60
00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:30.847
This is crazy.

61
00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:31.917
(What will happen to Kwang Soo?)

62
00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:33.917
Okay!

63
00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:34.958
(He succeeds.)

64
00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.657
- We did it. - You have three left.

65
00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:37.858
You have the opposite feelings.

66
00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:40.097
(Will I escape the curse of bad luck starting today?)

67
00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:43.268
- Let's take a seat. - You're not challenging it, right?

68
00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:45.567
All right. Then you will have the chance to answer the question first.

69
00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:46.738
- Okay. - Good luck.

70
00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.567
The answer is number one, boiled pork.

71
00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:51.977
(Confident Da Hee chooses number 1, boiled pork.)

72
00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.078
- Boiled pork. - It's because...

73
00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:54.847
Da Hee knows how trotters...

74
00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:57.447
- originated. - They didn't exist back then.

75
00:02:57.648 --> 00:03:00.377
And I was slightly confused with chicken soup.

76
00:03:00.377 --> 00:03:02.387
Since it's soup, I thought it'd be boiled down.

77
00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:06.717
- So to get it delivered... - Why do you two stand like that?

78
00:03:08.558 --> 00:03:10.428
Wait, no. It's not what you think.

79
00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:12.727
- Are you models, posing for shots? - No.

80
00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:14.667
- It's not what you think. - You always stand behind her.

81
00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.067
- Why do you do that? - I want her to be on camera.

82
00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:20.567
Both of them are cunning.

83
00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.667
Insert it for number one, boiled pork.

84
00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:24.208
- Okay. - Number one, boiled pork.

85
00:03:24.977 --> 00:03:25.977
Okay!

86
00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:27.278
(They make a bet on an answer.)

87
00:03:27.278 --> 00:03:28.447
Number one, boiled pork.

88
00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:30.847
(Is number 1, boiled pork the right answer?)

89
00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:32.447
(It's wrong.)

90
00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:34.278
I can't believe this. No way.

91
00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.887
- I told you so. - Hey, I told you...

92
00:03:35.887 --> 00:03:37.757
- boiled pork wasn't it. - My gosh, seriously.

93
00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:39.887
- Kwang Soo should've answered it. - This was...

94
00:03:40.757 --> 00:03:45.727
(This isn't what we were expecting.)

95
00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:48.528
Ha Ra will get it right.

96
00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:49.627
(Ha Ra and Jae Seok will try.)

97
00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:50.828
Number five, hangover soup.

98
00:03:50.967 --> 00:03:54.067
Everyone, you think it's not the answer because it's soup.

99
00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.067
You're wrong.

100
00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.567
The soup would've spilled.

101
00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:57.808
(5, hangover soup)

102
00:03:57.808 --> 00:04:00.078
- I'll insert 5. Jae Seok. - 5.

103
00:04:00.078 --> 00:04:01.578
- You should choose. - No, no.

104
00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:02.748
You should insert three.

105
00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:06.118
(Popping)

106
00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:08.988
See?

107
00:04:09.018 --> 00:04:10.187
Let's change. Hurry!

108
00:04:10.887 --> 00:04:12.787
- We should go. Six? - This is crazy.

109
00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:14.358
- Five. - What am I going to do?

110
00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:15.558
- Let's do 3. - 3?

111
00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:17.187
I'm not sure if we'll have a chance.

112
00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:18.957
How could it pop at our first try?

113
00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:21.368
(So Min places her bet in the midst of the commotion.)

114
00:04:21.368 --> 00:04:22.397
- I thought it was correct. - I can't believe this.

115
00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:24.668
(And she fails.)

116
00:04:24.668 --> 00:04:27.368
(It's the disappointing end of a reckless player.)

117
00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:28.608
She tried.

118
00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:30.637
- I'm going all in with six. - Did she just try that?

119
00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.238
I'm going all in with six.

120
00:04:32.837 --> 00:04:34.577
We need one for the Answer Pirate.

121
00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:36.207
Three.

122
00:04:36.808 --> 00:04:37.817
Chicken soup.

123
00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:41.187
No. Should I try one?

124
00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:42.187
Yes, try it.

125
00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:43.718
- Besides, - Go for it.

126
00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:45.187
- there's only three options. - Go for it.

127
00:04:45.187 --> 00:04:46.187
(They pick number 3, chicken soup.)

128
00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:52.197
(This lady who staked everything she had...)

129
00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:56.098
(is the super rookie among the unlucky ones.)

130
00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:57.197
It has to pop.

131
00:04:57.197 --> 00:05:03.337
(She couldn't say anything as she failed 3 times in a row.)

132
00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:05.178
I guess her name didn't mean what I thought it meant.

133
00:05:05.178 --> 00:05:09.108
(Will she be able to redeem herself this time?)

134
00:05:09.978 --> 00:05:11.577
- I mean, seriously. - Hey!

135
00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:15.048
(As expected, she is still the unlucky one.)

136
00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.118
- Come here! - I mean, seriously.

137
00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:20.058
Hey! Darn you. Come here!

138
00:05:20.058 --> 00:05:22.187
What's wrong with you? What are you?

139
00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:25.298
We should perform an exorcism. Prepare for an exorcism.

140
00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:28.228
We have to do an exorcism on her. She's giving me the chills.

141
00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.027
- Yes, do it. - We have to perform one.

142
00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.137
- Who are you? - In A.

143
00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.837
- You're not In A, are you? - This is unbelievable.

144
00:05:34.837 --> 00:05:35.937
You're not her, right?

145
00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:38.478
We have 10, right?

146
00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:40.337
But what's the answer?

147
00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:42.478
What if we have the wrong answer?

148
00:05:42.848 --> 00:05:44.048
It doesn't matter. We must go for it.

149
00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:45.817
Look at those love birds.

150
00:05:45.817 --> 00:05:47.118
(What's Korea's first delivery food?)

151
00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:49.647
1, 2, 3.

152
00:05:50.348 --> 00:05:51.687
- If they succeed with nine... - My goodness.

153
00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:55.827
(What happened?)

154
00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:56.827
We won!

155
00:05:56.858 --> 00:05:57.858
- What just happened? - Yes!

156
00:05:58.627 --> 00:06:01.928
(Se Chan and Mina, who did nothing, win the game.)

157
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.368
The victory goes to Se Chan's team.

158
00:06:07.538 --> 00:06:09.468
- Yes! - It's their win. The answer is...

159
00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:11.238
- What's the answer? - It's number five, hangover soup.

160
00:06:11.837 --> 00:06:13.007
- We were going to go for that. - Hey.

161
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:16.077
We should've thought it as rice soup.

162
00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:18.118
(People cooked the soup during the night, and it arrived at dawn.)

163
00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:20.817
- They won't change. - No, they probably won't.

164
00:06:20.817 --> 00:06:22.218
- It's over then. - Hey, this was...

165
00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:23.488
- All right. - The stage.

166
00:06:23.488 --> 00:06:25.218
Let me reveal the final sums.

167
00:06:25.788 --> 00:06:28.788
- The highest sum, 10 points, - Good for you, Kwang Soo.

168
00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.158
Goes to Kwang Soo and Da Hee.

169
00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:34.468
- And... - "And"?

170
00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:36.928
Jae Seok and Ha Ra have 10 points too.

171
00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.168
- Come on. - Except for these three pairs,

172
00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.108
the rest will face the water bomb.

173
00:06:43.108 --> 00:06:44.108
(They'll face the penalty.)

174
00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:45.937
- We did it! We did it! - It's over.

175
00:06:45.937 --> 00:06:47.277
(They set out to get the penalty in the snowing weather.)

176
00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.007
Let's go.

177
00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:52.918
(Jong Kook, So Min, and In A are exempted from the penalty.)

178
00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:56.187
The three of you will get the water bomb now.

179
00:06:56.387 --> 00:06:57.387
One,

180
00:06:58.587 --> 00:07:00.817
- two, - It'll be warm!

181
00:07:01.658 --> 00:07:02.788
- 3! - 3!

182
00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.897
(Is this a warm shower?)

183
00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:11.637
(It's fun to watch others get the water bomb.)

184
00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:15.007
(His hair looks like seaweed.)

185
00:07:15.007 --> 00:07:16.108
- I feel so bad. - Good job.

186
00:07:16.108 --> 00:07:18.377
- Well done. - Great work, everyone.

187
00:07:18.377 --> 00:07:20.678
(The race in Jeju Island begins now!)

188
00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:26.017
(Part 2 of Jeju Island Special, Roads of Jeju's Famous Locations)

189
00:07:26.017 --> 00:07:30.587
(Find the tastiest, coolest, and the most entertaining activities.)

190
00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:35.558
(The chaotic race in Jeju Island begins now.)

191
00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:36.858
This is just for you.

192
00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:40.158
- Hello. Hi. - Hello.

193
00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:41.327
- Hi. - Hi.

194
00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.798
- Good morning. - Hello.

195
00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:45.668
- Welcome. - Morning, everyone.

196
00:07:45.668 --> 00:07:46.697
It's warm.

197
00:07:46.937 --> 00:07:51.007
- Haha is all dressed up today. - Right.

198
00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:53.478
- He got excited about this trip. - His outfit tells me...

199
00:07:53.478 --> 00:07:54.978
- "Head, shoulder, knees, and feet". - He has a problem.

200
00:07:54.978 --> 00:07:56.507
- "Swag". - He dressed up like G-Dragon,

201
00:07:56.507 --> 00:07:59.748
but he's not even close.

202
00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:02.017
(Try to copy me if you can.)

203
00:08:03.488 --> 00:08:06.257
Now that I see him in person, Haha is no match for him.

204
00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:10.058
- He also talks like G-Dragon too. - Right.

205
00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:11.827
"Okay."

206
00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.897
- Haha, don't go overboard. - I think this is removable.

207
00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:17.627
It's not that it's removable. He's afraid he might lose it,

208
00:08:17.627 --> 00:08:19.538
- so he tied it there. - Hey, that's enough.

209
00:08:19.538 --> 00:08:21.937
- Don't mental institutions do this? - Stop it.

210
00:08:22.207 --> 00:08:23.337
- Don't they? - Cool it.

211
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:25.337
- I think they do this there. - I saw that too.

212
00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:27.178
- Do you go to soccer classes then? - Hey.

213
00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:28.947
It's better to get this over with now.

214
00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:30.848
Are you here to take coaching classes or what?

215
00:08:30.848 --> 00:08:32.718
I'm not lying when I saw this, but lately, Yu Seok, the cameraman,

216
00:08:32.718 --> 00:08:34.078
dresses better than you.

217
00:08:34.078 --> 00:08:35.488
(The cameraman is a better dresser.)

218
00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:37.858
Look. He's wearing the navy jacket.

219
00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:40.057
- Wear something like that. - He has a lot of clothes. I see.

220
00:08:40.057 --> 00:08:42.088
Look at the navy jacket. That looks nice.

221
00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.958
- That's a nice color. - His clothes are colorful.

222
00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:48.167
Today, it's a relaxing tour where you can enjoy the nature.

223
00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:51.938
This race in Jeju Island is called Bingo to the Flowery Road.

224
00:08:51.938 --> 00:08:53.468
- He said it's a relaxing tour. - This is nice.

225
00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:55.007
- "Flowery Road"? - "Bingo to the Flowery Road"?

226
00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:56.007
(Flowery road? Relaxing?)

227
00:08:56.267 --> 00:08:59.208
- This will be a 4-on-4 team match. - 4-on-4?

228
00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:02.677
You select and carry out a mission in a square.

229
00:09:02.677 --> 00:09:05.417
If you succeed, you win a square on the bingo board...

230
00:09:05.547 --> 00:09:07.688
and get an opportunity to win a Chance Card.

231
00:09:07.688 --> 00:09:08.848
Okay.

232
00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:11.488
The first team to complete a line wins.

233
00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.718
The winning team takes the best accommodation,

234
00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:15.527
the luxury suite.

235
00:09:15.527 --> 00:09:16.627
- The suite! - The suite!

236
00:09:17.698 --> 00:09:22.667
(The winning team gets to rest in the luxury suite.)

237
00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:25.238
(Let's go to the suite.)

238
00:09:25.238 --> 00:09:26.238
I have never been to one.

239
00:09:26.238 --> 00:09:28.968
The losing team sleeps on an ice rink.

240
00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:30.137
- An ice rink? - An ice rink?

241
00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:32.277
(Do the losers have to sleep on an ice rink?)

242
00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:33.608
- An ice rink? - Yes.

243
00:09:33.608 --> 00:09:35.248
- The losing team sleeps on it. - That's the worst.

244
00:09:36.078 --> 00:09:40.777
(The losing team gets to be cozy in the tents on an ice rink.)

245
00:09:40.777 --> 00:09:42.088
Your face might become paralyzed.

246
00:09:42.088 --> 00:09:45.188
People who sleep on the ice rink might not wake up the next day.

247
00:09:45.257 --> 00:09:47.517
Sleeping on an ice rink is too much.

248
00:09:47.557 --> 00:09:49.887
Those who sleep on the ice rink will be...

249
00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.858
3 members from the losing team and 1 member from the winning team.

250
00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:53.858
- Why? - Why?

251
00:09:53.858 --> 00:09:57.027
(3 members from the losing team and 1 member from the winning team)

252
00:09:57.068 --> 00:09:58.598
Why would you choose one member from the winning team?

253
00:09:59.368 --> 00:10:02.468
The winning team saves one member from the losing team,

254
00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:05.738
and the losing team selects one member from the winning team.

255
00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:07.338
There are so many twists and turns.

256
00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:09.377
That means Jae Seok will sleep on the ice rink...

257
00:10:09.377 --> 00:10:11.318
whether he wins or loses.

258
00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:13.147
- You are the same. - That's not true.

259
00:10:13.147 --> 00:10:15.417
- You are the same. - Speak for yourself.

260
00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:17.917
We have two people who are most likely to be selected.

261
00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.218
- What are you talking about? - One of them will be selected.

262
00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:20.818
The only way I can save myself...

263
00:10:20.818 --> 00:10:22.757
is by winning with Jae Seok in my team.

264
00:10:22.757 --> 00:10:24.797
That's right. That's the only way.

265
00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:28.167
I can already picture who will sleep...

266
00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.167
on the ice rink.

267
00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:31.838
Please bring in the bingo board.

268
00:10:33.468 --> 00:10:35.407
What is that? There are a lot of options.

269
00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:38.338
There are a lot of options.

270
00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:39.777
(Various places in Jeju Island are included.)

271
00:10:39.777 --> 00:10:43.777
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

272
00:10:44.248 --> 00:10:47.147
(The missions of Bingo to the Flowery Road...)

273
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:50.488
(lets them enjoy all aspects of the beautiful island.)

274
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:53.557
"The first tangerine tree". "Korean peninsula in Jeju Island".

275
00:10:53.557 --> 00:10:55.657
- I know what it is. - It's beautiful.

276
00:10:57.588 --> 00:11:01.127
(The first tangerine tree of Jeju Island dates back to 1911.)

277
00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:05.167
(The shape of the Korean peninsula is a treasure of the Olle Trail...)

278
00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:08.208
(that is located in Namwon Keuneong Promenade.)

279
00:11:08.338 --> 00:11:10.407
What's the oldest building in Jeju Island?

280
00:11:12.078 --> 00:11:16.407
(Gwandeogjeong breathes with the history since 1448.)

281
00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:23.988
(The biggest Camellia Hill in Asia)

282
00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:26.417
I should eat the meat noodles with 60 years of traditions.

283
00:11:26.417 --> 00:11:28.828
I told you that I want to eat it on my way here.

284
00:11:28.887 --> 00:11:31.698
- We should eat black cattle. - Black cattle.

285
00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:35.527
(Black cattle is a natural monument that was given to the king.)

286
00:11:35.527 --> 00:11:38.338
(The oldest meat noodles restaurant serves a delicious dish.)

287
00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:42.907
There is "eliminating the name tag of the target".

288
00:11:42.907 --> 00:11:44.907
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

289
00:11:44.978 --> 00:11:46.108
My goodness.

290
00:11:46.838 --> 00:11:49.248
(It's not fitting for a healing trip.)

291
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:50.948
(Confident)

292
00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:53.818
Before the race, you will be divided into two teams.

293
00:11:54.488 --> 00:11:57.248
In the count of three,

294
00:11:57.248 --> 00:11:59.818
all members must either sit or stand.

295
00:12:00.157 --> 00:12:02.488
When 4 members sit down and 4 members stand up,

296
00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:05.027
the two teams will be divided.

297
00:12:05.297 --> 00:12:06.728
The team members are important.

298
00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:08.397
(The team members are important for victory.)

299
00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:09.797
Let's go.

300
00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:12.098
We either sit or stand.

301
00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:13.297
(Odd numbers sit and even numbers stand at first.)

302
00:12:13.297 --> 00:12:15.608
- What should I do? - Up and down! In 1, 2...

303
00:12:15.608 --> 00:12:18.108
(You become a team with the members who choose the same position.)

304
00:12:18.108 --> 00:12:19.177
My goodness.

305
00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.448
My goodness.

306
00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:23.777
(5 members are standing, and 3 members are sitting.)

307
00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.017
The teams haven't been decided yet.

308
00:12:25.017 --> 00:12:27.218
- Kwang Soo stood up a bit late. - No, I didn't.

309
00:12:27.218 --> 00:12:29.348
- Sit or stand at three. - Okay.

310
00:12:29.387 --> 00:12:30.387
Here we go.

311
00:12:30.387 --> 00:12:31.787
Up and down! In 1, 2...

312
00:12:31.787 --> 00:12:34.988
(Are the teams decided this time?)

313
00:12:35.858 --> 00:12:37.157
It's 4 versus 4.

314
00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:39.198
Up and down! In 1, 2...

315
00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:44.228
It's 4 versus 4.

316
00:12:44.328 --> 00:12:45.698
We can win with these members.

317
00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:47.667
(Haha, Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and So Min are standing.)

318
00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:48.868
We can win with these members.

319
00:12:48.938 --> 00:12:50.608
I am a bit surprised.

320
00:12:50.738 --> 00:12:52.978
I am a bit surprised.

321
00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:54.377
Victory is ours.

322
00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:57.407
(Let's see.)

323
00:12:57.407 --> 00:12:58.647
Hold on. Hold on.

324
00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:00.547
- Give me a chance. - Let's do it once again.

325
00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:02.588
It won't be fun with these teams.

326
00:13:02.588 --> 00:13:03.848
- It won't be fun. - We will be destroyed.

327
00:13:03.848 --> 00:13:05.517
- Let's try it one more time. - We will be destroyed.

328
00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:06.787
- This won't work. - Let's try it one more time.

329
00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:07.887
- This won't work. - This won't work.

330
00:13:08.027 --> 00:13:10.728
- Victory is ours. - Let's sleep in the suite.

331
00:13:10.728 --> 00:13:12.427
- Let's sleep in the suite. - This is great.

332
00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:13.527
Seriously.

333
00:13:13.897 --> 00:13:15.728
- We are set. - This is great.

334
00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:17.498
Okay. We will sleep on the ice rink.

335
00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:20.637
- It won't be fun. - This won't work.

336
00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.938
We are the varsity team, and they are the junior varsity team.

337
00:13:22.938 --> 00:13:26.807
(We are the varsity team, and they are the junior varsity team.)

338
00:13:27.677 --> 00:13:29.208
- What are you talking about? - For goodness' sake.

339
00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.277
Junior varsity team, my foot!

340
00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:31.547
Just you wait.

341
00:13:32.147 --> 00:13:34.787
- This is new. - "Just you wait"?

342
00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:36.848
Are these the teams?

343
00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:38.488
We have everything.

344
00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:40.887
We have strength, intellect,

345
00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:42.358
and flippant charms. We have everything.

346
00:13:42.358 --> 00:13:43.688
We are set.

347
00:13:43.688 --> 00:13:45.527
We don't have anything.

348
00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:48.728
Your team doesn't have stamina.

349
00:13:48.968 --> 00:13:50.968
- Stamina? - They have no stamina.

350
00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:53.368
- They have no stamina. - This is the worst.

351
00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:55.007
- We are the weakest team. - What should I do?

352
00:13:55.007 --> 00:13:56.137
We are the weakest team.

353
00:13:56.137 --> 00:13:57.907
There usually were Team Jae Seok and Team Jong Kook.

354
00:13:57.907 --> 00:13:59.677
You will have to come up with new names today.

355
00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:03.708
Team Senior and Team Junior.

356
00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.647
Jae Seok debuted before Seok Jin.

357
00:14:05.877 --> 00:14:07.017
That's right.

358
00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:08.188
Team Junior Jee.

359
00:14:08.387 --> 00:14:10.718
Team Senior Yu and Team Junior Jee.

360
00:14:10.787 --> 00:14:13.718
If you don't do well today, you will get a scolding.

361
00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:16.057
A scolding? Hey.

362
00:14:16.157 --> 00:14:18.127
It's natural for a junior to get a scolding from the senior.

363
00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.757
- Jae Seok is your senior. - He is a senior comedian.

364
00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:24.297
I will get you one day, you punk.

365
00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:25.698
Hold me back.

366
00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:27.098
- What? - Hold me back.

367
00:14:27.098 --> 00:14:29.167
I know you won't do anything to begin with.

368
00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:30.907
We will go with Team Senior Yu,

369
00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:33.078
- and Team Junior Jee. - So it's Team Junior.

370
00:14:33.108 --> 00:14:36.277
After Team Senior Yu and Team Junior Jee change,

371
00:14:36.277 --> 00:14:38.748
- the race will begin. - Is this really happening?

372
00:14:39.348 --> 00:14:40.618
Is this really happening?

373
00:14:40.618 --> 00:14:42.017
It's okay. We will win. Let's win.

374
00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:43.517
Let's show them what we can do.

375
00:14:44.358 --> 00:14:45.917
I don't belong in this team.

376
00:14:46.358 --> 00:14:48.157
I have a different color.

377
00:14:48.157 --> 00:14:49.688
- Stop it. - Hey.

378
00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:52.257
- I don't belong in this team. - You represent this team.

379
00:14:52.257 --> 00:14:54.598
- You lowered the team's quality. - We are like oil and water.

380
00:14:54.598 --> 00:14:55.968
- We don't belong together. - You represent this team.

381
00:14:55.968 --> 00:14:57.328
You lowered the team's quality.

382
00:14:57.328 --> 00:14:59.438
You lowered the team's quality.

383
00:14:59.667 --> 00:15:01.438
I don't belong in this team.

384
00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:07.637
(Team Senior Yu and Team Junior Jee)

385
00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.208
Jae Seok, let's go.

386
00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:12.818
- Are we taking the car? - We have the fighting spirits.

387
00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:16.188
Please take this before you go.

388
00:15:16.188 --> 00:15:17.218
Okay.

389
00:15:19.557 --> 00:15:23.257
(Why is there a roulette?)

390
00:15:23.787 --> 00:15:26.458
- What is this? - Before you go,

391
00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.228
you see "eliminating the name tag of the target", right?

392
00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:32.198
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

393
00:15:32.198 --> 00:15:33.968
For this, you eliminate the name tag...

394
00:15:33.968 --> 00:15:35.507
of the chosen member in the opposing team.

395
00:15:35.507 --> 00:15:37.807
(Eliminate the name tag of the chosen member.)

396
00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:40.608
You will choose the member before you go.

397
00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:41.907
So that the other team doesn't see the result,

398
00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.877
- spin the roulette at your spot. - Let's avoid Jong Kook.

399
00:15:43.877 --> 00:15:45.448
Let's avoid Jong Kook.

400
00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:48.118
It will be easy to dominate the race.

401
00:15:48.118 --> 00:15:50.417
- Our team... - Let's spin the roulette.

402
00:15:50.488 --> 00:15:52.218
It doesn't matter which member we get.

403
00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:53.488
I hope we get Seok Jin.

404
00:15:53.488 --> 00:15:55.757
Seok Jin will be the best choice.

405
00:15:56.057 --> 00:15:57.698
- Say, "Start." - Start.

406
00:15:58.598 --> 00:15:59.897
It's only right that you spin the roulette.

407
00:16:00.297 --> 00:16:01.297
My goodness.

408
00:16:01.698 --> 00:16:03.068
It's only right that you spin the roulette.

409
00:16:03.427 --> 00:16:04.637
My goodness.

410
00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:08.267
- My goodness. - My goodness.

411
00:16:08.838 --> 00:16:10.267
- This is fun. - It's game over.

412
00:16:10.267 --> 00:16:12.078
- This is great. - This is fun.

413
00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.277
Let's stick together today.

414
00:16:14.578 --> 00:16:16.647
- We have to do this. - We have to win.

415
00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:19.517
It will be too boring if we lose.

416
00:16:19.517 --> 00:16:21.618
We have to win.

417
00:16:21.618 --> 00:16:24.358
We will win today.

418
00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.057
I am sorry. I will be serious today.

419
00:16:26.057 --> 00:16:27.618
I am sorry. I won't be funny today.

420
00:16:27.618 --> 00:16:29.927
- I am sorry. - Don't expect us to joke around.

421
00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:31.627
- We will win today. - Dear viewers,

422
00:16:31.828 --> 00:16:33.157
don't laugh for an hour.

423
00:16:33.757 --> 00:16:34.927
Watch the show with seriousness.

424
00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.127
Watch the race...

425
00:16:37.127 --> 00:16:39.338
as if you are watching the Olympic Games. We are serious.

426
00:16:39.338 --> 00:16:41.208
We will be fine as long as you do well.

427
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.438
This is Pyeongchang Olympics.

428
00:16:42.507 --> 00:16:43.667
We can spin the roulette now, right?

429
00:16:43.667 --> 00:16:46.478
- Pick a member. - Spin the roulette.

430
00:16:47.537 --> 00:16:49.307
- Say, "Start." - It's a practice round.

431
00:16:49.677 --> 00:16:50.978
Spin it for practice.

432
00:16:51.147 --> 00:16:52.448
- Spin it for practice. - It's a practice round.

433
00:16:52.448 --> 00:16:53.777
It's nothing.

434
00:16:53.777 --> 00:16:55.688
- Okay! So Min! - So Min! We did it.

435
00:16:57.147 --> 00:16:59.358
(They give a ceremony after seeing they picked So Min.)

436
00:16:59.358 --> 00:17:01.188
- For goodness' sake. - All right.

437
00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:03.057
The four of you must shout, "Start."

438
00:17:03.057 --> 00:17:05.057
- We did that. - No, you didn't.

439
00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.228
We did that.

440
00:17:06.857 --> 00:17:08.628
Okay, okay.

441
00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:10.498
Okay. Spin the roulette.

442
00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:11.867
In 2, 3.

443
00:17:11.867 --> 00:17:14.638
- Why would you spin it? - It's a practice round.

444
00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.837
- Why would you spin it? - It's a practice round.

445
00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:18.138
It's a practice round.

446
00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:19.378
So Min!

447
00:17:19.378 --> 00:17:22.148
(They get So Min again.)

448
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.547
No.

449
00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:27.117
(They make the ceremony look more natural.)

450
00:17:27.117 --> 00:17:28.847
Let's go.

451
00:17:28.988 --> 00:17:30.017
Come on.

452
00:17:30.017 --> 00:17:31.488
- Say, "Start." - Let's go.

453
00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:32.688
- Start. - Start.

454
00:17:33.158 --> 00:17:35.158
- Here I go. - Let's spin it together.

455
00:17:35.158 --> 00:17:36.587
In 1, 2, 3.

456
00:17:36.587 --> 00:17:39.628
(After Ji Hyo shouts, "Start," they spin the roulette for real.)

457
00:17:40.857 --> 00:17:45.767
(Please let it be So Min again.)

458
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:51.791
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] SBS E389 Running Man "Bingo to the Flowery Road"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

459
00:17:52.178 --> 00:17:54.607
(They get Jong Kook.)

460
00:17:56.478 --> 00:17:57.878
We have to shout, "Start," together.

461
00:17:57.878 --> 00:17:59.678
- You picked Jong Kook. - No, no.

462
00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:00.948
- Come on. - One person should spin it.

463
00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:04.017
Actually, my finger wasn't on the roulette.

464
00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:06.257
- Who said, "Start"? - You picked Jong Kook.

465
00:18:06.257 --> 00:18:09.087
Kwang Soo, you should have kept your unlucky finger off of it.

466
00:18:10.787 --> 00:18:11.998
Where should we go first?

467
00:18:12.228 --> 00:18:14.327
- Camellia will be pretty. - Let's go to Camellia Hill.

468
00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:15.827
- I want to go there. - We will go to Camellia Hill.

469
00:18:16.498 --> 00:18:18.138
- I love camellia. - Camellia Hill.

470
00:18:19.138 --> 00:18:21.267
- Let's go and eat black cattle. - Black cattle?

471
00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:23.537
- How about black cattle? - I want to eat meat noodles.

472
00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:26.077
Aren't we eating black cattle?

473
00:18:26.077 --> 00:18:28.547
- Did you think we would raise them? - We'd be eating it?

474
00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.507
- We are only here for two days. - Hold on.

475
00:18:30.507 --> 00:18:32.047
I get that you are annoyed,

476
00:18:32.047 --> 00:18:33.918
- but don't snap at me. - Think about it.

477
00:18:33.978 --> 00:18:35.547
We are in this together.

478
00:18:35.787 --> 00:18:37.787
I don't belong in this team.

479
00:18:37.787 --> 00:18:40.057
You belong in this team more than I do.

480
00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:41.928
- I don't belong here. - We won't raise the black cattle.

481
00:18:41.928 --> 00:18:44.158
If they were red, I am yellow. I don't belong in this team.

482
00:18:44.158 --> 00:18:46.297
- Hey. - For goodness' sake.

483
00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:48.698
- You are taking forever. - Seriously.

484
00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:50.228
We are going to eat meat noodles.

485
00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:52.797
What's taking you so long? Hurry up.

486
00:18:52.797 --> 00:18:55.208
- We are set. - We just don't have the teamwork.

487
00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:56.767
Gosh, they are so annoying.

488
00:18:56.767 --> 00:18:58.837
- Let's eat black cattle. - Let's do that.

489
00:18:59.537 --> 00:19:03.347
Did the roulette point at my name?

490
00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:07.577
Go, and do it.

491
00:19:07.577 --> 00:19:08.718
- Stop the car. - Do it.

492
00:19:08.718 --> 00:19:10.648
Hurry up, and run.

493
00:19:11.488 --> 00:19:12.557
Run.

494
00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:14.317
- That's right. - Haha.

495
00:19:14.428 --> 00:19:15.958
What's wrong?

496
00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.257
- Start driving. - What is he doing?

497
00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:18.458
- Go. - Hey.

498
00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:20.128
I'm sorry.

499
00:19:20.128 --> 00:19:21.128
(Will Haha think that he's the target?)

500
00:19:21.128 --> 00:19:22.228
Was it me?

501
00:19:22.827 --> 00:19:25.297
- Is it me? - I don't think it's you.

502
00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:26.767
It's not you.

503
00:19:28.638 --> 00:19:29.638
Okay.

504
00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:31.337
It was enough to look suspicious.

505
00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:35.478
(Dark treasure of Jeju Island and arboretum)

506
00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.277
Let's get to the black cattle ranch first.

507
00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:38.817
- We're leaving. - Okay.

508
00:19:39.017 --> 00:19:41.388
What's our strategy?

509
00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:42.817
After eating,

510
00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:45.418
if we see the other team, we'll tear off his name tag.

511
00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:48.327
- Okay. - Finish at the mandarin trees.

512
00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:49.827
- That's one bingo. - Is that bingo?

513
00:19:49.827 --> 00:19:50.857
Listen.

514
00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.958
- The center is the most important. - The center?

515
00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.257
"Eliminating the name tag of the target".

516
00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:56.367
Why did we get Jong Kook?

517
00:19:56.527 --> 00:19:58.337
How could our target be Jong Kook?

518
00:19:58.668 --> 00:20:00.537
It was as if it were planned.

519
00:20:00.898 --> 00:20:02.507
Teams were arranged if it were planned.

520
00:20:02.908 --> 00:20:04.337
- Gosh. - How is it possible?

521
00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:06.638
- We should definitely win. - I agree.

522
00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:09.248
- We usually imagine the worst team. - Right.

523
00:20:09.248 --> 00:20:11.218
This is the worst team that I've never imagined.

524
00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.547
(It's the worst team ever.)

525
00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:14.787
Is it the worst?

526
00:20:15.087 --> 00:20:16.787
Who makes it the worst team?

527
00:20:19.488 --> 00:20:20.517
Don't ask.

528
00:20:20.557 --> 00:20:22.458
(You know the answer.)

529
00:20:22.628 --> 00:20:24.188
(Are you talking about me?)

530
00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:25.827
- Who do you think it is? - Pardon?

531
00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.198
Who makes this team the worst?

532
00:20:27.597 --> 00:20:29.597
I'll show you what I have.

533
00:20:29.827 --> 00:20:30.827
Get ready, everyone.

534
00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:35.337
This is great. It's perfect to drive in Jeju Island.

535
00:20:35.738 --> 00:20:37.468
- It's the best. - When there are no cameras...

536
00:20:37.537 --> 00:20:38.978
(She looks around carefully.)

537
00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:41.908
This is great.

538
00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:43.708
It feels...

539
00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:46.317
like...

540
00:20:46.317 --> 00:20:47.718
(She hesitates.)

541
00:20:47.718 --> 00:20:50.517
It's my first time being on a team with people...

542
00:20:50.517 --> 00:20:51.757
who aren't weaker than me.

543
00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.357
Se Chan and Kwang Soo...

544
00:20:56.357 --> 00:20:58.428
are around my age.

545
00:20:58.428 --> 00:20:59.728
- That's true. - I feel comfortable with them.

546
00:20:59.728 --> 00:21:01.468
I think Seok Jin is...

547
00:21:01.567 --> 00:21:02.928
He's quite weak.

548
00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.867
- I don't have to be careful... - He's weak.

549
00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:05.998
Around Seok Jin.

550
00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:07.067
Seok Jin is weak.

551
00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:09.607
It's my first time being around my seniors.

552
00:21:09.607 --> 00:21:10.837
Seok Jin doesn't count.

553
00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.307
So Min, have you been to Jeju Island often?

554
00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:15.448
- Jeju Island? - Yes.

555
00:21:15.448 --> 00:21:16.807
I used to live here.

556
00:21:16.807 --> 00:21:18.718
- When? - It was when I was six.

557
00:21:18.718 --> 00:21:20.017
- Really? - I lived for about a year.

558
00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:22.047
- Really? - It was due to my dad's work.

559
00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.918
- Did your father work here? - Yes.

560
00:21:23.918 --> 00:21:25.658
Did he work in Jeju Island?

561
00:21:25.658 --> 00:21:28.128
During his stay here,

562
00:21:29.057 --> 00:21:32.728
while he peed in the ocean in Jeju Island,

563
00:21:33.857 --> 00:21:37.128
- he caught an octopus. - Really?

564
00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:38.597
- How did he? - As he peed,

565
00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:39.767
the water turned warm.

566
00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:41.507
An octopus came up from underneath the rocks.

567
00:21:41.908 --> 00:21:43.738
Your stories...

568
00:21:43.738 --> 00:21:46.007
including about your father are strange.

569
00:21:46.277 --> 00:21:47.708
- They're unbelievable. - They're strange.

570
00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:49.948
- I agree. - You tell unbelievable stories.

571
00:21:49.948 --> 00:21:53.347
It was my first time eating octopus that was freshly caught.

572
00:21:53.347 --> 00:21:55.547
- Really? - It was an octopus that...

573
00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:57.388
- your father caught with his urine. - Yes.

574
00:21:57.517 --> 00:21:58.718
It was surprised by the warmth.

575
00:21:58.718 --> 00:21:59.757
- So Min. - Yes?

576
00:21:59.757 --> 00:22:01.128
Do you have memories in Jeju Island?

577
00:22:01.128 --> 00:22:02.128
Let me think.

578
00:22:02.128 --> 00:22:03.527
Have you come here with a boyfriend?

579
00:22:03.527 --> 00:22:04.557
I have.

580
00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:06.797
- Have you? - Yes.

581
00:22:07.428 --> 00:22:08.797
Jeju Island.

582
00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:10.428
Did you come here alone with him?

583
00:22:10.827 --> 00:22:13.168
Just us two.

584
00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:16.638
You sound nostalgic.

585
00:22:16.638 --> 00:22:18.077
- "Just us two." - "Just us two."

586
00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:19.938
- The woman... - However

587
00:22:20.577 --> 00:22:22.748
that I loved the most got married.

588
00:22:23.577 --> 00:22:24.678
That's great news.

589
00:22:24.678 --> 00:22:27.478
(Jae Seok makes him feel worse.)

590
00:22:28.388 --> 00:22:29.488
- I think... - Seriously?

591
00:22:29.488 --> 00:22:30.847
It's great for her.

592
00:22:30.847 --> 00:22:32.658
How dare you say that?

593
00:22:32.658 --> 00:22:34.158
- Get out! - What's wrong?

594
00:22:34.158 --> 00:22:35.327
- How could you? - What is it?

595
00:22:35.327 --> 00:22:37.857
Don't ruin my beautiful memory.

596
00:22:38.327 --> 00:22:40.728
- Gosh. - You probably gave her a hard time.

597
00:22:40.728 --> 00:22:41.767
My goodness.

598
00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:43.597
(Here they go again.)

599
00:22:43.597 --> 00:22:44.898
But listen.

600
00:22:44.898 --> 00:22:46.837
Just don't say anything.

601
00:22:46.837 --> 00:22:49.367
Don't say anything after saying but.

602
00:22:49.507 --> 00:22:51.537
- Stop it. - I'm getting...

603
00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:54.138
- upset little by little. - The water looks great.

604
00:22:54.138 --> 00:22:57.507
- Let's just win today. - Goodness.

605
00:22:57.507 --> 00:22:58.878
This is great.

606
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:00.748
- It's great. - Isn't it?

607
00:23:01.148 --> 00:23:02.488
We're here.

608
00:23:02.488 --> 00:23:04.488
(While they argue, they arrive at Camellia Hill.)

609
00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:07.057
- Camellias bloom in the winter. - It's so windy.

610
00:23:07.357 --> 00:23:09.928
- A song is called "Camellia Lady". - "Camellia Lady".

611
00:23:09.928 --> 00:23:13.757
- Countless numbers of - "Camellia Lady".

612
00:23:13.857 --> 00:23:17.067
- Nights - Nights

613
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:20.468
I'm thankful Jong Kook is a singer.

614
00:23:20.468 --> 00:23:23.208
If not, his voice sounds so weak.

615
00:23:25.607 --> 00:23:29.277
Are you trying to pick a fight?

616
00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:30.408
Jong Kook is a singer.

617
00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:31.847
- What do you mean? - Seriously.

618
00:23:31.878 --> 00:23:33.448
- Jae Seok. - What did I say?

619
00:23:33.448 --> 00:23:35.347
- He's trying to pick a fight. - It's just my opinion.

620
00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:37.418
- Mr. Yu. - What is it?

621
00:23:37.418 --> 00:23:39.218
We're having a good time today.

622
00:23:39.218 --> 00:23:40.388
Wasn't that an attack?

623
00:23:40.388 --> 00:23:43.027
What do you mean? I was only speaking my mind.

624
00:23:43.027 --> 00:23:44.327
- What's wrong with that? - Gosh.

625
00:23:44.327 --> 00:23:45.998
Don't make it uncomfortable, and get out of the car.

626
00:23:45.998 --> 00:23:47.097
He's strange.

627
00:23:47.097 --> 00:23:48.128
- Let's get out first. - Do I take this with me?

628
00:23:48.128 --> 00:23:49.367
(They don't stop arguing.)

629
00:23:51.168 --> 00:23:52.537
- It's so windy. - Where do we go?

630
00:23:52.938 --> 00:23:55.007
- The wind is warm. - It's warm.

631
00:23:55.007 --> 00:23:56.107
It's warm today.

632
00:23:57.537 --> 00:23:58.738
- There's sunlight. - The weather is...

633
00:23:58.878 --> 00:24:00.107
- great today. - There's sunlight.

634
00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:01.978
- I know. - Where are the camellias?

635
00:24:01.978 --> 00:24:03.448
- Let's go. - Where are they?

636
00:24:03.448 --> 00:24:04.577
(The best Camellia Hill in Asia)

637
00:24:04.577 --> 00:24:05.617
This is amazing.

638
00:24:05.948 --> 00:24:07.988
I didn't know there was a place like this.

639
00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:09.547
- There are many new places here. - It's not cold.

640
00:24:09.547 --> 00:24:12.587
- Are camellia flowers red or white? - They're red.

641
00:24:12.587 --> 00:24:15.388
(With various camellia flowers from the world, it changes with seasons.)

642
00:24:16.728 --> 00:24:19.658
(At this beautiful arboretum...)

643
00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:20.698
What's that?

644
00:24:20.698 --> 00:24:22.297
- It's Tray Karaoke. - It's Tray Karaoke.

645
00:24:22.297 --> 00:24:23.597
- It is. - It's Tray Karaoke.

646
00:24:23.597 --> 00:24:25.668
Gosh, it's Tray Karaoke.

647
00:24:25.938 --> 00:24:27.097
Tray Karaoke?

648
00:24:28.037 --> 00:24:29.307
(She's excited alone.)

649
00:24:29.837 --> 00:24:31.537
Look at these camellia flowers.

650
00:24:31.878 --> 00:24:33.878
- They're pretty. - They're pretty, So Min.

651
00:24:33.878 --> 00:24:35.547
- Are these camellia flowers? - I see.

652
00:24:35.547 --> 00:24:38.478
- I can't find where you are. - Jong Kook.

653
00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:40.948
(Jong Kook makes So Min's heart flutter.)

654
00:24:40.948 --> 00:24:41.988
Indeed.

655
00:24:42.218 --> 00:24:44.958
I see you very clearly, So Min.

656
00:24:45.117 --> 00:24:46.488
I see you clearly.

657
00:24:46.587 --> 00:24:48.557
- Move. Don't hurt the flowers. - Hey.

658
00:24:48.557 --> 00:24:49.857
So Min is a camellia.

659
00:24:49.857 --> 00:24:51.257
- I'm a camellia. - She was.

660
00:24:51.327 --> 00:24:52.327
Goodness.

661
00:24:52.327 --> 00:24:54.628
- You're at the first destination. - It's so beautiful here.

662
00:24:54.628 --> 00:24:56.498
I was worried being in the car with Jong Kook,

663
00:24:56.498 --> 00:24:58.067
but we didn't argue so much.

664
00:24:58.638 --> 00:25:01.208
- That's not it. - The way he drives is so different.

665
00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:03.168
He wanted to pick a fight...

666
00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.708
- No, his driving... - during the ride.

667
00:25:04.708 --> 00:25:05.777
Made me want to fight.

668
00:25:05.777 --> 00:25:07.748
- When we're in a big group... - They were close to arguing.

669
00:25:07.748 --> 00:25:09.748
Jae Seok knows how to agitate people.

670
00:25:09.748 --> 00:25:10.777
Sorry?

671
00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:12.517
That jerk.

672
00:25:12.517 --> 00:25:14.488
- Jae Seok is... - Let's sit down.

673
00:25:14.488 --> 00:25:15.517
What do we do?

674
00:25:15.517 --> 00:25:17.087
Your mission is called...

675
00:25:17.648 --> 00:25:19.617
Camellia Flower Tray Karaoke.

676
00:25:19.617 --> 00:25:22.527
(Camellia Flower Tray Karaoke)

677
00:25:22.658 --> 00:25:24.658
You get five chances.

678
00:25:24.658 --> 00:25:27.128
Sing "Camellia Lady" without making any mistakes.

679
00:25:27.128 --> 00:25:29.468
(You must sing "Camellia Lady" without any mistakes to succeed.)

680
00:25:29.468 --> 00:25:30.728
Then, you clear the mission.

681
00:25:31.267 --> 00:25:33.498
If you make a mistake, the tray falls on you.

682
00:25:33.597 --> 00:25:34.807
I know.

683
00:25:36.007 --> 00:25:42.178
(This is a song by Lee Mi Ja, a famous Korean singer.)

684
00:25:43.607 --> 00:25:45.617
Aren't you familiar with "Camellia Lady"?

685
00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:48.688
You'll sing verse two.

686
00:25:48.918 --> 00:25:49.918
Verse two?

687
00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:52.958
- Wait a minute. - That's too harsh.

688
00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:54.357
(Does anyone know the second verse?)

689
00:25:54.357 --> 00:25:56.257
- You're really terrible. - Is this...

690
00:25:57.057 --> 00:25:58.498
I hardly know the lyrics.

691
00:25:59.228 --> 00:26:00.398
The three Chance Cards are...

692
00:26:00.398 --> 00:26:02.767
listen to the whole song, listen to one measure, and changing seats.

693
00:26:02.767 --> 00:26:04.698
You get two chances to use them.

694
00:26:05.067 --> 00:26:06.297
Let's start right away.

695
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.807
You'll pick seats after listening.

696
00:26:07.807 --> 00:26:08.807
Goodness.

697
00:26:09.638 --> 00:26:11.577
Play the song.

698
00:26:11.577 --> 00:26:15.408
(The main song plays.)

699
00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:18.378
(Try to memorize the lyrics with them.)

700
00:26:18.418 --> 00:26:22.617
The story engraved on.

701
00:26:22.718 --> 00:26:26.718
Camellia petals.

702
00:26:27.158 --> 00:26:30.888
With the secret story.

703
00:26:31.128 --> 00:26:33.698
In her heart.

704
00:26:34.597 --> 00:26:37.567
Camellia Lady.

705
00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:38.567
(She murmurs to herself.)

706
00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:41.767
Is.

707
00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:49.708
Waiting.

708
00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:57.488
When will her love come back

709
00:26:57.587 --> 00:26:58.757
I don't know this song.

710
00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:06.198
(This part is sung by the whole group.)

711
00:27:06.198 --> 00:27:12.468
(This part is sung by the whole group.)

712
00:27:12.468 --> 00:27:14.097
- I'm in trouble. - To the lonely camellia flower?

713
00:27:14.238 --> 00:27:15.968
- "Camellia Lady is waiting". - My part is...

714
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:16.968
(It's difficult.)

715
00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:19.208
- I'm in trouble. - You may not discuss.

716
00:27:19.577 --> 00:27:21.507
- Pick a number. - Goodness.

717
00:27:21.507 --> 00:27:22.908
I need number three.

718
00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:24.277
"Camellia Lady is waiting".

719
00:27:24.277 --> 00:27:25.847
- "Camellia Lady waits"? - "Waiting".

720
00:27:25.847 --> 00:27:27.347
- "Waiting". - You may not discuss.

721
00:27:27.418 --> 00:27:28.547
We can't discuss?

722
00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:29.688
You may not discuss.

723
00:27:30.047 --> 00:27:31.587
- I need to pick number three. - What?

724
00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:32.958
The story engraved on.

725
00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:34.017
You may not discuss.

726
00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:35.087
I'm number four.

727
00:27:35.128 --> 00:27:37.557
(Jae Seok picks his original seat.)

728
00:27:37.557 --> 00:27:38.557
- What's your number? - Number one.

729
00:27:38.557 --> 00:27:39.628
That's a relief.

730
00:27:39.628 --> 00:27:41.067
(Haha and So Min pick their original seats.)

731
00:27:41.228 --> 00:27:42.267
(Everyone picks their original seats.)

732
00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:43.327
Wait, do it again.

733
00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:44.537
- We didn't cheat. - We didn't.

734
00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:45.837
- No way. - We didn't cheat.

735
00:27:45.837 --> 00:27:47.297
- We didn't cheat. - We didn't do anything.

736
00:27:47.297 --> 00:27:48.307
No way.

737
00:27:48.307 --> 00:27:49.367
- We swear. - We didn't do anything.

738
00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.577
- I got goosebumps. - This is unbelievable.

739
00:27:51.938 --> 00:27:53.577
- We got the same result. - I can't remember anyway.

740
00:27:53.577 --> 00:27:54.577
- We only have four. - I don't...

741
00:27:54.577 --> 00:27:55.908
I don't know the melody.

742
00:27:56.178 --> 00:27:57.507
Let's play for now.

743
00:27:57.507 --> 00:27:58.918
(They sit in their original seats.)

744
00:27:58.918 --> 00:28:01.918
If you discuss, you'll have to pick another number.

745
00:28:01.918 --> 00:28:02.988
(It's their first attempt.)

746
00:28:03.287 --> 00:28:04.317
Gosh.

747
00:28:04.317 --> 00:28:05.357
(How will it turn out?)

748
00:28:05.357 --> 00:28:06.787
Please play the sound.

749
00:28:07.757 --> 00:28:09.757
Music starts.

750
00:28:09.757 --> 00:28:12.097
(It's their first try.)

751
00:28:12.097 --> 00:28:17.698
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

752
00:28:17.698 --> 00:28:19.767
The story.

753
00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:21.208
What is he doing?

754
00:28:21.668 --> 00:28:23.738
(The tray comes down.)

755
00:28:23.738 --> 00:28:25.507
Haha, how could you?

756
00:28:25.507 --> 00:28:26.678
- The story - What?

757
00:28:26.678 --> 00:28:28.208
What was that melody?

758
00:28:28.547 --> 00:28:31.448
- I don't know the song. - What are your lyrics?

759
00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:33.918
- It hurt. - "The story engraved on".

760
00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:38.257
The story engraved on.

761
00:28:38.257 --> 00:28:40.857
Camellias.

762
00:28:40.857 --> 00:28:42.688
Isn't it "The story engraved on camellia petals"?

763
00:28:42.688 --> 00:28:44.597
- I think so. - Isn't it camellia petals?

764
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:48.097
- With - With the secret story.

765
00:28:48.097 --> 00:28:50.767
In her heart.

766
00:28:51.037 --> 00:28:53.337
Camellia Lady.

767
00:28:53.337 --> 00:28:54.408
- You're terrible at singing. - Is.

768
00:28:54.408 --> 00:28:55.738
- Waiting - So Min.

769
00:28:55.738 --> 00:28:57.638
Can you sing with emotions?

770
00:28:57.638 --> 00:29:03.148
- Camellia Lady - Camellia Lady.

771
00:29:03.878 --> 00:29:05.277
What was the last line?

772
00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:06.777
(What was my part?)

773
00:29:06.777 --> 00:29:07.948
- What? - It went...

774
00:29:07.948 --> 00:29:09.648
(Are you serious?)

775
00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:12.188
It went, "Wherever" or something like that.

776
00:29:12.458 --> 00:29:14.428
"Or something like that"?

777
00:29:14.688 --> 00:29:17.128
- What did you hear? - Seriously,

778
00:29:17.287 --> 00:29:19.198
you should have at least heard a phrase.

779
00:29:19.198 --> 00:29:20.797
- Seriously... - Hold on.

780
00:29:21.097 --> 00:29:23.567
Are there teams within this team?

781
00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:25.668
- It's not like that. - It's not like that.

782
00:29:25.668 --> 00:29:28.307
- We're all in this. - We all aim to succeed.

783
00:29:28.307 --> 00:29:30.007
- So Min, come here. - Jae Seok.

784
00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:32.378
- Jae Seok. - Hey.

785
00:29:32.378 --> 00:29:33.638
Choose the right team.

786
00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:37.178
- Choose the right team. - He should know at least a little.

787
00:29:37.178 --> 00:29:39.047
- So Min, are you sure? - Seriously...

788
00:29:39.047 --> 00:29:41.388
- You should've heard something. - You should have.

789
00:29:41.388 --> 00:29:42.888
The thing is,

790
00:29:42.888 --> 00:29:44.888
I was flustered. I was listening to the beginning part.

791
00:29:44.888 --> 00:29:46.988
Do you want to sleep on the ice rink tonight?

792
00:29:46.988 --> 00:29:48.958
Sing the beginning part then.

793
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:50.958
- What? Hold on. - Sing the beginning part.

794
00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:53.797
- What is he saying? - Sing the beginning part.

795
00:29:53.797 --> 00:29:55.728
If it's correct, I'll let it slide.

796
00:29:56.428 --> 00:29:59.168
I'm sorry.

797
00:29:59.168 --> 00:30:01.168
(I sincerely apologize.)

798
00:30:01.168 --> 00:30:03.438
- I'm sorry. - You should have apologized.

799
00:30:03.438 --> 00:30:06.077
- The thing is... - Stop giving excuses.

800
00:30:06.378 --> 00:30:09.208
You can either hear the whole song, hear one line, or switch places.

801
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.208
- Okay. - Let's do this.

802
00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:11.448
You can use only two Chance Cards.

803
00:30:11.448 --> 00:30:12.678
Why are you picking one yourself?

804
00:30:12.678 --> 00:30:13.978
- Did you pick one? - It'll be the whole song.

805
00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:16.988
(He's confident in his choice.)

806
00:30:17.958 --> 00:30:19.857
- You're unlucky. - Hey!

807
00:30:21.688 --> 00:30:22.688
Why did you do it?

808
00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:23.827
(They have only 2 chances, )

809
00:30:23.827 --> 00:30:25.228
(and Jae Seok picked "switching places".)

810
00:30:25.228 --> 00:30:27.027
- I shouldn't have done it. - Why did you do it on your own?

811
00:30:27.027 --> 00:30:29.067
My team...

812
00:30:29.067 --> 00:30:31.198
No. You already picked one.

813
00:30:31.438 --> 00:30:33.198
I can't believe you.

814
00:30:33.567 --> 00:30:37.067
- But I... - He didn't even hear his line.

815
00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.337
We're Team Senior Yu.

816
00:30:39.478 --> 00:30:41.807
Our team was named after me.

817
00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:45.047
That's just the team's name, nothing more.

818
00:30:45.047 --> 00:30:47.117
- Aren't you going to say something? - We named the team after you,

819
00:30:47.117 --> 00:30:48.847
- so pull yourself together. - Jae Seok.

820
00:30:49.488 --> 00:30:51.117
- Pull yourself together, will you? - Gosh.

821
00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:53.317
- Are you serious? - Why did you do it on your own?

822
00:30:53.317 --> 00:30:54.958
My goodness.

823
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:57.488
- Let's try. - Gosh.

824
00:30:57.587 --> 00:30:59.428
- "The story"... - "On camellia petals"...

825
00:30:59.428 --> 00:31:00.827
- "Engraved on camellia petals". - "Engraved on camellia petals".

826
00:31:01.168 --> 00:31:06.267
- Love engraved on camellia petals - The story engraved on.

827
00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:07.267
It's "the story".

828
00:31:08.968 --> 00:31:11.307
It sounded like, "the story".

829
00:31:11.307 --> 00:31:12.537
It doesn't suit the melody.

830
00:31:13.277 --> 00:31:14.678
(The story engraved)

831
00:31:14.678 --> 00:31:18.017
You sound so sly.

832
00:31:18.017 --> 00:31:20.148
He's great.

833
00:31:20.218 --> 00:31:22.188
- Sly? - He's amazing.

834
00:31:22.188 --> 00:31:23.817
- You sound so sly. - Sly?

835
00:31:23.817 --> 00:31:26.057
- You sound sly. - I sounded sly?

836
00:31:26.057 --> 00:31:27.287
I'm short.

837
00:31:27.688 --> 00:31:29.128
- I'm short. - You're short.

838
00:31:29.128 --> 00:31:30.757
- Jong Kook is sly. - Sly?

839
00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:31.928
I'm embarrassing.

840
00:31:32.728 --> 00:31:33.797
Exactly.

841
00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:36.168
- How did you know? - Let's draw a number.

842
00:31:36.168 --> 00:31:37.168
(Let's switch places.)

843
00:31:37.168 --> 00:31:40.367
- What was it? - The story.

844
00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:42.668
- We're in trouble. - I'm number one.

845
00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:46.908
- The story - Stop discussing.

846
00:31:47.208 --> 00:31:48.248
- MR. - The story on.

847
00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:50.878
- That must be it. - "Engraved on".

848
00:31:50.878 --> 00:31:52.448
- "The story on"... - Play.

849
00:31:52.448 --> 00:31:54.277
- The story on - Play the music.

850
00:31:54.388 --> 00:31:56.688
(They can't even agree on the first line.)

851
00:31:56.688 --> 00:31:58.817
(Will their second try be successful?)

852
00:31:59.188 --> 00:32:01.587
(Second try)

853
00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:05.357
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

854
00:32:05.357 --> 00:32:09.468
The story.

855
00:32:09.468 --> 00:32:11.567
On camellia petals.

856
00:32:11.567 --> 00:32:13.638
- It's "engraved on". - It's "engraved on".

857
00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:16.007
(Jong Kook told you.)

858
00:32:16.007 --> 00:32:18.607
- It's "engraved on". - He deserves a beating.

859
00:32:19.307 --> 00:32:21.077
You deserve a beating.

860
00:32:21.847 --> 00:32:22.878
Come here.

861
00:32:23.478 --> 00:32:24.678
Get up.

862
00:32:24.678 --> 00:32:26.218
We're Team Senior Yu.

863
00:32:26.218 --> 00:32:28.388
- We're Team Senior Yu. - I didn't know my part.

864
00:32:28.388 --> 00:32:30.817
When you've done something wrong, you should be criticized.

865
00:32:30.847 --> 00:32:33.817
You should learn to take criticism.

866
00:32:33.958 --> 00:32:36.027
Draw a Chance Card.

867
00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:38.198
Draw one. Let Jong Kook do it.

868
00:32:38.198 --> 00:32:39.257
Look.

869
00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:41.468
(Let Jong Kook do it this time.)

870
00:32:42.468 --> 00:32:48.638
(If he draws something bad, he'll feel bad.)

871
00:32:49.107 --> 00:32:51.378
Look. I'll show you.

872
00:32:51.378 --> 00:32:54.777
(I'll show you all.)

873
00:32:55.178 --> 00:32:58.918
(Will it go as Jae Seok planned?)

874
00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:02.287
Look. It's the whole song, see?

875
00:33:02.888 --> 00:33:03.888
Go away.

876
00:33:04.488 --> 00:33:07.287
Why can't you do this? Do you see this?

877
00:33:08.388 --> 00:33:09.388
Apologize.

878
00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:11.698
- Why? - Kiss his hand.

879
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:13.228
Kiss his hand.

880
00:33:13.928 --> 00:33:15.267
Kiss his hand.

881
00:33:15.797 --> 00:33:16.928
Gosh.

882
00:33:17.168 --> 00:33:18.998
- Hey. - Focus.

883
00:33:18.998 --> 00:33:20.968
Focus. Let's hear the whole song again.

884
00:33:20.968 --> 00:33:21.968
Okay.

885
00:33:21.968 --> 00:33:23.168
- Gosh. - Good job.

886
00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.708
Listen to others' parts too. I don't know my part.

887
00:33:26.007 --> 00:33:29.478
All right. Play the music.

888
00:33:29.478 --> 00:33:33.648
(As their last chance, they hear the whole song again.)

889
00:33:36.388 --> 00:33:41.988
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

890
00:33:41.988 --> 00:33:43.988
(It's "engraved on".)

891
00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:45.228
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

892
00:33:46.097 --> 00:33:47.097
(With the secret story in her heart)

893
00:33:47.097 --> 00:33:52.567
(Listening carefully)

894
00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:53.567
It's "in her heart".

895
00:33:53.567 --> 00:33:56.267
(Camellia Lady is waiting)

896
00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:57.567
"Camellia Lady is"...

897
00:33:57.567 --> 00:34:03.908
(Camellia Lady is waiting)

898
00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:05.077
(Nodding)

899
00:34:05.077 --> 00:34:07.378
(Camellia Lady is waiting)

900
00:34:09.487 --> 00:34:16.327
(When will her love come back)

901
00:34:16.327 --> 00:34:17.487
What did she sing?

902
00:34:18.298 --> 00:34:25.367
(To the lonely camellia flower?)

903
00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:31.008
(To the lonely camellia flower?)

904
00:34:31.008 --> 00:34:32.608
All right. It's "To the lonely camellia flower".

905
00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:35.108
- I didn't hear my part. - Let's start right away.

906
00:34:35.478 --> 00:34:37.677
- "When will"... - "To the lonely"...

907
00:34:37.818 --> 00:34:39.677
- "To the lonely"... - What should I do?

908
00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:42.048
- To the lonely... - Play...

909
00:34:42.048 --> 00:34:44.387
- the music. - What was my part? The story...

910
00:34:44.387 --> 00:34:45.458
The story...

911
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:46.557
(Third try)

912
00:34:46.557 --> 00:34:49.028
- The story - "Engraved on"...

913
00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:50.387
"Camellia petals".

914
00:34:50.657 --> 00:34:56.298
The story on camellia petals.

915
00:34:56.298 --> 00:34:57.298
It's "engraved on".

916
00:34:57.367 --> 00:34:59.367
(He's wrong again.)

917
00:34:59.367 --> 00:35:00.367
(Engraved!)

918
00:35:00.367 --> 00:35:02.467
"Engraved", you idiot!

919
00:35:03.807 --> 00:35:04.838
Let me engrave your body.

920
00:35:06.378 --> 00:35:08.648
I can't believe you guys.

921
00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:10.978
- How many times did I tell you? - Jae Seok!

922
00:35:11.048 --> 00:35:12.978
Guys, say something.

923
00:35:12.978 --> 00:35:15.048
How could you do this?

924
00:35:15.048 --> 00:35:17.958
What are you doing?

925
00:35:18.217 --> 00:35:19.458
- It's "engraved"... - What are you?

926
00:35:19.858 --> 00:35:20.858
(Let me teach you a lesson.)

927
00:35:20.858 --> 00:35:22.557
What are you doing?

928
00:35:23.028 --> 00:35:24.927
- Hold on. - Let me take care of it.

929
00:35:24.927 --> 00:35:26.458
I'm sorry.

930
00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:27.827
I can't believe it.

931
00:35:27.827 --> 00:35:29.728
- That's enough. - Is he a spy?

932
00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:30.967
- Please ignore this one. - Are you a spy?

933
00:35:30.967 --> 00:35:32.767
- Apologize to everyone. - What?

934
00:35:32.838 --> 00:35:34.508
- What? - Apologize.

935
00:35:34.668 --> 00:35:35.907
Apologize.

936
00:35:35.907 --> 00:35:37.878
- I can't let it slide. - Hands on your belly.

937
00:35:37.878 --> 00:35:39.708
- Okay. - Hands on your belly.

938
00:35:40.907 --> 00:35:42.978
- Hands on your belly. - Hands on your belly.

939
00:35:42.978 --> 00:35:44.447
- I'm sorry. - There you go.

940
00:35:44.447 --> 00:35:45.847
- Good. - Do you remember my part?

941
00:35:45.847 --> 00:35:49.117
The story.

942
00:35:49.117 --> 00:35:51.287
- It's "engraved on". - Okay.

943
00:35:51.287 --> 00:35:52.287
Let's try singing the whole thing.

944
00:35:52.287 --> 00:35:56.228
Stop pointing your spoon at me.

945
00:35:56.557 --> 00:35:58.057
- I've had enough. - I'm sorry.

946
00:35:58.057 --> 00:36:01.427
If you sing it wrong again, I'll engrave your body.

947
00:36:02.028 --> 00:36:03.568
(Haha is practicing diligently.)

948
00:36:03.568 --> 00:36:06.838
I don't know my part. When will her.

949
00:36:07.267 --> 00:36:09.907
When will her love.

950
00:36:09.907 --> 00:36:12.077
It was your part before.

951
00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:14.478
- He didn't hear it. - I didn't hear that part.

952
00:36:14.478 --> 00:36:16.608
- Why? - I was busy listening to mine.

953
00:36:16.778 --> 00:36:18.748
I don't remember what I heard in the beginning.

954
00:36:19.378 --> 00:36:20.818
What?

955
00:36:20.818 --> 00:36:23.188
- Tell her something. - How could I remember it?

956
00:36:23.188 --> 00:36:24.918
- Can't you say anything? - When will her love...

957
00:36:24.918 --> 00:36:27.217
(I remember it now.)

958
00:36:27.217 --> 00:36:29.588
(When will her love come back)

959
00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:31.197
- Good. - Let's start.

960
00:36:31.197 --> 00:36:33.097
- Okay. - What was the last line?

961
00:36:33.097 --> 00:36:34.128
The last line.

962
00:36:34.128 --> 00:36:37.367
(To the lonely camellia flower?)

963
00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:38.998
The lonely camellia flower blooms.

964
00:36:38.998 --> 00:36:40.298
- What? - "To the lonely camellia flower".

965
00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:42.307
The lonely camellia flower blooms.

966
00:36:42.307 --> 00:36:45.008
- Isn't that a different song? - "To the lonely camellia flower".

967
00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:46.677
All three of them got up.

968
00:36:47.878 --> 00:36:49.548
To the lonely camellia flower?

969
00:36:49.548 --> 00:36:51.878
Fine. Stay in your seats.

970
00:36:51.947 --> 00:36:53.177
- We're here. - Okay.

971
00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:55.447
- I've never seen black cattle. - Neither have I.

972
00:36:56.117 --> 00:36:58.717
We're in Jeju Island. Is this Olle Trail?

973
00:36:59.387 --> 00:37:01.458
- Are we on Olle Trail? - I think so.

974
00:37:01.458 --> 00:37:03.728
No, this is not Olle Trail.

975
00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:05.628
It's somewhere else.

976
00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:07.697
Just agree with him.

977
00:37:07.867 --> 00:37:09.767
- I'm sorry. - I really don't like him.

978
00:37:09.767 --> 00:37:11.568
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

979
00:37:11.568 --> 00:37:13.637
You're number three.

980
00:37:14.037 --> 00:37:16.338
- Hey. - What's that?

981
00:37:17.708 --> 00:37:18.978
- What is this? - Is this all poop?

982
00:37:18.978 --> 00:37:20.108
- It's all poop. - Really?

983
00:37:20.108 --> 00:37:21.248
It's all poop.

984
00:37:21.278 --> 00:37:23.008
No. Oh, it is.

985
00:37:23.008 --> 00:37:24.008
It is.

986
00:37:24.918 --> 00:37:25.918
It's all poop?

987
00:37:26.048 --> 00:37:27.887
It's poop.

988
00:37:28.188 --> 00:37:29.847
I've never seen anything like this before.

989
00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:31.588
(Are you surprised?)

990
00:37:32.318 --> 00:37:33.918
The road is covered with poop.

991
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.858
- There's so much. - It's all poop.

992
00:37:35.858 --> 00:37:36.887
Gosh.

993
00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:37.898
(It's a poop trail.)

994
00:37:37.898 --> 00:37:40.197
(Come here.)

995
00:37:40.498 --> 00:37:45.298
(They're struggling to get poop on each other.)

996
00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:49.838
(They take hold of the team leader.)

997
00:37:49.838 --> 00:37:50.838
(He steps on it.)

998
00:37:50.838 --> 00:37:52.978
Seok Jin stepped on poop.

999
00:37:52.978 --> 00:37:56.447
(Look at Seok Jin. He stepped on poop.)

1000
00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:58.248
Don't sweat over this.

1001
00:37:58.478 --> 00:38:01.487
Focus on winning.

1002
00:38:01.487 --> 00:38:03.217
- I'll be lucky today. - Seok Jin stepped on poop.

1003
00:38:03.217 --> 00:38:04.217
(I'll be lucky.)

1004
00:38:04.217 --> 00:38:06.458
- It's all poop. - Look at that.

1005
00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:07.987
(Look at the cows.)

1006
00:38:07.987 --> 00:38:11.197
- But they're brown. - One of them is black.

1007
00:38:11.327 --> 00:38:12.898
- Where? - They're mixed.

1008
00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:14.998
There are so many of them.

1009
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:16.668
There are calves too.

1010
00:38:17.367 --> 00:38:19.367
The black cattle you see over there are...

1011
00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:22.168
- the treasure of Jeju Island. - Black cattle.

1012
00:38:22.168 --> 00:38:23.267
(Jeju's treasure, black cattle)

1013
00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:26.108
They were Jeju Island's specialty in the Joseon dynasty period.

1014
00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:29.978
20 of them were offered to the king...

1015
00:38:29.978 --> 00:38:30.978
every year.

1016
00:38:30.978 --> 00:38:33.017
(Black cattle are rare and taste good.)

1017
00:38:33.278 --> 00:38:35.188
If you complete the black cattle mission,

1018
00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:38.318
you'll win a Chance Card and a meal.

1019
00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:40.017
(They can win a meal.)

1020
00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:41.088
Will we get to eat black cattle?

1021
00:38:41.128 --> 00:38:42.188
Really?

1022
00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:43.458
- Okay. - Black cattle.

1023
00:38:43.787 --> 00:38:44.798
We have to win it.

1024
00:38:44.798 --> 00:38:46.157
This mission is...

1025
00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:48.068
Cow Quiz.

1026
00:38:48.068 --> 00:38:50.298
(Cow Quiz)

1027
00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.537
If you get more than two questions right, you succeed.

1028
00:38:52.637 --> 00:38:54.637
It's a quiz related to cows.

1029
00:38:54.637 --> 00:38:55.967
- Cow Quiz? - It's a quiz?

1030
00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:57.068
(They have to get two or more questions right.)

1031
00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:58.938
- It's a quiz? - I'm bad at quizzes.

1032
00:38:59.608 --> 00:39:01.847
- I'm really bad at quizzes. - It doesn't matter.

1033
00:39:01.847 --> 00:39:04.048
- Don't say that in front of Ji Hyo. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1034
00:39:04.048 --> 00:39:05.378
- That's rude. - She doesn't understand questions.

1035
00:39:05.378 --> 00:39:06.978
- You're nothing compared to her. - I apologize.

1036
00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:09.487
(You and Ji Hyo belong to different classes.)

1037
00:39:09.487 --> 00:39:11.057
- You're not even close to her. - Kwang Soo.

1038
00:39:11.657 --> 00:39:13.717
- Stop talking. - Are you making fun of her?

1039
00:39:13.717 --> 00:39:16.458
- Don't take the title away from me. - She's worse than me.

1040
00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:18.697
(Everyone in the team is bad at solving quizzes.)

1041
00:39:18.697 --> 00:39:21.228
(Can they win the Chance Card and Meal Card for black cattle?)

1042
00:39:21.228 --> 00:39:23.398
- All right. First question. - Okay.

1043
00:39:23.668 --> 00:39:25.767
You know the story "Minister Hwang Hui and the Farmer", right?

1044
00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:29.568
- I don't know much about history. - What is that?

1045
00:39:29.568 --> 00:39:31.208
(He's perplexed.)

1046
00:39:31.807 --> 00:39:34.478
(Minister Hwang Hui? I don't know much about history.)

1047
00:39:35.077 --> 00:39:37.148
It was right after when Joseon had been established as a country.

1048
00:39:37.347 --> 00:39:39.278
Hwang Hui at a young age was walking down the street.

1049
00:39:39.318 --> 00:39:43.148
He met an old man, heading to the field with a brown and a black bull.

1050
00:39:43.487 --> 00:39:47.117
Hwang Hui asked which one did a better job plowing the field.

1051
00:39:47.117 --> 00:39:48.387
The man whispered to his ear,

1052
00:39:48.387 --> 00:39:51.597
"This bull plows the field much better."

1053
00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:56.528
Hwang Hui asked why the old man had whispered to him.

1054
00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:59.637
He answered, "They have ears too."

1055
00:39:59.637 --> 00:40:02.838
"If they hear they're not good, they won't be happy either."

1056
00:40:02.838 --> 00:40:04.838
From this encounter, Hwang Hui had an epiphany.

1057
00:40:04.838 --> 00:40:08.708
Then he carefully chose his words and became a wise prime minister.

1058
00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:10.748
(Wait. This is similar to that.)

1059
00:40:11.418 --> 00:40:13.517
The man covered their ears like he was playing the game, Of Course.

1060
00:40:13.517 --> 00:40:16.418
(Was it similar to the game, Of Course on "X-Man"?)

1061
00:40:16.418 --> 00:40:17.787
- No, it's not. - It's not?

1062
00:40:17.787 --> 00:40:19.657
Kwang Soo, don't associate it with weird stuff.

1063
00:40:19.657 --> 00:40:22.458
I mean, he covered the ears. Didn't he? Isn't it the same?

1064
00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:24.358
- I know this. I got goose bumps. - Are you serious?

1065
00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:25.697
- Here's the question. - I really know this story.

1066
00:40:26.128 --> 00:40:27.998
- In the story I told you, - I have a bad feeling about this.

1067
00:40:28.528 --> 00:40:32.068
The farmer said 1 of the 2 bulls did a better job.

1068
00:40:32.068 --> 00:40:33.898
- Which bull was that? - Is it a multiple-choice question?

1069
00:40:34.068 --> 00:40:35.737
Number One, the black bull.

1070
00:40:35.938 --> 00:40:37.237
Number Two, the brown bull.

1071
00:40:37.267 --> 00:40:38.478
(Ji Hyo is confused.)

1072
00:40:38.537 --> 00:40:40.008
- It's 1 of those 2 choices? - Yes.

1073
00:40:40.537 --> 00:40:41.847
- That's it? - It's 1 of those 2.

1074
00:40:41.907 --> 00:40:43.148
- He picked 1 of the 2? - Kwang Soo, look.

1075
00:40:43.947 --> 00:40:46.847
Kwang Soo, look. We are here to see the black cattle.

1076
00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:49.447
- Black cattle. - So it must be the black bull.

1077
00:40:50.048 --> 00:40:51.258
Or should we expect a twist?

1078
00:40:52.057 --> 00:40:53.358
Minister Hwang Hui...

1079
00:40:53.688 --> 00:40:56.057
- "Hwang" means brown. - Hey.

1080
00:40:56.128 --> 00:40:58.827
- Is it the same character though? - His name does have "Hwang" in it.

1081
00:40:58.827 --> 00:41:01.398
- Are you sure it's the same one? - Yes, it is the same one.

1082
00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:03.927
- Does "Hwang" mean brown? - Does he use the same character?

1083
00:41:03.998 --> 00:41:08.208
(He does use the same Chinese character, but how is it relevant?)

1084
00:41:08.208 --> 00:41:09.537
(What's Ji Hyo's answer?)

1085
00:41:09.537 --> 00:41:10.637
I think it's the black one.

1086
00:41:10.907 --> 00:41:13.108
- I was going to pick the opposite. - Is it the black one?

1087
00:41:13.577 --> 00:41:15.478
- Should we do rock-paper-scissors? - Sure.

1088
00:41:15.677 --> 00:41:18.017
- This is just among us. - Let's do whatever we want.

1089
00:41:18.017 --> 00:41:19.847
- Or we won't make a decision. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1090
00:41:20.447 --> 00:41:23.548
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo win.)

1091
00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:24.918
- I really hope you win. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1092
00:41:24.918 --> 00:41:26.657
- I'll pick Number 1. You'll pick 2. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1093
00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:28.487
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

1094
00:41:28.487 --> 00:41:30.628
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1095
00:41:30.628 --> 00:41:31.758
- Okay. - Which one will it be?

1096
00:41:31.827 --> 00:41:33.657
- I sort of remember this. - What's your answer?

1097
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:34.898
(I think I know.)

1098
00:41:34.898 --> 00:41:37.197
The brown bull. Number Two, brown bull.

1099
00:41:38.467 --> 00:41:42.267
(Kwang Soo keeps saying he remembers the story and is confident.)

1100
00:41:42.338 --> 00:41:47.278
(Their opinions differ. Is his memory reliable?)

1101
00:41:47.907 --> 00:41:50.847
- I told you! See? I told you. - My gosh. You got it right.

1102
00:41:50.847 --> 00:41:53.418
(Kwang Soo's answer is correct.)

1103
00:41:53.548 --> 00:41:55.048
- I knew it. - I kind of remember this.

1104
00:41:55.048 --> 00:41:56.517
- My goodness, Kwang Soo. - It's because...

1105
00:41:56.517 --> 00:41:57.858
I was three when I heard it.

1106
00:41:57.918 --> 00:42:00.458
- When I went to bed, my mother... - The Chinese character...

1107
00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:01.927
- When I went to bed, - Did that help?

1108
00:42:01.927 --> 00:42:04.557
My mom read me this story at the bedside.

1109
00:42:04.557 --> 00:42:06.898
(She read me "Minister Hwang Hui and the Farmer".)

1110
00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:09.427
We managed to read the crew's thought. That's all.

1111
00:42:09.427 --> 00:42:10.998
- Exactly. - Since there are black cattle.

1112
00:42:10.998 --> 00:42:12.767
- Things are going well for us. - Hey.

1113
00:42:12.838 --> 00:42:15.168
- That's what we did. - Let me be really objective.

1114
00:42:15.168 --> 00:42:16.767
"We" didn't manage to do that. "I" got this right.

1115
00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:18.237
- No, that's not true. - I disagree.

1116
00:42:18.237 --> 00:42:19.577
- Kwang Soo. - I was going to pick the brown one.

1117
00:42:19.577 --> 00:42:20.737
I won the rock-paper-scissors.

1118
00:42:20.737 --> 00:42:22.778
- We all contributed to this win. - Then I picked the right one.

1119
00:42:22.778 --> 00:42:25.478
- We all got the right answer. - Let's not do this.

1120
00:42:25.478 --> 00:42:26.548
- Aren't you in the same team? - I...

1121
00:42:26.548 --> 00:42:28.648
- The three of us... - They'll go to the ice rink.

1122
00:42:28.748 --> 00:42:30.447
- I'll go to the suite. - Dream on, Kwang Soo.

1123
00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:33.017
(They will end up on the ice rink, and I'll be in the suite.)

1124
00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.157
We are not in the same team.

1125
00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:36.228
- Okay. He did a good job after all. - Let's do this.

1126
00:42:36.228 --> 00:42:38.128
- Right. You did an excellent job. - Let's compliment him.

1127
00:42:38.128 --> 00:42:39.958
- Why don't we pat him on the back? - Well done.

1128
00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:41.097
- I'm serious. - Well done.

1129
00:42:41.467 --> 00:42:42.597
Great job.

1130
00:42:43.097 --> 00:42:46.097
(His hand dives into the poop while being patted.)

1131
00:42:46.938 --> 00:42:48.008
He touched the poop.

1132
00:42:48.838 --> 00:42:51.637
(This is unbelievable. He dips his hand in the poop.)

1133
00:42:51.637 --> 00:42:53.537
- Come on, Kwang Soo. Unbelievable. - That's disgusting.

1134
00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:55.478
- That's nasty. - Go away. Stay away from us.

1135
00:42:55.478 --> 00:42:56.608
(No way.)

1136
00:42:56.608 --> 00:42:57.608
That's nasty.

1137
00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.347
(He's having fun.)

1138
00:43:00.217 --> 00:43:01.517
This is real poop.

1139
00:43:02.048 --> 00:43:03.318
This is real.

1140
00:43:03.418 --> 00:43:04.858
- Wipe it there. - That's disgusting.

1141
00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:06.017
We must get this right.

1142
00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:07.858
- The staff members are flustered. - They are flustered now.

1143
00:43:08.088 --> 00:43:09.128
Give us a harder one.

1144
00:43:09.128 --> 00:43:10.728
- I was going to do that. - Sure. Take your shot at it.

1145
00:43:10.728 --> 00:43:11.998
- Here's the second question. - Okay.

1146
00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:13.728
You'll all take turns and answer it.

1147
00:43:13.728 --> 00:43:14.927
(For this one, everyone must answer it.)

1148
00:43:14.927 --> 00:43:19.197
Name a celebrity whose surname is So within 5 seconds.

1149
00:43:19.838 --> 00:43:23.267
(That's not a common surname.)

1150
00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:25.108
We will start with Kwang Soo. Get ready. Start.

1151
00:43:25.108 --> 00:43:26.177
- One. - So Yu Jin.

1152
00:43:26.177 --> 00:43:27.237
- Two. - So Ji Sub.

1153
00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:29.278
- 3, 4, - So... So Chan Whee.

1154
00:43:30.878 --> 00:43:35.818
(If Ji Hyo can answer, they'll get the Chance and Meal Cards.)

1155
00:43:35.818 --> 00:43:41.258
(Can she think of one more celebrity whose surname is So?)

1156
00:43:41.258 --> 00:43:42.358
Time is up!

1157
00:43:42.858 --> 00:43:45.228
- So Dingfang. - Who is that?

1158
00:43:45.228 --> 00:43:47.157
There's a Chinese actor named So Dingfang.

1159
00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:48.668
(He should've said that earlier.)

1160
00:43:48.668 --> 00:43:50.267
Then why did you say So Ji Sub earlier?

1161
00:43:50.267 --> 00:43:51.867
(You should've gone with So Dingfang then.)

1162
00:43:52.137 --> 00:43:55.037
(If he knew another one, why did he say So Ji Sub?)

1163
00:43:55.037 --> 00:43:56.508
Then why did you say So Ji Sub earlier?

1164
00:43:56.568 --> 00:43:58.177
- You shouldn't have used that one. - You...

1165
00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.708
(He turns on Kwang Soo for his action.)

1166
00:43:59.708 --> 00:44:00.938
It was you.

1167
00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:03.048
- Why did you say that? - You said that name.

1168
00:44:03.048 --> 00:44:05.148
(He slaps Seok Jin with the dirty hand.)

1169
00:44:05.148 --> 00:44:07.987
- It was you who said his name. - You shouldn't have named him.

1170
00:44:07.987 --> 00:44:13.017
(Kwang Soo's massage with his dirty hand enrages Seok Jin.)

1171
00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:14.117
Stop it.

1172
00:44:14.117 --> 00:44:16.427
(Because of So Dingfang, their unsanitary fight begins.)

1173
00:44:16.657 --> 00:44:18.028
This just turned into a fight of poop.

1174
00:44:18.028 --> 00:44:19.557
(What are they doing?)

1175
00:44:20.358 --> 00:44:21.427
Seriously.

1176
00:44:22.697 --> 00:44:26.367
(Get this poop powder!)

1177
00:44:26.367 --> 00:44:28.838
(I hate you guys.)

1178
00:44:28.938 --> 00:44:31.878
(We're staying away because you guys are disgusting.)

1179
00:44:32.108 --> 00:44:35.378
All right. This is a quiz about a pun.

1180
00:44:35.378 --> 00:44:37.177
I'm good at those.

1181
00:44:37.248 --> 00:44:38.418
It's Pictionary.

1182
00:44:38.418 --> 00:44:40.077
- We'll solve it together, right? - Yes.

1183
00:44:40.318 --> 00:44:42.188
Look at this drawing.

1184
00:44:43.318 --> 00:44:46.057
- Is that a pumpkin? - Guess the title of the drawing.

1185
00:44:46.057 --> 00:44:48.688
(Guess the title of the drawing within 1 minute.)

1186
00:44:48.858 --> 00:44:50.358
- Look at this. - The time limit is one minute.

1187
00:44:50.728 --> 00:44:52.128
This is a cow.

1188
00:44:52.128 --> 00:44:53.258
(The cow is looking at the burning flame.)

1189
00:44:53.258 --> 00:44:56.097
- "My gosh, it's burning nicely." - Hey, keep quiet. Come on.

1190
00:44:56.097 --> 00:44:58.597
- "A big loss for a small gain"? - Could it be a name of a celebrity?

1191
00:44:58.967 --> 00:45:00.398
Or is it beef bulgogi?

1192
00:45:00.438 --> 00:45:01.938
- Cow and the fire. - Cow...

1193
00:45:01.938 --> 00:45:03.208
- Beef bulgogi. - Fluorine.

1194
00:45:03.208 --> 00:45:05.677
- The cow is looking at the fire. - Right.

1195
00:45:05.807 --> 00:45:07.438
The fact that it's looking at the fire is important.

1196
00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:08.947
"Fire" by BTS?

1197
00:45:09.608 --> 00:45:11.818
- Could it be BTS? - No, I don't think so.

1198
00:45:11.818 --> 00:45:13.978
Then tell us how many characters are in the title.

1199
00:45:13.978 --> 00:45:15.947
- There are three. This is the hint. - Okay.

1200
00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:17.387
- He said there are 3. - 3 characters?

1201
00:45:17.617 --> 00:45:19.287
The cow is crossing its legs.

1202
00:45:19.818 --> 00:45:20.918
Beef tripe.

1203
00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.758
(They don't have a clue, but time is ticking away.)

1204
00:45:22.758 --> 00:45:23.958
A fable...

1205
00:45:24.427 --> 00:45:25.898
- How could we get this right? - Hold on.

1206
00:45:25.927 --> 00:45:27.398
- You set us up to fail. - Wait.

1207
00:45:27.398 --> 00:45:28.668
We can tell you the answer, right?

1208
00:45:28.668 --> 00:45:30.028
That's right. Tell us the answer.

1209
00:45:30.028 --> 00:45:32.267
- 5, 4, - This isn't right. It's too hard.

1210
00:45:32.267 --> 00:45:34.967
- 3, 2, 1. - This is too hard. Seriously.

1211
00:45:34.991 --> 00:45:36.991
Bonfire? Mistakes?

1212
00:45:37.015 --> 00:45:40.015
(Third Mission Failed)

1213
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:46.521
(What's the title of the drawing in which a cow is looking at a fire?)

1214
00:45:46.594 --> 00:45:47.793
The answer is...

1215
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.771
(What's the title of the drawing in which a cow is looking at a fire?)

1216
00:45:55.844 --> 00:45:57.043
The answer is...

1217
00:45:57.313 --> 00:45:58.784
It's "Firefighter".

1218
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.530
I don't get the last character.

1219
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:01.960
- The cow is neglecting it. - It's neglecting the fire.

1220
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.429
My gosh. Are you serious?

1221
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.030
You failed to finish your mission.

1222
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.670
- But the thing is... - It's securing the fire.

1223
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:07.940
If it's "Gall Bladder",

1224
00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.909
- shouldn't it hold its stomach? - No, it's "Firefighter".

1225
00:46:09.909 --> 00:46:11.340
(It means the cow has to pee.)

1226
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.909
- No, it's "Firefighter". - "Firefighter".

1227
00:46:13.239 --> 00:46:14.509
I'm sorry.

1228
00:46:14.509 --> 00:46:16.949
- How could you mix those two? - My apologies.

1229
00:46:17.079 --> 00:46:19.320
I can't believe he's in my team.

1230
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.980
He's the worst among us.

1231
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:22.050
- I'll give up. - He's the worst among us.

1232
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.820
I will just go to the ice rink.

1233
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.690
Kwang Soo, please be nice even though I'm bad at this.

1234
00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.559
All right. You failed to accomplish your mission.

1235
00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:31.130
(Do you think you can win the stickers like this?)

1236
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.530
- When will her love - You'll start now.

1237
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.500
- Hey, hey. - We were so close.

1238
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.099
We were so close even though Jae Seok messed up.

1239
00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:39.199
- He made the same mistake twice. - Fine. I got it.

1240
00:46:39.199 --> 00:46:40.400
Why don't you get rid of me then?

1241
00:46:41.099 --> 00:46:43.469
I am planning on it. How did you figure that out?

1242
00:46:43.469 --> 00:46:44.509
(Stop fighting, and try finishing it.)

1243
00:46:44.509 --> 00:46:45.570
All right. Here we go.

1244
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.710
- Play the song, please. - What's my first line?

1245
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.110
- "The story"... - "The story"...

1246
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.050
- "engraved on"... - "engraved on"...

1247
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.719
(They only have 2 chances left. They must go past the first verse.)

1248
00:46:54.949 --> 00:46:58.849
The story engraved.

1249
00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:02.489
On camellia petals.

1250
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:04.860
With a secret.

1251
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.130
(He gets it wrong.)

1252
00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.659
- What just happened? - Hey, that hurts.

1253
00:47:07.659 --> 00:47:09.500
(The trays come down during the second line.)

1254
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.030
- What just happened? What is it? - I can't believe you.

1255
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:15.139
- It's correct up to "with". - What did you say?

1256
00:47:15.139 --> 00:47:16.809
- It's correct up to "with". - With...

1257
00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:17.809
- See? - What are you going to do?

1258
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:19.380
- You nagged me, but you messed up. - Look.

1259
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.539
If you didn't mess up before,

1260
00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:24.050
I would've fixed the lyrics and got them right this time.

1261
00:47:25.679 --> 00:47:26.679
Is it my fault?

1262
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:28.520
Is this my fault?

1263
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.590
(They get violent.)

1264
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:31.920
It's hard to be with this team.

1265
00:47:32.389 --> 00:47:33.719
So Min, is it my fault?

1266
00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:34.889
- Listen. - It's better to lose.

1267
00:47:34.889 --> 00:47:36.090
- I think... - It's because...

1268
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.030
Is this our last chance?

1269
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:39.530
(This is exhausting.)

1270
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:41.099
Here's your last chance.

1271
00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:42.400
Let's give each other a chance.

1272
00:47:42.469 --> 00:47:44.199
- "With the secret story" - Let's do it.

1273
00:47:44.199 --> 00:47:46.270
- Come here. - These are the lyrics.

1274
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:47.739
"With the secret story."

1275
00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:51.039
- With the secret story - With the secret story.

1276
00:47:51.039 --> 00:47:53.610
- In her heart - In her heart, that's right.

1277
00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:59.619
- Camellia Lady is - Camellia Lady is.

1278
00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:00.679
Raise the tone.

1279
00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:05.449
- Waiting - Waiting.

1280
00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:08.719
When will her love.

1281
00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.860
- When will her love come - That's wrong.

1282
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.460
- When will her - When will her love come back?

1283
00:48:14.599 --> 00:48:16.170
When will her... I can't do it.

1284
00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:17.730
The melody is wrong.

1285
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:18.829
- We'll start after we get it. - Hey.

1286
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.800
What are the lyrics?

1287
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.340
When will her love.

1288
00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:26.110
- Come back - Come back.

1289
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.239
- "When will her love"... - "Come back".

1290
00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:31.550
- "Come back". - Is Jong Kook giving a lesson?

1291
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:32.579
What?

1292
00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:34.250
We have to hurry up.

1293
00:48:35.849 --> 00:48:36.889
Goodness.

1294
00:48:36.889 --> 00:48:37.949
Let's sing the last measure together.

1295
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.989
- To the lonely - To the lonely.

1296
00:48:40.989 --> 00:48:43.730
- Camellia Lady - Camellia flower?

1297
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:44.759
- It's not "lady". - Isn't it?

1298
00:48:44.759 --> 00:48:46.000
Camellia Lady.

1299
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.130
- It's not "lady". - Isn't it?

1300
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.730
Camellia.

1301
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.900
(The last measure is the problem.)

1302
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.340
(They get serious.)

1303
00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:57.139
To the lonely.

1304
00:48:57.239 --> 00:49:01.440
- Camellia flower? - Camellia flower?

1305
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.679
"To the lonely camellia flower?"

1306
00:49:02.679 --> 00:49:03.949
- I'm worried. - Let's do it.

1307
00:49:03.949 --> 00:49:05.349
This is your last chance.

1308
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:06.579
(If they fail, they won't win any Bingo Sticker.)

1309
00:49:06.579 --> 00:49:08.480
Camellia Lady.

1310
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.920
Wait, with the secret story...

1311
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.050
- This is the melody. - "With the secret story".

1312
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.659
- Play music. - "The story engraved on".

1313
00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:14.659
Play music.

1314
00:49:14.659 --> 00:49:15.690
- "Camellia petals". - "Camellia petals".

1315
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:16.730
"The story engraved on".

1316
00:49:17.929 --> 00:49:22.099
The story engraved on.

1317
00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:25.940
Camellia petals.

1318
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.770
With the secret story.

1319
00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:32.710
In her heart.

1320
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.880
(Jong Kook sings correctly.)

1321
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.849
Camellia Lady is.

1322
00:49:39.849 --> 00:49:40.849
(Jong Kook guides him.)

1323
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:43.150
Waiting.

1324
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.219
That's right.

1325
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:50.460
Camellia Lady.

1326
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.099
(Haha sings the third measure successfully.)

1327
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.000
(Next is So Min.)

1328
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:59.869
(She seemed unsure during the last practice.)

1329
00:49:59.869 --> 00:50:05.710
(Will So Min sing the correct lyrics?)

1330
00:50:06.139 --> 00:50:09.949
When will her love.

1331
00:50:09.949 --> 00:50:13.750
Come back.

1332
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.320
(She sings correctly.)

1333
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:23.360
(They clear the mission if they sing the last measure correctly.)

1334
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.289
(Will they make it without any mistake?)

1335
00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:31.000
- Camellia flower? - Camellia flower?

1336
00:50:33.099 --> 00:50:35.699
(This must be correct.)

1337
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:43.610
(They clear the mission miraculously.)

1338
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.949
(We can't believe that we did it.)

1339
00:50:45.949 --> 00:50:46.949
We got it.

1340
00:50:46.949 --> 00:50:48.880
- Goodness. - It was difficult.

1341
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.920
It was really difficult.

1342
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.389
- It was difficult. - It was hard.

1343
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.960
Still...

1344
00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.389
- We did it. - Of course.

1345
00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:55.389
We barely made it.

1346
00:50:55.389 --> 00:50:58.690
(Camellia Hill is cleared.)

1347
00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.000
There's a piece of paper.

1348
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.599
- Meat noodles. - We'll pick...

1349
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.130
- meat noodles. - Okay.

1350
00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.199
(Let's go eat meat noodles.)

1351
00:51:04.199 --> 00:51:06.440
Before you go,

1352
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.570
you need to pick a Chance Card.

1353
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.969
(It's time to pick another Chance Card.)

1354
00:51:10.969 --> 00:51:12.009
We have no choice, right?

1355
00:51:12.009 --> 00:51:13.380
(We have to pick a good one.)

1356
00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.780
There are...

1357
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.650
Steal Card, Cancel Card,

1358
00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:20.820
Exchange Card, and Dud. It's a total of four.

1359
00:51:20.949 --> 00:51:22.520
- I'll pick if you don't want to. - How about this?

1360
00:51:22.889 --> 00:51:23.989
- Let's pick. - I'll pick if you don't want to.

1361
00:51:23.989 --> 00:51:25.590
(Jong Kook picks a Chance Card.)

1362
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.619
We picked one.

1363
00:51:27.759 --> 00:51:29.659
- That's great. It's Steal Card. - Steal Card.

1364
00:51:29.659 --> 00:51:32.259
(Team Senior Yu picks a Steal Card.)

1365
00:51:32.259 --> 00:51:34.730
(Let's steal Team Junior Jee's land.)

1366
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:35.829
Do we get to steal it?

1367
00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.400
That's right.

1368
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.929
Where did they go?

1369
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:40.070
They went to see black cattle.

1370
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.369
This one? That's good.

1371
00:51:41.369 --> 00:51:43.110
We can pick the same, right?

1372
00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:45.570
Take off the sticker...

1373
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.610
and put it on the black cattle.

1374
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.250
Why?

1375
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.980
(Why would we take ours off?)

1376
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.849
The other team picked a Steal Card. You stole from each other.

1377
00:51:56.989 --> 00:51:59.090
- Goodness. - Did they steal too?

1378
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.920
(They ended up switching their land.)

1379
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.389
We should have picked a Cancel Card.

1380
00:52:04.929 --> 00:52:10.199
(Team Junior Jee picks a Steal Card.)

1381
00:52:10.599 --> 00:52:16.039
(They steal Camellia Hills from Team Senior Yu.)

1382
00:52:16.039 --> 00:52:19.679
(The teams switch places.)

1383
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.880
Let's go while showing off.

1384
00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.710
- Let's go to mandarin trees. - Let's go.

1385
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:24.849
- Go to mandarin tress. - Let's go to mandarin trees.

1386
00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:25.880
Let's go.

1387
00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:28.320
We work quite well as a team.

1388
00:52:28.449 --> 00:52:30.420
We can say that if we win.

1389
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:31.449
Let's win.

1390
00:52:31.449 --> 00:52:33.259
However, if we lose,

1391
00:52:34.389 --> 00:52:37.090
we can't ever be on the same team.

1392
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:39.530
What about just once more?

1393
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:40.559
- If we lose... - Just once more.

1394
00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:42.469
Let's surprise everyone today...

1395
00:52:42.469 --> 00:52:44.270
instead of betraying each other.

1396
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:46.000
There's no reason to betray each other.

1397
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.239
(They promise not to betray each other.)

1398
00:52:47.239 --> 00:52:50.009
Wait, Haha sent me a text message.

1399
00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:54.579
(Did he send Team Senior Yu's secret information?)

1400
00:52:54.579 --> 00:52:55.610
What did he say?

1401
00:52:56.079 --> 00:52:58.880
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1402
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.650
- Goodness. - What is it?

1403
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.949
(Was the text message related to Kwang Soo?)

1404
00:53:03.949 --> 00:53:05.020
Who is it from?

1405
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.360
Kwang Soo sent a message to Haha.

1406
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.759
I sent it a long time ago.

1407
00:53:09.759 --> 00:53:11.130
It was a long time ago.

1408
00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:12.530
"Haha, please pick me."

1409
00:53:12.659 --> 00:53:14.530
"My team is hopeless."

1410
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.570
"I'll do anything for you. I'll help you win."

1411
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.400
"I'll do anything for you. I'll help you win."

1412
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.270
I sent that before the game.

1413
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.199
- Let's check the time. - Before the game.

1414
00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:23.270
(Kwang Soo tried to be a spy.)

1415
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:24.539
- Kwang Soo. - It was a long time ago.

1416
00:53:24.539 --> 00:53:25.670
It was during my childhood.

1417
00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.340
My goodness.

1418
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.509
(It was 10 minutes ago.)

1419
00:53:29.509 --> 00:53:32.349
I think everyone got a text message.

1420
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:34.219
- Let me check. - "Please pick me."

1421
00:53:34.219 --> 00:53:35.650
"My team is hopeless."

1422
00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:36.820
"I'll do anything for you."

1423
00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.389
- Is it from Kwang Soo? - "I'll help you win."

1424
00:53:38.389 --> 00:53:39.860
He also sent me a message...

1425
00:53:39.989 --> 00:53:40.989
a while ago.

1426
00:53:40.989 --> 00:53:43.460
I'll forward it to Seok Jin and Se Chan.

1427
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.530
That's a good idea.

1428
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:45.530
(He tells on Kwang Soo.)

1429
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.960
- Before we left... - Well,

1430
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.360
it could be before we left.

1431
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.570
Do you think I'd do the same?

1432
00:53:50.369 --> 00:53:52.030
- Gosh, Kwang Soo. - Would I do the same?

1433
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.940
That was harsh, Kwang Soo.

1434
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.099
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1435
00:53:55.099 --> 00:53:56.869
Stop thinking about betraying.

1436
00:53:57.039 --> 00:53:58.409
- It's already late. - You should think about winning.

1437
00:53:58.409 --> 00:53:59.440
I agree.

1438
00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.579
I'll be honest. I wasn't going to say it.

1439
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:03.949
I had a big dream.

1440
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.480
What dream?

1441
00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.849
- Winning alone? - By sending the message,

1442
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.150
I wanted to use it against them.

1443
00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.489
Come on, Kwang Soo.

1444
00:54:14.489 --> 00:54:16.059
Okay, goodness.

1445
00:54:16.289 --> 00:54:17.929
He totally fooled us.

1446
00:54:18.289 --> 00:54:20.500
- Kwang Soo. - Seriously.

1447
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.360
You're a piece of trash.

1448
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:25.030
- You're a piece of trash. - Kwang Soo.

1449
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:26.099
You're creeping me out.

1450
00:54:26.099 --> 00:54:27.469
I wanted to use it.

1451
00:54:27.469 --> 00:54:29.340
- Drop the subject. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1452
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.739
Can't you understand it?

1453
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:32.739
Okay, Kwang Soo.

1454
00:54:32.739 --> 00:54:34.840
(Seok Jin does something on his phone.)

1455
00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.150
- This is frustrating. - I tried to use it against them.

1456
00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.380
- This is frustrating. - I tried to use it against them.

1457
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.849
Wait, Seok Jin.

1458
00:54:41.849 --> 00:54:43.320
Did you send a text message?

1459
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.349
No.

1460
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:45.550
Did you send a text message?

1461
00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:47.520
- No, how could I? - What?

1462
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.659
- Seok Jin. - I didn't.

1463
00:54:50.059 --> 00:54:52.289
Ji Hyo, verify it with Jae Seok.

1464
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:53.300
(They call Jae Seok to verify.)

1465
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.259
- You can't do that as our leader. - You're frustrating.

1466
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:57.270
Ji Hyo.

1467
00:54:57.369 --> 00:54:59.369
Did Seok Jin send you a text message?

1468
00:54:59.369 --> 00:55:00.670
Yes, he did.

1469
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:02.469
(He answers without hesitating.)

1470
00:55:02.469 --> 00:55:03.710
- Seok Jin! - Seok Jin.

1471
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:05.840
What if I didn't notice?

1472
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.880
(He's another cheater.)

1473
00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.940
- What's wrong with everyone? - No.

1474
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.550
- This is wrong. - What if I didn't notice?

1475
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:12.050
This is wrong, Seok Jin.

1476
00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.219
What did Seok Jin say in his message?

1477
00:55:14.219 --> 00:55:15.619
He said that he's an X-man...

1478
00:55:15.619 --> 00:55:17.520
and will destroy the team.

1479
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.219
(Jae Seok repeats exactly what Seok Jin wrote him.)

1480
00:55:21.219 --> 00:55:23.059
Stop it. Goodness.

1481
00:55:23.389 --> 00:55:24.929
- Hey. - Forget it, Seok Jin.

1482
00:55:24.929 --> 00:55:26.400
It's our strategy.

1483
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.929
What's wrong with him?

1484
00:55:28.159 --> 00:55:30.130
This is driving me crazy.

1485
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.170
- We got it. - My plan worked perfectly.

1486
00:55:33.469 --> 00:55:35.340
- I knew it. - They'll be...

1487
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.710
- completely fooled by us. - They'll be fooled.

1488
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:38.739
They'll fall for it.

1489
00:55:39.509 --> 00:55:40.710
- I knew it. - Seok Jin.

1490
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.039
The other team is...

1491
00:55:42.039 --> 00:55:43.349
- in my hands. - Right.

1492
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:45.380
- I knew it. We have... - They're in my hands.

1493
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.719
Control over them.

1494
00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:48.820
- This is ridiculous. - Okay.

1495
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.119
We'll win today.

1496
00:55:50.119 --> 00:55:52.389
(They head for the mandarin tree mission.)

1497
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.090
Is it in the middle of a city?

1498
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:56.230
Is there a mandarin farm in the city?

1499
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:57.860
Look to the front.

1500
00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.230
(Look at that.)

1501
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.630
- It suddenly appeared. - It's great.

1502
00:56:00.659 --> 00:56:02.000
It suddenly appeared.

1503
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.630
- There's a view of nature. - What's that?

1504
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:06.440
It's a house with a stone fence.

1505
00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.800
Is there a mandarin farm here?

1506
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.469
This is it.

1507
00:56:10.809 --> 00:56:12.409
The tree in the back...

1508
00:56:12.409 --> 00:56:14.909
was planted in 1911. It's the first mandarin tree in Jeju Island.

1509
00:56:14.909 --> 00:56:16.380
- In 1911? - It was in 1911.

1510
00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.909
- What? Was it in 1911? - "To express gratitude..."

1511
00:56:18.949 --> 00:56:21.050
"for King cherry trees sent from Korea,."

1512
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.520
"Japan sent 14 mandarin trees."

1513
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.550
"The first one was planted in Jeju Island."

1514
00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:28.489
(It's the first Jeju mandarin tree.)

1515
00:56:28.489 --> 00:56:30.929
- It's... - The tree is older than Seok Jin.

1516
00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:32.190
- Right. - It's much older than him.

1517
00:56:32.559 --> 00:56:34.059
Do mandarins grow?

1518
00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:36.270
- It's very old. - Do mandarins still grow?

1519
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:37.599
- Yes. - Do they still grow?

1520
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.039
There they are.

1521
00:56:40.039 --> 00:56:41.239
- There's one. - They're on the tree.

1522
00:56:41.239 --> 00:56:42.610
- There are two. - Really?

1523
00:56:42.739 --> 00:56:43.909
They're really there.

1524
00:56:43.909 --> 00:56:45.210
They must be expensive.

1525
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:46.940
Here's your next mission.

1526
00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.009
(What's their mission?)

1527
00:56:48.009 --> 00:56:49.849
It's called Find This Person in Jeju Island.

1528
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:51.949
(Find This Person in Jeju Island)

1529
00:56:51.949 --> 00:56:55.449
Find a person who's native to Jeju Island without a mandarin tree...

1530
00:56:55.449 --> 00:56:58.349
neither at his home nor at his relatives'.

1531
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:59.659
- Then you clear the mission. - Relatives?

1532
00:56:59.659 --> 00:57:00.989
- I see. - What do you mean relatives?

1533
00:57:00.989 --> 00:57:02.159
Up to cousins.

1534
00:57:02.159 --> 00:57:04.190
- They must live in an apartment. - Right.

1535
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:05.360
(Mandarins are a specialty in Jeju Island.)

1536
00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:09.329
(Does every other person in Jeju Island own a mandarin tree?)

1537
00:57:10.429 --> 00:57:13.340
(I have mandarin trees in the yard. We grow mandarins too.)

1538
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.039
(There are only mandarin trees. We have mandarin trees at home.)

1539
00:57:16.239 --> 00:57:17.809
I heard that...

1540
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:19.280
mandarin trees are very common.

1541
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.009
- They're everywhere? - Everyone has a tree at home.

1542
00:57:22.009 --> 00:57:23.849
But there are so many apartment buildings.

1543
00:57:24.409 --> 00:57:25.920
(Will they be able to find someone who has no mandarin trees?)

1544
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.150
Just find one person.

1545
00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:28.619
- You don't have much time. Hurry. - Let's go.

1546
00:57:28.619 --> 00:57:30.750
It might not take so long.

1547
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:33.360
If we're lucky, we might find someone soon.

1548
00:57:33.759 --> 00:57:35.590
It might not take so long.

1549
00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:36.630
Here.

1550
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:39.199
(He drives the car for the staff.)

1551
00:57:39.199 --> 00:57:41.159
- Hello. - Hello.

1552
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.730
- Are you from Jeju Island? - Yes.

1553
00:57:44.469 --> 00:57:46.869
Do you have mandarin trees at home?

1554
00:57:46.869 --> 00:57:50.170
(Do you have mandarin trees at home?)

1555
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:51.309
Yes, I do.

1556
00:57:51.869 --> 00:57:53.739
- I see. Thank you. - Yes, I do.

1557
00:57:53.739 --> 00:57:55.179
(He has mandarin trees.)

1558
00:57:55.179 --> 00:57:56.480
- Thank you. - Mandarins taste good.

1559
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.480
They do.

1560
00:57:58.349 --> 00:58:00.949
- Most own mandarin trees, right? - Yes.

1561
00:58:00.949 --> 00:58:02.889
Do you know anyone...

1562
00:58:02.889 --> 00:58:05.320
who doesn't have mandarin trees?

1563
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:06.389
- There aren't many. - See?

1564
00:58:06.389 --> 00:58:08.389
We're looking for someone...

1565
00:58:08.389 --> 00:58:11.159
whose relatives don't have mandarin trees either.

1566
00:58:11.559 --> 00:58:12.599
There won't be many.

1567
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.960
- 80 percent will have them. - 80 percent?

1568
00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:17.300
We'll have to find the 20 percent.

1569
00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:18.829
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1570
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:19.900
Thank you.

1571
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:21.440
(It might be harder than we thought.)

1572
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.440
- My goodness. - How are we going to find them?

1573
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.309
I see no people.

1574
00:58:26.539 --> 00:58:29.039
- There are no people. - It's Monday.

1575
00:58:29.039 --> 00:58:30.050
(The street is empty.)

1576
00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.110
Everyone must be working.

1577
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:33.250
I can't believe this. Cheonjiyeon Waterfall is near here.

1578
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:34.820
- Where? - Cheonjiyeon Waterfall...

1579
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:38.150
Won't there be a lot of people from Jeju Island there?

1580
00:58:38.989 --> 00:58:40.989
Isn't it too far?

1581
00:58:40.989 --> 00:58:42.530
Look at that sign.

1582
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:44.460
- Where? - Over there.

1583
00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:45.630
It's behind that tree.

1584
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.230
Hey, it doesn't mean that the waterfall is near here.

1585
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:50.770
The sign is just to say...

1586
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:52.170
it's in that direction.

1587
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:53.670
It might be 50km away.

1588
00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:56.170
I'm sorry, but we're a team.

1589
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:58.440
- She just didn't make sense. - Listen to...

1590
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.139
your team members.

1591
00:59:00.239 --> 00:59:01.340
I'll find someone.

1592
00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:04.349
- Hello, sir. - Ask him.

1593
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:05.949
(Polite)

1594
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.380
- Are you from Jeju Island? - Yes. I live over there.

1595
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.949
Are you from here?

1596
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:12.090
Do you have mandarin trees?

1597
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.559
(Step 2)

1598
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.989
I don't.

1599
00:59:17.489 --> 00:59:18.559
What about...

1600
00:59:18.559 --> 00:59:20.360
Does any of your relatives...

1601
00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.099
have mandarin trees?

1602
00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:24.170
Your cousins.

1603
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:27.639
(They found someone who is from here and doesn't have mandarin trees.)

1604
00:59:27.639 --> 00:59:30.610
(Do his relatives have mandarin trees?)

1605
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:32.270
My in-laws do.

1606
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:34.539
(My relatives do.)

1607
00:59:34.539 --> 00:59:36.280
(I see.)

1608
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.949
His in-laws...

1609
00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:40.150
- His relatives do. - Thank you.

1610
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:41.179
Thank you.

1611
00:59:41.179 --> 00:59:42.550
- His in-laws do. - Thank you.

1612
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:43.590
I wish your family happiness.

1613
00:59:44.449 --> 00:59:46.460
It's hard.

1614
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.159
Their relatives have mandarin trees.

1615
00:59:48.159 --> 00:59:50.130
Someone might be allergic to mandarins.

1616
00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:52.530
If we find that person, we'll succeed.

1617
00:59:52.659 --> 00:59:53.759
That's right.

1618
00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:56.000
- If the whole family is allergic... - Exactly.

1619
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.329
There's a supermarket.

1620
00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:00.969
Does any of your relatives have mandarin trees?

1621
01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:01.969
Yes.

1622
01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:04.739
- My aunt does. - Your aunt.

1623
01:00:04.739 --> 01:00:06.940
Do you have mandarin trees?

1624
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:09.480
Why? I do.

1625
01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:11.349
- We're asking around. - I hope...

1626
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:13.050
your trees will grow well.

1627
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:14.349
Thank you.

1628
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:15.380
(Culture shock)

1629
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.420
- Here. - Please.

1630
01:00:17.619 --> 01:00:18.849
Hello.

1631
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.659
Are you from Jeju Island?

1632
01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.400
- Are you from Jeju Island? - Yes.

1633
01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:28.460
Do you have mandarin trees?

1634
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.630
- No. - Okay.

1635
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:31.170
- The final question. - The final question.

1636
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:35.070
Does any of your relatives have mandarin trees?

1637
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:36.070
- Your cousins. - Your cousins.

1638
01:00:36.509 --> 01:00:38.969
(What's his answer?)

1639
01:00:40.909 --> 01:00:41.940
No.

1640
01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.309
We found him.

1641
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.750
(They finally found someone.)

1642
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.150
- We found him. - Thank you.

1643
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.150
We found him.

1644
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.289
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1645
01:00:50.289 --> 01:00:51.289
Happy New Year.

1646
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:52.789
Let's buy one of these.

1647
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.020
- Mission complete. - Okay.

1648
01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.130
(They found someone after 30 minutes.)

1649
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.130
Thank you.

1650
01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.630
(They finally completed the mission.)

1651
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.929
- We succeeded. - There were no more people to ask.

1652
01:01:01.929 --> 01:01:03.099
- The mandarin tree. - Okay.

1653
01:01:03.099 --> 01:01:05.530
We can complete the whole mission soon.

1654
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:06.869
- We'll be done soon. - We have only one more.

1655
01:01:06.869 --> 01:01:07.869
Let's go there.

1656
01:01:07.869 --> 01:01:08.900
(They only have to visit the shape of Korean Peninsula.)

1657
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.210
- We have to win a Chance Card. - That's right.

1658
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.409
It's important.

1659
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.909
Who wants to draw it?

1660
01:01:14.239 --> 01:01:15.280
Chance Cards...

1661
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1662
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.849
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1663
01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:19.849
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1664
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:20.849
Rock-paper-scissors.

1665
01:01:20.849 --> 01:01:21.949
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

1666
01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:23.520
Rock-paper-scissors.

1667
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:24.920
(Se Chan wins.)

1668
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.119
Okay.

1669
01:01:26.119 --> 01:01:27.389
- Se Chan... - Pick one.

1670
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.130
He's unlucky.

1671
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:30.860
- Just avoid the dud. - Just avoid the dud.

1672
01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.829
(What does his reaction mean?)

1673
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:34.860
Oh, my.

1674
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.440
(Dud)

1675
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.000
How can this be possible?

1676
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.270
(He picked the dud.)

1677
01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:47.280
(We won't say anything.)

1678
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.940
How can this be possible?

1679
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.980
I have nothing to say.

1680
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.179
(Why did you win rock-paper-scissors?)

1681
01:01:53.449 --> 01:01:54.550
- I think... - I mean...

1682
01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.550
we're meant to sleep in the ice rink.

1683
01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.090
- How can I pick the dud? - Come here.

1684
01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:59.619
Come here.

1685
01:01:59.619 --> 01:02:00.820
I can't believe it.

1686
01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:02.119
The other team...

1687
01:02:02.889 --> 01:02:05.329
completed the meat noodle mission.

1688
01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:07.259
We have to go there then.

1689
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:09.270
And...

1690
01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:11.730
- the other team... - No way.

1691
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.070
Picked an Exchange Card.

1692
01:02:13.699 --> 01:02:16.440
Black cattle and Camellia Hill got switched again.

1693
01:02:16.909 --> 01:02:18.539
(Then it means...)

1694
01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:21.009
They must want to eliminate the name tag.

1695
01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.880
It seems so.

1696
01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.009
Then we could try to do that too.

1697
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:25.380
That's right.

1698
01:02:26.219 --> 01:02:27.219
We can win that way.

1699
01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:29.190
- That's right. - Let's avoid it.

1700
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:31.250
- Exchange Card or... - We'll go there...

1701
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:33.090
- and there. - There.

1702
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.159
We'll go to the oldest building in Jeju Island.

1703
01:02:35.159 --> 01:02:36.159
Let's go.

1704
01:02:36.559 --> 01:02:38.190
We'll pick a Chance Card here and...

1705
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:40.199
- They want to remove the name tag. - It's hard.

1706
01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:41.300
(How will their strategy pay off?)

1707
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.469
Everyone seems to be enjoying.

1708
01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:44.969
It looks so tasty.

1709
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.170
Four bowls will be served.

1710
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.039
I can't wait to taste it.

1711
01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:51.110
It's coming.

1712
01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:52.539
(Steaming)

1713
01:02:52.539 --> 01:02:53.840
- It's... - It's steaming.

1714
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880
(Thick pork broth)

1715
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.909
- It's... - Thank you.

1716
01:02:57.909 --> 01:02:59.079
(It's been boiled for many hours.)

1717
01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:00.849
The broth looks so thick.

1718
01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:03.650
It looks so tasty.

1719
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:04.650
(60 years of history)

1720
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.320
It looks amazing.

1721
01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:09.329
- Let's try. - It looks so...

1722
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:12.360
It has 60 years of history.

1723
01:03:13.759 --> 01:03:15.360
(Slurping)

1724
01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:19.170
(Enjoying)

1725
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.599
- How does it taste? - Good.

1726
01:03:20.599 --> 01:03:22.539
(Slurping)

1727
01:03:22.539 --> 01:03:23.539
It tastes good.

1728
01:03:23.539 --> 01:03:24.739
(She slurps the noodles.)

1729
01:03:24.739 --> 01:03:25.739
It tastes very good.

1730
01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:29.039
(The tasty noodles...)

1731
01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:31.050
(fill her mouth.)

1732
01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:33.550
It was worth our efforts.

1733
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:35.380
(The family is finally at peace.)

1734
01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.449
The broth is so thick.

1735
01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:40.119
(It tastes even better with meat and kimchi.)

1736
01:03:40.119 --> 01:03:41.119
It tastes great.

1737
01:03:41.389 --> 01:03:42.659
Things are going so well.

1738
01:03:42.659 --> 01:03:44.130
(Our team is the best.)

1739
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:46.159
My heart is warming up.

1740
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.400
Really.

1741
01:03:50.429 --> 01:03:51.730
Let's go.

1742
01:03:51.969 --> 01:03:54.039
- We have to... - We have to eliminate...

1743
01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.369
We have to eliminate the name tag.

1744
01:03:55.369 --> 01:03:56.710
I think we'll succeed.

1745
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:58.509
We have to go where they're going.

1746
01:03:58.539 --> 01:04:01.110
Call Kwang Soo and ask.

1747
01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:03.809
(He's calling Kwang Soo.)

1748
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:05.980
- Hello? - Kwang Soo.

1749
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.079
- Yes? - Why did you call me?

1750
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.550
Where are you going?

1751
01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:11.820
- Where are we going? - Yes.

1752
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.020
We haven't decided yet. We just finished eating.

1753
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.530
Where are you going?

1754
01:04:17.759 --> 01:04:20.159
- We should meet... - Yes.

1755
01:04:20.159 --> 01:04:21.929
And settle things. Let's meet.

1756
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.070
Where are you going?

1757
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.699
Where are you going, Kwang Soo?

1758
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.500
We're going to see the shape of Korean Peninsula.

1759
01:04:29.509 --> 01:04:33.739
(In fact, they're going to the oldest building in Jeju Island.)

1760
01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:36.909
Not the oldest building in Jeju Island?

1761
01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:38.179
(Sharp)

1762
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.579
- What? - The oldest building.

1763
01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:43.889
(Well...)

1764
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:46.090
Are you sure you're not going there?

1765
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.119
We have to meet once anyway.

1766
01:04:48.119 --> 01:04:49.329
Let's meet.

1767
01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:53.360
Well... Let's meet.

1768
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.400
(Let's meet.)

1769
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.130
- The way he speaks. - The way you speak.

1770
01:04:59.239 --> 01:05:02.039
- I think we'll meet anyway. - Okay.

1771
01:05:02.039 --> 01:05:03.239
Let's do this.

1772
01:05:03.239 --> 01:05:04.909
Let's meet at the oldest building in Jeju Island.

1773
01:05:04.909 --> 01:05:07.409
Bring the oldest guy, Seok Jin.

1774
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.509
Hey. Who is your target?

1775
01:05:09.509 --> 01:05:10.550
(Suddenly)

1776
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:12.250
What?

1777
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:13.949
- What are you doing? - Who is your target?

1778
01:05:13.949 --> 01:05:18.289
All of you would be easy targets for us.

1779
01:05:18.449 --> 01:05:20.360
But we picked the easiest opponent.

1780
01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.920
(They picked the easiest opponent.)

1781
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.289
- It must be you. - Is it me?

1782
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:25.289
(Surprised)

1783
01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.460
- Is it me? - It must be you.

1784
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.099
Yes, it's you.

1785
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:31.199
- Bingo. - Is it really me?

1786
01:05:31.199 --> 01:05:32.369
Bingo.

1787
01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:33.599
Let's meet first.

1788
01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:34.699
(Let's meet.)

1789
01:05:34.699 --> 01:05:36.270
Let's do this.

1790
01:05:37.009 --> 01:05:38.739
- Okay. - Gosh.

1791
01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:41.139
Gosh, I wonder who their target is.

1792
01:05:41.139 --> 01:05:43.050
Gosh, I'm so curious.

1793
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.050
It's about time one of them betrayed the others.

1794
01:05:46.619 --> 01:05:48.219
If someone tells us who their target is...

1795
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:50.590
Should we promise that we'll spare that person?

1796
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:52.150
(They approach Seok Jin.)

1797
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:53.559
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

1798
01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:55.190
Just listen.

1799
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:57.730
(He turns off the speaker.)

1800
01:05:58.030 --> 01:05:59.360
- Okay. - Seok Jin.

1801
01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:02.670
- Isn't it on speaker? - I turned it off.

1802
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:04.770
- Just listen. - Okay.

1803
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:06.969
- If you... - Yes?

1804
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.639
Text me who your target is,

1805
01:06:10.639 --> 01:06:12.039
we'll spare you...

1806
01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:13.739
if we win.

1807
01:06:13.739 --> 01:06:16.179
It's a promise.

1808
01:06:16.179 --> 01:06:18.750
Okay? Text me the name.

1809
01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:19.880
Okay.

1810
01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.719
Why would you say that while we're shooting?

1811
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:24.889
You could have texted me.

1812
01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.360
What did he say?

1813
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.460
- What? - What did he say?

1814
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.130
He said they weren't shooting. He talked about something else.

1815
01:06:33.559 --> 01:06:35.630
Seok Jin. What are you doing right now?

1816
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:37.000
Gosh.

1817
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.400
I'm getting irritated.

1818
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.570
- What's with you? - He talked about something else.

1819
01:06:41.739 --> 01:06:44.440
- Let's ignore Seok Jin from now on. - Gosh.

1820
01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.040
Gosh.

1821
01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.110
I don't know anymore.

1822
01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.749
Just know that you're already at a disadvantage.

1823
01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:54.450
- Have you heard from Seok Jin yet? - No.

1824
01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:57.020
I think he's thinking.

1825
01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:59.620
Why isn't he telling us?

1826
01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.190
We're here.

1827
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:02.660
(They arrive at the oldest building in Jeju Island.)

1828
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.330
This must be the oldest...

1829
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:09.299
This building has been designated as treasure number 322.

1830
01:07:09.299 --> 01:07:12.099
Built in 1448, it's the oldest building in Jeju Island.

1831
01:07:12.099 --> 01:07:13.499
- We're here. - It's called Gwandeogjeong.

1832
01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:14.599
Gwandeogjeong.

1833
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.969
It's right in the center of the city,

1834
01:07:16.969 --> 01:07:19.679
so people often use this place as a meeting point.

1835
01:07:19.879 --> 01:07:21.610
- A meeting point. - The next mission is called...

1836
01:07:21.639 --> 01:07:23.379
Meet a Celebrity.

1837
01:07:23.379 --> 01:07:25.450
(Meet a Celebrity)

1838
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:27.419
Meet a celebrity who's in Jeju Island right now...

1839
01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:29.049
- and take a picture with them. - What?

1840
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:31.320
Meet a celebrity who's in Jeju Island right now...

1841
01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.919
- and take a picture with them. - What?

1842
01:07:32.919 --> 01:07:35.190
My friend, Jin Ho, is here right now.

1843
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.690
Kim Jin Ho from SG Wannabe.

1844
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.559
- Really? - He's in Jeju Island right now.

1845
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:39.830
- He's here? - Yes.

1846
01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.499
- I was going to... - Tell him to come.

1847
01:07:41.499 --> 01:07:43.669
I don't know if he's nearby. I wonder where he is.

1848
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.730
- But if we... - Lee Jung.

1849
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.799
But if we rip a name tag, we're done.

1850
01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:50.540
(We just need to rip a name tag.)

1851
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.110
Right?

1852
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.309
(Both teams will get a bingo.)

1853
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:55.639
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

1854
01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:58.049
We have to eliminate their name tag.

1855
01:07:58.049 --> 01:08:00.450
- We have to. There's no other way. - I agree.

1856
01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:02.219
- We have to guess again. - Of course.

1857
01:08:02.219 --> 01:08:03.450
What? It's me.

1858
01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:05.490
(What? It's me.)

1859
01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:07.959
It's me. He said it's me.

1860
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.160
- What? - He texted me. It's me.

1861
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:11.230
- Really? - Yes.

1862
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:12.999
He said it's So Min. Look.

1863
01:08:13.299 --> 01:08:14.429
Look.

1864
01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:16.330
- "I'll pick you." - Really?

1865
01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.599
"It's So Min." That's what it said.

1866
01:08:17.599 --> 01:08:20.169
Really? It's really you?

1867
01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:21.339
(What is Seok Jin's strategy?)

1868
01:08:22.509 --> 01:08:24.110
I'm going to send it.

1869
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:26.040
- Seok Jin, I... - I'm going to say it's So Min.

1870
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.610
(Watch me.)

1871
01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.879
(They're going to pretend like they're attacking So Min.)

1872
01:08:29.879 --> 01:08:31.910
Let's run at So Min.

1873
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:33.249
Jong Kook will try to block us, right?

1874
01:08:33.249 --> 01:08:34.480
Let's rip his name tag then.

1875
01:08:36.089 --> 01:08:38.450
- He said it's me. - We can't trust him though.

1876
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:40.820
Pretend like it's me...

1877
01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:43.389
and protect me.

1878
01:08:43.459 --> 01:08:45.830
I'm sorry, but this is my team.

1879
01:08:45.999 --> 01:08:48.860
- I'll make the calls. - Fine.

1880
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.599
(Stay out of this.)

1881
01:08:50.599 --> 01:08:52.999
- Why are you doing this? - Each person...

1882
01:08:52.999 --> 01:08:54.499
Each person should... Hold on.

1883
01:08:54.499 --> 01:08:56.240
- Don't you know this is my team? - Hold on.

1884
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.339
All of a sudden?

1885
01:08:57.339 --> 01:08:58.809
- It's not all of a sudden. - Look.

1886
01:08:58.809 --> 01:09:00.540
- This is my team. - Look at this guy.

1887
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:03.450
I formed the foundation for the team and all of a sudden?

1888
01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.049
I get this team is named after you,

1889
01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.879
but you should be satisfied with the team name.

1890
01:09:08.179 --> 01:09:09.589
- Let's get away. - Hey.

1891
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:13.120
If we have one less person, it's a disadvantage.

1892
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:14.620
That's right.

1893
01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.990
That's the only way for us to win.

1894
01:09:16.129 --> 01:09:17.190
See?

1895
01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:20.059
I want my team to win.

1896
01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.259
Here.

1897
01:09:21.259 --> 01:09:22.900
(He did something honorable, and he's full of confidence.)

1898
01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.040
I'll say it's Jong Kook then.

1899
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:29.309
It's weird if we don't mention his name.

1900
01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.910
That means you're only trying to save yourself.

1901
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:33.009
How?

1902
01:09:33.009 --> 01:09:34.280
How does it matter?

1903
01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:37.780
- How does that matter? - Let's all say it's Jong Kook.

1904
01:09:37.879 --> 01:09:39.419
I'm trying to trick them.

1905
01:09:39.419 --> 01:09:41.320
- It's odd if we don't mention him. - Se Chan.

1906
01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.520
We're in this situation, so let's all send it.

1907
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.059
You're a weasel.

1908
01:09:46.089 --> 01:09:48.520
You consider me that way? Fine.

1909
01:09:49.889 --> 01:09:51.129
(Look who's accusing me.)

1910
01:09:51.129 --> 01:09:52.290
- So Min. - Yes.

1911
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:54.330
What if I get blown away?

1912
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.070
- Hey. - What is wrong with her?

1913
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.830
(Why does she want to get punished?)

1914
01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:00.400
Why are you trying this?

1915
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.440
Jong Kook held the club.

1916
01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.209
- You have layers on, so it's okay. - Jong Kook.

1917
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.040
- Jong Kook. - Does that hurt?

1918
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:07.240
(You have layers on so it's okay.)

1919
01:10:07.809 --> 01:10:09.009
- Does that hurt? - Jong Kook.

1920
01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:10.849
- Hey, don't do that. - Jae Seok.

1921
01:10:10.849 --> 01:10:11.980
- Try it. - Lie down.

1922
01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.020
- Lie down. - Let me try.

1923
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.379
Lie down for me.

1924
01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:19.759
You hit his lower back.

1925
01:10:19.759 --> 01:10:21.089
- I'm sorry. - You hit his lower back.

1926
01:10:21.719 --> 01:10:23.929
(She hits the wrong spot.)

1927
01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:25.290
You hit his lower back.

1928
01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:26.599
(This is ridiculous.)

1929
01:10:26.599 --> 01:10:28.030
- I'm sorry. - You hit his lower back.

1930
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.370
Was that your butt?

1931
01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.370
Why is your butt so low?

1932
01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:35.299
(His butt is too low.)

1933
01:10:35.299 --> 01:10:36.870
You hit my tailbone.

1934
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:38.610
(Team Senior Yu is having fun.)

1935
01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:40.379
- We're here. - I said it's So Min.

1936
01:10:40.379 --> 01:10:42.309
We're here. Is this the oldest building?

1937
01:10:42.309 --> 01:10:43.879
(It's finally time to go head-to-head.)

1938
01:10:43.879 --> 01:10:45.509
- Let's go. - Aren't they here already?

1939
01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:46.620
- Are they here? - There.

1940
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:47.980
- They're here. - No.

1941
01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:49.249
No, they're not here.

1942
01:10:49.349 --> 01:10:51.919
- Isn't that Jae Seok? - No, it's not him.

1943
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:53.219
I thought it was here.

1944
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.620
- They're here. - It's them.

1945
01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.389
- It won't work. - We have to block it.

1946
01:10:56.389 --> 01:10:57.860
They're here.

1947
01:10:58.259 --> 01:11:00.059
- What do we do? - Hey.

1948
01:11:00.129 --> 01:11:02.129
Jong Kook, go to the back. Hold on.

1949
01:11:02.129 --> 01:11:03.830
(Team Junior Jee walks into the tiger's den.)

1950
01:11:04.599 --> 01:11:07.669
(Jong Kook hides in the back to make a surprise attack.)

1951
01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.740
Hide.

1952
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:13.179
(So Min hides as well because she might be the target.)

1953
01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.410
- They're here. - They're inside.

1954
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:17.709
(They're determined.)

1955
01:11:18.849 --> 01:11:20.919
(Everybody will think we'll lose.)

1956
01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.950
(They're plotting an ending that's against everyone's expectation.)

1957
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:27.459
(Let's turn this around.)

1958
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:28.959
- Where are they? - Let's go, Se Chan.

1959
01:11:29.259 --> 01:11:30.330
Where are you going?

1960
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:31.589
- Jong Kook. - Hey.

1961
01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.530
Jong Kook.

1962
01:11:34.059 --> 01:11:35.160
Come back.

1963
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.400
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan betray them first.)

1964
01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.530
Jong Kook.

1965
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.169
- Get away. - Run away, Jong Kook.

1966
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.540
(Get away, Jong Kook.)

1967
01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.910
- Get away. - Run away, Jong Kook.

1968
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:47.280
Why should he run away?

1969
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.610
- Be careful, Jong Kook. - Wait.

1970
01:11:49.849 --> 01:11:51.150
It's Jong Kook.

1971
01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.749
Run away, Jong Kook.

1972
01:11:52.849 --> 01:11:55.280
Jong Kook, they set you up.

1973
01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.320
- What are they doing? - I don't know.

1974
01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320
(They're confused.)

1975
01:11:58.349 --> 01:11:59.620
Get away, Jong Kook.

1976
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.020
(Why are they telling me to get away?)

1977
01:12:03.759 --> 01:12:04.790
(Where did he go?)

1978
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:06.730
- What's going on? - What's all this?

1979
01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.129
Come here, Seok Jin.

1980
01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:10.870
(Team Senior Yu is confused about this strategy.)

1981
01:12:12.099 --> 01:12:13.839
- You're going to rip my name tag. - What?

1982
01:12:13.839 --> 01:12:15.270
- You're going to rip mine. - Why would we rip yours?

1983
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:16.570
It's not you. Why would we rip yours?

1984
01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:18.709
Who is it?

1985
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:20.280
It's not you. Why would we rip yours?

1986
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.709
It's not me.

1987
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:23.980
(Jong Kook is watching everything.)

1988
01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.919
- I swear I'm not lying. - Seok Jin.

1989
01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:30.089
(What? They made eye contacts.)

1990
01:12:30.089 --> 01:12:31.820
It's Jong Kook.

1991
01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.790
(They find Jong Kook alone and unite again.)

1992
01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:37.889
(Why are they coming here?)

1993
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:39.059
He's here.

1994
01:12:39.059 --> 01:12:40.200
(Eliminate his name tag.)

1995
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.700
Hey, rip his name tag.

1996
01:12:42.129 --> 01:12:43.299
Rip his name tag.

1997
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:45.629
Seok Jin.

1998
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:47.799
(This is strange.)

1999
01:12:47.799 --> 01:12:48.940
Is it me?

2000
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:52.270
- Jong Kook. - It might be you.

2001
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:54.509
- No, hold on to So Min. - It's not her.

2002
01:12:54.509 --> 01:12:56.150
(Team Senior Yu is confused by the other team's strategy.)

2003
01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:58.110
- Hold on. Kwang Soo. - There he is.

2004
01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:00.219
(This is our chance.)

2005
01:13:00.379 --> 01:13:01.520
Jong Kook.

2006
01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.650
(They get a head start thanks to the unplanned strategy.)

2007
01:13:05.389 --> 01:13:09.259
(Team Junior Jee surrounds the opponents with great force.)

2008
01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:11.389
- Jong Kook. - No, hold on to So Min.

2009
01:13:11.589 --> 01:13:13.360
- It's not me? - It's not you.

2010
01:13:13.999 --> 01:13:15.929
- Hold on. - Be careful.

2011
01:13:17.129 --> 01:13:20.200
(Team Senior Yu protects So Min, )

2012
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.910
(and Jong Kook is all alone.)

2013
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.080
(If they all attack Jong Kook, they can turn this around.)

2014
01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.580
Let's run at So Min. Jong Kook will try to block us, right?

2015
01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:32.849
Let's rip his name tag then.

2016
01:13:32.919 --> 01:13:35.450
- I'll do it. - Wait.

2017
01:13:36.249 --> 01:13:37.620
I'll do it.

2018
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.849
(Seok Jin steps up as the team leader.)

2019
01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:40.320
- You're going to rip mine. - Why would we rip yours?

2020
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.759
(If he's not the target, he won't be eliminated.)

2021
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.129
(Seok Jin steps up and distracts them.)

2022
01:13:47.129 --> 01:13:48.230
Don't come.

2023
01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:49.570
- Go. Let's go. - Don't come.

2024
01:13:49.969 --> 01:13:51.929
(Seok Jin gets in between Jong Kook and Haha.)

2025
01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:54.169
(This is their chance.)

2026
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:57.009
- Don't come. - We told you.

2027
01:13:57.009 --> 01:13:58.270
Go. Let's go.

2028
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:01.809
(Will Seok Jin's plan succeed?)

2029
01:14:04.009 --> 01:14:05.379
(What?)

2030
01:14:05.379 --> 01:14:06.749
(Ripping)

2031
01:14:06.749 --> 01:14:08.520
- Go. Let's go. - Don't come.

2032
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.589
(What?)

2033
01:14:09.589 --> 01:14:11.790
(What's going on?)

2034
01:14:12.559 --> 01:14:13.559
(What happened?)

2035
01:14:13.559 --> 01:14:14.759
What just happened?

2036
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.660
(Why did Seok Jin get eliminated?)

2037
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.089
(That means...)

2038
01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:21.830
(This morning, they were choosing the target.)

2039
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:24.169
(Team Senior Yu's target was Seok Jin.)

2040
01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:25.400
This is interesting.

2041
01:14:26.099 --> 01:14:27.200
(It was me?)

2042
01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.370
What were you doing?

2043
01:14:29.139 --> 01:14:31.469
- That's not how you do this. - Why did you do that?

2044
01:14:31.809 --> 01:14:33.509
This is so not fun. What was that?

2045
01:14:33.509 --> 01:14:35.009
This isn't fun at all.

2046
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.450
- What are you doing? - What did you do?

2047
01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:39.450
What just happened?

2048
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:41.020
Why did he come?

2049
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.690
- Why did you do that? - Why did you do that for?

2050
01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:44.450
Did you overestimate yourself? Why did you do that?

2051
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:45.990
I thought it wasn't me.

2052
01:14:46.389 --> 01:14:48.620
- I didn't think it was me at all. - Why not?

2053
01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.559
I just thought it wasn't me.

2054
01:14:50.559 --> 01:14:53.499
Why did he hit the empty can last week?

2055
01:14:54.129 --> 01:14:55.999
Why do you keep ruining the plan?

2056
01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.429
Then,

2057
01:14:58.429 --> 01:14:59.799
should we give you a chance?

2058
01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:01.940
(They lost, but this is not the end.)

2059
01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.070
(They can switch one team member.)

2060
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:06.139
The winning team can save one person from the losing team.

2061
01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.639
- Then, should we give you a chance? - Yes.

2062
01:15:08.639 --> 01:15:10.480
Let's go to the torturing equipment.

2063
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.349
Let's go to the torturing equipment.

2064
01:15:12.349 --> 01:15:13.980
(Dashing)

2065
01:15:14.249 --> 01:15:15.650
(This is their last chance to avoid sleeping at the ice rink.)

2066
01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:18.389
We'll time you from now on.

2067
01:15:18.690 --> 01:15:21.520
(I'll twist his legs.)

2068
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.030
- You can take turns. - I'll do one person at a time.

2069
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:25.530
- You can take turns. - It's one person at a time.

2070
01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:26.929
We knew this would happen,

2071
01:15:26.929 --> 01:15:29.669
so we prepared for this.

2072
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:31.400
- Let's time this. - Okay.

2073
01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.200
It's how long you can resist, right?

2074
01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.570
- Cross your legs. - Okay.

2075
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:36.169
- Like this? I'll resist. - Yes.

2076
01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:37.639
You can't ask for a time out.

2077
01:15:37.639 --> 01:15:39.240
Get set, go.

2078
01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.940
(Groaning)

2079
01:15:42.009 --> 01:15:43.679
(He's done.)

2080
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.309
It's over.

2081
01:15:45.309 --> 01:15:46.719
(He feels the electricity.)

2082
01:15:46.879 --> 01:15:48.020
Two seconds.

2083
01:15:48.749 --> 01:15:50.749
That was two seconds. That was long.

2084
01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:52.959
I'm in first place right now.

2085
01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.059
This will take forever,

2086
01:15:56.059 --> 01:15:58.030
so let's go to a different one.

2087
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.429
Should we move on?

2088
01:16:01.429 --> 01:16:03.700
Let's see how many hits they can take.

2089
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.969
In a row? Okay.

2090
01:16:04.969 --> 01:16:06.070
(He clenches his teeth.)

2091
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:07.200
I'm ready.

2092
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:10.509
- Would you be okay? - Yes.

2093
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:11.740
Here's one.

2094
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:17.849
(Shaking)

2095
01:16:19.379 --> 01:16:21.150
- He lasted. - He did.

2096
01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:22.589
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay.

2097
01:16:22.589 --> 01:16:24.889
- Here's two. - He's resisting.

2098
01:16:24.889 --> 01:16:27.120
- Yes. - Here's two.

2099
01:16:31.889 --> 01:16:34.099
(It's painful.)

2100
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.030
Wait. What's wrong? Why are you sitting?

2101
01:16:37.169 --> 01:16:38.799
Jae Seok.

2102
01:16:38.799 --> 01:16:40.669
- What? - You're so funny.

2103
01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:42.969
Who are you to hit him?

2104
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.839
- Jae Seok, - I mean...

2105
01:16:44.839 --> 01:16:46.839
we're not going to use this to make our decision.

2106
01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:48.940
(We're not going to use this to make our decision.)

2107
01:16:49.179 --> 01:16:50.650
- What? - Let's edit this out.

2108
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:51.709
- Okay. - You're going to edit this out?

2109
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:53.980
That was too violent.

2110
01:16:53.980 --> 01:17:01.389
We need to decide who will survive and who will sleep at the ice rink.

2111
01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.690
Let's go to the hotel and finish off.

2112
01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:05.389
He must be disappointed.

2113
01:17:05.389 --> 01:17:06.599
Hold on.

2114
01:17:06.599 --> 01:17:07.860
We'll do it too.

2115
01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.129
We won't pick the person who doesn't scream.

2116
01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:10.929
- I'm serious. - Let's decide when we get there.

2117
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:13.740
Let's decide when we get there. Don't do it here.

2118
01:17:13.999 --> 01:17:15.070
It's you for sure.

2119
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:16.969
(You're sleeping outside.)

2120
01:17:16.969 --> 01:17:18.870
- It's you. - Fine.

2121
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.139
- We'll sleep together. - Let's do this.

2122
01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:23.110
Let's do this. This is good.

2123
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:24.650
- We'll sleep together. - Good.

2124
01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:26.950
- Okay. - You'll sleep outside,

2125
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:28.480
and you'll freeze.

2126
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.889
- Good plan. - Good.

2127
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:35.620
(Darkness falls in the outdoor ice rink.)

2128
01:17:36.259 --> 01:17:38.160
This is entirely outdoors.

2129
01:17:39.299 --> 01:17:41.129
(There are three small tents on the ice rink.)

2130
01:17:41.129 --> 01:17:42.629
It's so small.

2131
01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:45.870
This is just the ground.

2132
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:46.940
(There are sleeping bags for a comfortable rest.)

2133
01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.969
I heard it's getting cold tonight.

2134
01:17:48.969 --> 01:17:51.110
It's really cold.

2135
01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.179
Team Senior Yu is the winner,

2136
01:17:53.179 --> 01:17:55.309
so you'll be sleeping in luxurious suite rooms.

2137
01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.749
(The winners will get a comfortable rest...)

2138
01:17:56.749 --> 01:18:00.620
(in the elegant, luxurious suite rooms.)

2139
01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.820
(Welcome, Team Senior Yu.)

2140
01:18:04.849 --> 01:18:07.160
The losing team...

2141
01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.259
- will sleep on the ice rink. - We're sleeping here?

2142
01:18:08.259 --> 01:18:09.429
This isn't good.

2143
01:18:09.429 --> 01:18:11.089
You can't sleep here.

2144
01:18:11.089 --> 01:18:12.089
(How are you supposed to sleep here?)

2145
01:18:12.089 --> 01:18:13.730
Before that, there will be a change of fates...

2146
01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:15.629
between the flowery road and the icy road.

2147
01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:16.870
This is important.

2148
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:17.929
(One person from each team will switch where they sleep.)

2149
01:18:17.929 --> 01:18:18.969
This isn't possible.

2150
01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.540
First of all, the winning team...

2151
01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.669
will choose one person they'd like to save...

2152
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:24.870
from the losing team.

2153
01:18:25.009 --> 01:18:28.540
(Which lucky person will sleep in the suite room?)

2154
01:18:28.679 --> 01:18:31.150
It's Team Junior Jee,

2155
01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:33.349
so Seok Jin has to be there.

2156
01:18:33.349 --> 01:18:35.679
We want Seok Jin to stay here,

2157
01:18:35.679 --> 01:18:38.620
and Kwang Soo has no reason to be here.

2158
01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.860
- I agree. - We gave you a chance.

2159
01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:41.889
(We saw you in Gwandeogjeong Pavilion.)

2160
01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:44.860
- We gave you a chance and you lied. - You lied.

2161
01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:47.499
You two can choose A, B, or C.

2162
01:18:47.499 --> 01:18:48.530
- I want the middle. - I want B.

2163
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:50.030
I want the middle.

2164
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:53.740
Get out. Both of you, get out.

2165
01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.910
- It's either one of them. - Let's see who sleeps in C.

2166
01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.809
- Feeling! Intuition! Cross! - Feeling! Intuition! Cross!

2167
01:19:00.339 --> 01:19:02.610
We'll be in A and B. Come to C.

2168
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.480
I was going to...

2169
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.320
exclude Ji Hyo.

2170
01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:10.049
(She almost didn't get saved, )

2171
01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:12.320
(but what made Jae Seok change his mind?)

2172
01:19:12.889 --> 01:19:15.860
(On their way to Gwandeogjeong Pavilion)

2173
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.660
(Their destination was being kept a secret to avoid the other team.)

2174
01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:22.599
(Jong Kook guessed right.)

2175
01:19:22.599 --> 01:19:24.230
Are you going to the oldest building in Jeju Island?

2176
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:27.669
(How did Jong Kook guess right?)

2177
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.469
Ji Hyo said...

2178
01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:33.580
they're going to the oldest building.

2179
01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:34.839
(Come to the oldest building.)

2180
01:19:35.179 --> 01:19:39.820
(Ji Hyo was the one who provided the information.)

2181
01:19:40.179 --> 01:19:42.249
Come here, Ji Hyo.

2182
01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:43.290
You can sleep in the hotel.

2183
01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:44.990
(She betrayed her team, so she gets to sleep in the suite room.)

2184
01:19:45.349 --> 01:19:47.190
- Let's decide. - Yes.

2185
01:19:47.190 --> 01:19:48.889
We have to decide.

2186
01:19:48.889 --> 01:19:51.429
- Everybody, let's do this. - What?

2187
01:19:51.429 --> 01:19:55.129
The five of you can go to your hotel rooms,

2188
01:19:55.759 --> 01:19:58.200
- and you'll get a call. - They'll call us? That's cruel.

2189
01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.339
Should we go then?

2190
01:19:59.339 --> 01:20:00.440
(The person to get the call will come back down.)

2191
01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.940
- You know, I... - This is cruel.

2192
01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:04.540
Jae Seok is getting a call.

2193
01:20:04.809 --> 01:20:06.009
You got a call from Kwang Soo.

2194
01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.709
- Hello? - Come to C.

2195
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:09.709
(The decision has been made.)

2196
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:11.780
- We haven't started. - What?

2197
01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.480
- It's not yet? - We haven't started yet.

2198
01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.120
- We didn't start. - It's not yet.

2199
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.190
(They know who it is even before they start.)

2200
01:20:17.749 --> 01:20:19.959
This is nerve-wracking.

2201
01:20:20.259 --> 01:20:22.790
This is nerve-wracking. I really don't want to go.

2202
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:23.790
(Please don't let it be me.)

2203
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:26.030
Think about it. We won,

2204
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:29.099
so why does it feel like we lost?

2205
01:20:31.969 --> 01:20:33.499
What? Why am I getting a call?

2206
01:20:33.799 --> 01:20:35.669
(She gets a call from Seok Jin.)

2207
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:36.709
Yes, Seok Jin.

2208
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.139
Magnet human.

2209
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:40.910
(He's worried.)

2210
01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:43.709
(Pausing)

2211
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:45.349
I'm sorry for calling you.

2212
01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.950
Can you give the phone to Jong Kook?

2213
01:20:49.419 --> 01:20:50.650
Hold on.

2214
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:52.790
Me?

2215
01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.089
(That's right. Jong Kook was rude to Seok Jin.)

2216
01:20:57.089 --> 01:20:58.860
Yes. Hello?

2217
01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.160
(Yes. Hello?)

2218
01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.160
Yes.

2219
01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:02.469
Jong Kook.

2220
01:21:02.469 --> 01:21:04.700
- Yes. - I haven't heard that tone.

2221
01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.240
Can you keep being polite?

2222
01:21:06.469 --> 01:21:08.139
- Seok Jin. - Yes.

2223
01:21:08.139 --> 01:21:10.309
I only did that because this is TV.

2224
01:21:11.339 --> 01:21:13.740
- Jong Kook. - Yes, Kwang Soo.

2225
01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.879
(He's so warm.)

2226
01:21:14.879 --> 01:21:16.709
We'll talk casually to you then.

2227
01:21:17.679 --> 01:21:18.980
Sure, go ahead.

2228
01:21:19.219 --> 01:21:20.219
(This is a different situation.)

2229
01:21:20.219 --> 01:21:21.280
You can talk casually.

2230
01:21:21.549 --> 01:21:22.549
Jong Kook.

2231
01:21:22.549 --> 01:21:24.049
- You have to be polite. - You can't do that.

2232
01:21:24.049 --> 01:21:26.120
Really? I'm sorry.

2233
01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.959
That was Se Chan.

2234
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.330
- I'm sorry. - He called you by your name.

2235
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:30.459
I'm sorry.

2236
01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.259
(I'm speechless.)

2237
01:21:32.259 --> 01:21:34.759
Was that Se Chan?

2238
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:38.070
I'm sorry.

2239
01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:40.639
I shouldn't have done that.

2240
01:21:40.639 --> 01:21:41.700
(You have to respect him still.)

2241
01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.440
We took a vote, and it was a unanimous decision.

2242
01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.509
(They got a unanimous vote for the person sleeping on the rink?)

2243
01:21:46.509 --> 01:21:48.540
We took a vote, and it was a unanimous decision.

2244
01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.809
He got voted.

2245
01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.549
(Somebody got voted.)

2246
01:21:56.690 --> 01:21:58.120
Should I pass it on?

2247
01:21:58.719 --> 01:22:01.719
(If it's not Jong Kook, is it 1 of the other 3?)

2248
01:22:01.719 --> 01:22:02.790
Yes.

2249
01:22:03.759 --> 01:22:04.759
Okay.

2250
01:22:05.559 --> 01:22:06.799
I'll pass it on. Hold on.

2251
01:22:07.099 --> 01:22:09.370
(He's uneasy.)

2252
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.099
What?

2253
01:22:15.099 --> 01:22:16.440
(Is it really me?)

2254
01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.440
What?

2255
01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:18.839
Go.

2256
01:22:18.839 --> 01:22:20.209
- Hold on. - Sorry.

2257
01:22:20.209 --> 01:22:21.280
(Do I get to stay?)

2258
01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.709
I got a special order.

2259
01:22:23.049 --> 01:22:24.809
Where?

2260
01:22:24.809 --> 01:22:27.080
- Really? - I got a special order.

2261
01:22:27.179 --> 01:22:29.120
I'm sorry.

2262
01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.150
- Really? - Yes.

2263
01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:32.419
- What? Am I safe? - Really?

2264
01:22:32.419 --> 01:22:33.459
Jae Seok.

2265
01:22:35.259 --> 01:22:36.389
Follow me.

2266
01:22:36.389 --> 01:22:37.589
Jong Kook.

2267
01:22:37.589 --> 01:22:38.589
(Jong Kook, please say it's not me.)

2268
01:22:38.589 --> 01:22:40.759
- What? - Jong Kook.

2269
01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:43.570
(Come here, So Min.)

2270
01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:44.629
What?

2271
01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900
Jong Kook.

2272
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:49.139
(Haha is left alone, and he's dazed.)

2273
01:22:49.139 --> 01:22:50.709
Hold on.

2274
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:52.709
- I'll take this. - He's getting a call.

2275
01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:57.309
He's getting a call, so let's leave.

2276
01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.879
I didn't know I'd be saved.

2277
01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.049
Hello?

2278
01:23:01.049 --> 01:23:02.150
- Haha. - Hello?

2279
01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:04.650
Where are you?

2280
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:06.160
I got left alone.

2281
01:23:07.259 --> 01:23:09.690
Haha, why aren't you coming down?

2282
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:14.200
We'll make it clear. In 1, 2, 3.

2283
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.360
- Haha. - Haha.

2284
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.770
(We'll make it clear. In 1, 2, 3.)

2285
01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:17.770
(Haha)

2286
01:23:17.969 --> 01:23:19.599
You must be having fun. You're laughing.

2287
01:23:19.599 --> 01:23:20.599
In 1, 2, 3.

2288
01:23:20.599 --> 01:23:21.599
- Haha. - Haha.

2289
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:27.940
(They discussed about allocating tent C.)

2290
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.410
(Haha caused the discord in their team.)

2291
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:34.549
(They all agree to invite Haha who caused the discord.)

2292
01:23:35.889 --> 01:23:37.190
Let's get going.

2293
01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:38.249
(No, the ice rink.)

2294
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:42.759
This feels like a dream. It feels like I'm dreaming.

2295
01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.830
(His 30 minutes in the suite room is up.)

2296
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:47.929
Haha, who do you want to sleep with?

2297
01:23:48.429 --> 01:23:49.900
My gosh.

2298
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:53.339
This is too cozy.

2299
01:23:55.339 --> 01:23:57.440
Is this the outside?

2300
01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.339
- Hurry up. Go in. - Haha.

2301
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.110
- It's shaking in the wind. - How do we...

2302
01:24:03.179 --> 01:24:04.580
This is insane.

2303
01:24:05.009 --> 01:24:06.950
Everybody, good night.

2304
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:08.620
We'll go now.

2305
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.419
I'm so mad!

2306
01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.990
- Everybody, - In the morning...

2307
01:24:13.559 --> 01:24:14.589
have a sweet dream.

2308
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:17.259
Sleep tight.

2309
01:24:17.490 --> 01:24:18.959
Good night.

2310
01:24:18.959 --> 01:24:20.160
Good night.

2311
01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.200
(They stayed warm together and fell asleep.)
