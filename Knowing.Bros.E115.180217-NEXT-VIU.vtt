00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.252
(Cheering)

6
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:29.021

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.989
- You are so funny. - It was a magical entrance.

9
00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.559
(He feels proud of the entrance he made.)

10
00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:38.459
Hello, everyone. We hope...

11
00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:41.169
this film contest can show Korea's best authority and tradition.

12
00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:43.198
It's Brother School Film Contest.

13
00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:44.739
We are tonight's hosts. I am Lee Sang Min.

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:46.099

- Nice to see you all. - Good to see you.

16
00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.679
It's a film contest that we were not in.

17
00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.309
I wonder if this was necessary...

18
00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.609
to make this set looking so awesome.

19
00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:57.618
Just for the rest of members?

20
00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.249
Actually,

21
00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.948
it cost a lot to put this red carpet just for us.

22
00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:04.158
It would be a waste to just throw it away...

23
00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:05.919
after we use this tonight.

24
00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:08.889
This set was even designed by producer Choi Chang Soo.

25
00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:09.988
Really?

26
00:01:09.988 --> 00:01:12.958
So let's use this red carpet again at your wedding.

27
00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.899
For groom and bride's entrance.

28
00:01:15.128 --> 00:01:16.568
Why don't you two also get married when he gets married?

29
00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:18.738
So that you guys can get married at once.

30
00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:20.199
(Turning)

31
00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:23.708
I heard that you are learning Taekwondo these days.

32
00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:25.639
I didn't know you could be fast.

33
00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:26.678
(He became much faster than before.)

34
00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:29.348

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.598
They made the whole set for this show.

68
00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:56.869
Exactly.

69
00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.399
I was so surprised.

70
00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.769
We have a pose we make.

71
00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:02.908
What are they doing?

72
00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:04.709
What are they doing?

73
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:06.108
What does this pose mean?

74
00:03:06.108 --> 00:03:07.309
Can I?

75
00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.179
Our hands cannot be met.

76
00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:10.619
Can I?

77
00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:11.679
(Their hands can't be met.)

78
00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.179
- We will call the next team. - Shall we go?

79
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.788
Thank you.

80

- We showed everything we got. - Bye.

81
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.559
- I will ruin the show. - Come now.

82
00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.158
They can't do this to us.

83
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:23.799
- Can I? - This is the last team.

84
00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.829
- He went to music industry... - Gosh.

85
00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.799
- Call my name now. - Because...

86
00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.938
Okja is waiting for us.

87
00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:33.969
Okja?

88
00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:35.209
(Surprised)

89
00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.108
He is a strong rookie.

90
00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:38.309
He surely is,

91
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:40.108
Rookie singer Kang Ho Dong,

92
00:03:40.478 --> 00:03:42.579

93

95
00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.288
- There is one more person. - And...

96
00:03:50.358 --> 00:03:53.489

Welcome.

100
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.128
- What did he say? - "Are you all surprised?"

101
00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:01.829
(Kang Ho Dong, Hong Jin Young, Yoo Sae Yoon, and Jo Hye Ryun)

102
00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.299
- Gosh. - Welcome.

103
00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.969
(Kang Ho Dong, Hong Jin Young, Yoo Sae Yoon, and Jo Hye Ryun)

104
00:04:07.668 --> 00:04:09.608
They are here. Jo Hye Ryun,

105
00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.079
Hong Jin Young, Yoo Sae Yoon, and singer Kang Ho Dong.

106
00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:17.178
Jo Hye Ryun is also an investor of this music video.

107
00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.949
Gosh.

108
00:04:20.418 --> 00:04:21.449
They are funny.

109
00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:25.488
Make a pose.

110
00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:26.788
Why did he throw that?

111
00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:29.259
It's hers. It's my stylist's fur jacket.

112
00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.298
Pick that up now.

113
00:04:31.798 --> 00:04:34.769
She said it's very expensive. I am in trouble. Bring it now.

114
00:04:35.098 --> 00:04:38.038
He is in trouble.

115
00:04:38.798 --> 00:04:41.639
- Shake off the dust. - What is he doing?

116
00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.668
Okja.

117
00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.108
Why are you calling him Okja?

118
00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:48.248
They fought.

119
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:50.548
- That's enough. - Please take your seats.

120
00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:52.219
- Please take your seats. - What about an interview?

121
00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.348
- There is no such thing. - We won't interview you.

122
00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:55.449
- Why not? - Maybe later.

123
00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.488
Let's go then.

124
00:04:56.488 --> 00:04:58.589
- Let's go. - We shouldn't have gone first.

125
00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.089
It didn't go well.

126
00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:03.029
This is not the end.

127
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.098
There is something better. Other than them,

128
00:05:06.228 --> 00:05:09.829
- the famous actors are here too. - They are here.

129
00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:14.108
The weakest team is Yeong Cheol's team.

130
00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:17.139
- Are we the weakest? - I joined their team.

131
00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.408
And is the team even weaker now?

132
00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:20.308
(He is lost for words.)

133
00:05:20.308 --> 00:05:22.248
- Bingo. - Bingo.

134
00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:25.178
- They are the weakest. - We gave up on our wants.

135
00:05:25.178 --> 00:05:28.689
We had many scenes to work on. We had a lot of free time too.

136
00:05:29.618 --> 00:05:30.889
(Talk faster.)

137
00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:31.889
Look at him.

138
00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:33.558
He goes well with the image.

139
00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:36.259
- He is a rookie. - He surely is Okja.

140
00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.858
- He is not scared at all. - He does look like it.

141
00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:39.598
- He is not scared. - He doesn't look like a rookie.

142
00:05:39.658 --> 00:05:42.228
- Let's move on. - Okay.

143
00:05:42.228 --> 00:05:43.939
Jang Hoon, please explain to us.

144
00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:47.439
There are three candidate teams.

145
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.408
From "N" website,

146
00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.279
we had an early voting.

147
00:05:51.408 --> 00:05:55.009
We also have a real time voting too.

148
00:05:55.108 --> 00:05:58.348
We will add both results.

149
00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.389
According to the results, there will be a winning team.

150
00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.959
We will show the viewers the full music video of the winning team.

151
00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:06.158
This is important.

152
00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:07.488
They will be given this honor.

153
00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:10.058
It will be a great chance to promote your song.

154
00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:11.329
The rest teams...

155
00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:13.829
will only get to show a little bit of their music videos.

156
00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:15.368
This is an honor.

157
00:06:15.368 --> 00:06:19.738
For those of you who don't know which team to vote,

158
00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:22.038
they will introduce themselves.

159
00:06:22.038 --> 00:06:23.808
First team is Team Coward of the Universe.

160
00:06:23.808 --> 00:06:26.779
We are Team Coward of the Universe.

161
00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.348
It's been a year and three months.

162
00:06:28.348 --> 00:06:30.048
- Already? - It's been so long.

163
00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:32.379
I wrote lyrics for "Sweet Dream".

164
00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.149
This time Kyung Hoon wrote lyrics for the newest song.

165
00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:38.158
And we wanted to film our music video properly.

166
00:06:38.158 --> 00:06:39.719
That's why we have Shin Dong as our music video director.

167
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.689
He is a chubby music video director.

168
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.498
Director Shin Dong,

169
00:06:45.558 --> 00:06:47.928
you are quiet today.

170
00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.569
It's because he is wearing braces.

171
00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.069
(He is wearing braces.)

172
00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.399
He needs to wear the braces.

173
00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.509
Are you okay to talk?

174
00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:55.538
Well...

175
00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:59.339
We tried to make their music video like a movie.

176
00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:01.408
It's called "Aftereffect".

177
00:07:01.548 --> 00:07:03.149
He'll have trouble being on shows.

178
00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.248
We've made a very sad music video.

179
00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:09.788
Please look forward to our music video. Vote for us.

180
00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:11.689
(Embarrassed)

181
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.058
We are number one.

182
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.658
Not number 2. We are number 1.

183
00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:16.788
- Team number 1. - Team number 1.

184
00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:18.998
- Next. - Hello. It's my...

185
00:07:18.998 --> 00:07:21.899
third single, as you all know.

186
00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:23.469
It's called "Can I?"

187
00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:25.538
That's right. It's been made with me, Song Eun I.

188
00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:29.038
We've aimed the age group that watches this show.

189
00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.779
We have aimed the elementary school children.

190
00:07:33.408 --> 00:07:34.808
(They even targeted a certain age group.)

191
00:07:34.808 --> 00:07:36.379
- Please enjoy. - But officially...

192
00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.079
Director Song, this show is for over 15-year old.

193
00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:41.118
You can't say that because this show is mainly for people...

194
00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:43.248
who are over 15 years old.

195
00:07:43.618 --> 00:07:44.858
I didn't know that.

196
00:07:45.058 --> 00:07:46.459
- They won't watch this. - I didn't know about this.

197
00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:49.788
There are so many elementary school kids in the country.

198
00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:51.199
We aimed teenagers.

199
00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:55.428
Our music video will make the most of teenagers laugh.

200
00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.798
It's a comic hero music video.

201
00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.509
There is one important scene.

202
00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:05.408
If you want to watch that, please vote for us. We are number two.

203
00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:07.279
- We are team number two. - Gosh.

204
00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:09.908
- Are you all understood? - What are you guys doing?

205
00:08:09.908 --> 00:08:12.118
Is this a perspective?

206
00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.519
The third person is so huge.

207
00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:16.248
- He is so huge. - It's...

208
00:08:16.248 --> 00:08:17.719
The person in the front is huge for real.

209
00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:20.629
Actually, I was at the music video set.

210
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:23.358
I've watched the whole thing.

211
00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:25.759
I can assure that it is made with high quality.

212
00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:27.469
Can you all vote...

213
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:28.769
for team number two?

214
00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:30.699
Probably not.

215
00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:32.799
All right.

216
00:08:33.398 --> 00:08:35.809
This is the last team.

217
00:08:35.868 --> 00:08:37.339
This is the last team.

218
00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:40.039
He lives in Gangnam.

219
00:08:40.248 --> 00:08:43.378
There is only 1 bus in his area. It's bus number 3.

220
00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:44.949
Team number three.

221
00:08:45.148 --> 00:08:46.348
Hello.

222
00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:47.748
Kang Ho Dong.

223
00:08:47.988 --> 00:08:49.348
- Kang Ho Dong. - Kang Ho Dong.

224
00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:52.219
- A white pig Kang Ho Dong. - A white pig Kang Ho Dong.

225
00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:53.858
(He introduced himself in a cute way.)

226
00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:56.728
I am back as a rookie singer. I am Kang Ho Dong.

227
00:08:56.898 --> 00:08:59.299
I love you Okja.

228
00:09:01.429 --> 00:09:02.799
Please introduce yourselves.

229
00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:05.199
I can promise you all this.

230
00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:09.209
I am sure you have never seen a music video like ours.

231
00:09:09.439 --> 00:09:12.638
I am sure there are a lot of Jin Young's fans.

232
00:09:13.508 --> 00:09:14.648
Yes.

233
00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:18.018
She will show her amazing acting skills at the end.

234
00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:19.449
Then we will have to watch until the end.

235
00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:20.549
- So... - But...

236
00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:22.148
- Excuse me. - Is Hye Ryun in it?

237
00:09:22.148 --> 00:09:25.719
We've introduced Hye Ryun as the beautiful lady in the music video.

238
00:09:25.719 --> 00:09:26.988
That's right.

239
00:09:26.988 --> 00:09:28.528
You all like Hye Ryun, right?

240
00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:30.959
We put her in the first verse.

241
00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.559
(He did it to the full.)

242
00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:34.498
I only have to watch the first verse then.

243
00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:35.598
That's right.

244
00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:37.368
- In the first verse, - I don't need to watch the rest.

245
00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:39.569
we had to start the song with a bang.

246
00:09:39.638 --> 00:09:42.608
That's why we put Hye Ryun in the first verse.

247
00:09:42.768 --> 00:09:46.709
It will be your first time to see Ho Dong dancing too.

248
00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:47.709
Awesome.

249
00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:49.579
- We are team number 3. - Team number 3.

250
00:09:49.648 --> 00:09:50.919
He will show Okja dance.

251
00:09:51.018 --> 00:09:55.819
Okja, which team's music video are you most excited to watch?

252
00:09:56.018 --> 00:09:57.919
I am sure they all want their team's music video to win.

253
00:09:57.988 --> 00:10:00.488
- Let's move onto the next question. - Gosh.

254
00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:01.628
- Team number two. - All right.

255
00:10:01.628 --> 00:10:03.758
Tell us which team will be the weakest team.

256
00:10:03.758 --> 00:10:05.858
- Choose the weakest team. - That's right.

257
00:10:05.858 --> 00:10:08.199
- I think... - Do you have any team on mind?

258
00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:12.069
Eun I and Sae Yoon were actually...

259
00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:14.008
trained by Shin Dong.

260
00:10:14.768 --> 00:10:16.978
- Really? - Yes.

261
00:10:17.238 --> 00:10:18.778
Who was your music video director of Celeb Five?

262
00:10:18.778 --> 00:10:20.378
- It was Shin Dong. - Shin Dong was.

263
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:23.848
Who was the music video director of "Marry Man"?

264
00:10:24.878 --> 00:10:26.179
Gosh.

265
00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:27.289
He is amazing.

266
00:10:27.289 --> 00:10:28.319
He is.

267
00:10:28.319 --> 00:10:29.518
He is amazing.

268
00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:31.518
Even though you are wearing braces, please say something.

269
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:32.789
Shall I do that?

270
00:10:32.789 --> 00:10:34.228
- Please. - Actually,

271
00:10:35.258 --> 00:10:39.758
Sae Yoon asked me to help him with his newest music video.

272
00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:43.498
They are actually my customers.

273
00:10:43.498 --> 00:10:44.498
They are your weakest teams then.

274
00:10:44.498 --> 00:10:46.469
- I think... - We won't be that bad.

275
00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:48.138
- this contest feels a bit... - It bothers you.

276
00:10:48.138 --> 00:10:49.909
- It does. - Gosh.

277
00:10:50.138 --> 00:10:52.108
I won't expect to win this contest.

278
00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:54.108
But please vote for team number one.

279
00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:56.679
If you don't expect on winning, please let us win this contest.

280
00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:57.748
(She says it quickly.)

281
00:10:58.278 --> 00:10:59.919
- Please let us win. - Please.

282
00:11:00.049 --> 00:11:01.248
- We're desperate. - What do you think?

283
00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:02.618
- Who is the weakest team, Eun I? - Eun I?

284
00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:04.689
You will find out later.

285
00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:05.959
I will say something more.

286
00:11:06.018 --> 00:11:09.589
She launched "Confidential" and "Kim Saeng Min's Slips".

287
00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:12.728
And she even made Celeb Five. Her latest work is my song, "Can I?"

288
00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:13.728
Actually...

289
00:11:13.728 --> 00:11:16.169
I wasn't going to add your song into my profile though.

290
00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:19.969
- What? - It depends on the name of song.

291
00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:21.309
My back hurts.

292
00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:23.778
- Can I not just leave that out? - "Can I?"

293
00:11:23.778 --> 00:11:25.309
We will have to watch their video.

294
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:28.179
Let's see how they made their music videos.

295
00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:29.679
I can't wait.

296
00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:32.518
After hearing the introductions of their music videos,

297
00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:34.648
I can't wait to watch their music videos.

298
00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:36.689
- We will now... - They do their lines.

299
00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:38.858
watch how they made...

300
00:11:38.858 --> 00:11:39.919
- the music videos. - He just said that.

301
00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:41.559
- He just said that. - I just said that line.

302
00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.159
(He bites his lip.)

303
00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:45.858
All right. We will now watch team number one's...

304
00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:48.868
music video. Their director was Shin Dong.

305
00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:50.969
What is the other thing that we should know...

306
00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:52.098
- about your video? - There is none.

307
00:11:52.098 --> 00:11:53.569
Just watch it already.

308
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:55.069
- Just watch it. - Let's begin.

309
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:56.368
I thought he was going to play the music video.

310
00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:57.909
But he asked instead.

311
00:11:58.909 --> 00:12:01.309
Hee Chul wrote the scenario of the music video.

312
00:12:01.549 --> 00:12:02.709
Were you satisfied?

313
00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:05.648
- I was. - Okay then.

314
00:12:05.648 --> 00:12:07.748
Let's watch the music video of "Aftereffect".

315
00:12:07.748 --> 00:12:08.888
- now. - They are not in order.

316
00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:09.888
- Let's watch now. - They aren't good.

317
00:12:09.888 --> 00:12:11.689
- They aren't good. - They are funny though.

318
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.289
- It begins. - I don't even have a script.

319
00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:15.789
Why didn't you make a script for me?

320
00:12:15.789 --> 00:12:16.959
(Brother School Film Contest)

321
00:12:17.898 --> 00:12:20.898
(At a house in Jongno)

322
00:12:21.868 --> 00:12:25.439
(It's a place where they film music video of "Aftereffect".)

323
00:12:26.138 --> 00:12:28.238
They have great equipment.

324
00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:29.508
Isn't that way too expensive for your music video?

325
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:31.978
They even used that. It is expensive.

326
00:12:31.978 --> 00:12:33.648
We spent everything on the equipement.

327
00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:37.348
We asked them to go with a full shot.

328
00:12:37.348 --> 00:12:39.148
He looks charismatic.

329
00:12:39.148 --> 00:12:40.549
He really looks like a director.

330
00:12:41.289 --> 00:12:43.959
(He looks serious unlike other days.)

331
00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:45.518
What? It's snowing.

332
00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:48.888
(It will be snowing in Seoul.)

333
00:12:48.888 --> 00:12:50.398
(This doesn't feel good.)

334
00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:52.299
The weather was really bad.

335
00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:53.998
Really?

336
00:12:53.998 --> 00:12:55.398
It was raining and snowing.

337
00:12:55.898 --> 00:12:57.839
(Actress of the music video, Noh Ji Sun)

338
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.069
She is my student.

339
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.268
- Hello. - I made her debut.

340
00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:02.939
- She is my student. - Where is Mi Sun?

341
00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:05.108
- Mi Sun. - Hey.

342
00:13:05.378 --> 00:13:06.409
She is my mother in my music video.

343
00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:07.549
Hello.

344
00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:10.248
What is going on?

345
00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.248
You are funny.

346
00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:12.518
Hello.

347
00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:15.348
Is this going to be like music video contest or something?

348
00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:17.988
Ho Dong and Yeong Cheol are making their videos too.

349
00:13:18.219 --> 00:13:21.128
Ho Dong will be hard to beat. Jin Young is helping him.

350
00:13:21.128 --> 00:13:22.258
Not Jin Kyung?

351
00:13:22.728 --> 00:13:23.929
Why would she?

352
00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:27.429
Jin Kyung made Yeong Cheol's song.

353
00:13:27.628 --> 00:13:28.628
Do you mean Hong Jin Young?

354
00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:30.368
Jin Kyung made kimchi not the music video.

355
00:13:30.368 --> 00:13:31.839
Jin Young makes music.

356
00:13:31.969 --> 00:13:33.469
- Is she in it? - "Love Battery".

357
00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:36.209
Gosh.

358
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.309
- He still doesn't get it. - He is so confused.

359
00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:39.439
Didn't you know that?

360
00:13:39.508 --> 00:13:40.978
Why is he confused with Jin Kyung?

361
00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:42.549
He wrote the scenario.

362
00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:44.248
- Really? - I will explain about the story.

363
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:47.449
We are a family. We lost our father when we were kids.

364
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:50.118
Kyung Hoon is my younger brother and he is a fighter.

365
00:13:50.118 --> 00:13:52.289
She is close friends of mine and she is a homeschool teacher.

366
00:13:52.459 --> 00:13:55.858
I will hold up papers to Ji Sun.

367
00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:57.498
Wait. Okay. Here they are.

368
00:13:57.699 --> 00:14:00.628
- I brought my real wedding photos. - These are real.

369
00:14:00.628 --> 00:14:01.898
(Special appearance by Lee Bong Won as the dead father)

370
00:14:01.898 --> 00:14:03.569
She brought the real photos.

371
00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:06.039
I told him this morning.

372
00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:08.738
I didn't tell him that he's dead in the story.

373
00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:10.679
I just asked him if we can use his picture in the music video.

374
00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:13.179
He said yes, but he has no idea he's dead.

375
00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:14.909
My goodness.

376
00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:17.248
- He's dead. - He doesn't know he's dead.

377
00:14:18.319 --> 00:14:19.518
I called him.

378
00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:20.888
Shouldn't this be in black and white?

379
00:14:21.618 --> 00:14:23.348
Lee Sang Min will play the boss.

380
00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:25.258
He's usually assigned to such roles.

381
00:14:26.689 --> 00:14:28.829
It's similar to "Sweet Dream".

382
00:14:30.659 --> 00:14:33.598
But in reality, Lee Soo Geun is more like a boss.

383
00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:37.238
If we make Soo Geun the boss, the problem is...

384
00:14:37.238 --> 00:14:38.669
(He cannot be serious.)

385
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.439
that it's hard to be serious.

386
00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:43.579
Also, Jang Hoon is too tall.

387
00:14:43.709 --> 00:14:46.238
People like Jang Hoon are...

388
00:14:46.309 --> 00:14:48.049
the first to die in real life.

389
00:14:49.478 --> 00:14:50.618
- What? - She says you would die.

390
00:14:53.478 --> 00:14:55.589
The mom and Kyung Hoon would be startled.

391
00:14:55.888 --> 00:14:58.758
Then, you have to slap him in the face.

392
00:14:58.819 --> 00:14:59.819
Do I hit him for real?

393
00:14:59.819 --> 00:15:01.429
- No, just fake it. - We'll cut to the next shot.

394
00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:02.888
(No! You have to fake it!)

395
00:15:02.888 --> 00:15:04.128
Hey.

396
00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:05.559
She should hit you.

397
00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:08.028
- That would make it realistic. - It's probably better to do it.

398
00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:10.439
Don't moms usually hit you on the back?

399
00:15:10.498 --> 00:15:12.638
It hurts more with a rubber glove.

400
00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:13.809
- Really? - Yes.

401
00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:15.768
- Should we shoot the first scene? - Yes.

402
00:15:16.368 --> 00:15:18.508
It's so funny that we have the same hair.

403
00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:21.679
- My mom did it for me. - Your mom?

404
00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:24.148
- We're rolling. - Here we go.

405
00:15:24.148 --> 00:15:25.549
Give me an okay from the first take.

406
00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:27.888
- Be careful when you come out. - Okay.

407
00:15:28.118 --> 00:15:29.689
Here we go.

408
00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:31.059
Rolling.

409
00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:32.618
(Idiot Hee Chul is playing while Kyung Hoon looks after him.)

410
00:15:34.858 --> 00:15:36.559
Mom, look! I made this.

411
00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:39.699
- Are you having fun? - Look. There is smoke coming out.

412
00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:42.669
It's cold, Hee Chul. You'll catch a cold. Come inside.

413
00:15:42.969 --> 00:15:44.469
The video looks a lot different.

414
00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:46.268
- It's like a commercial. - The color is different.

415
00:15:46.398 --> 00:15:48.209
It's cheating to use that camera.

416
00:15:48.608 --> 00:15:49.768
(Worried)

417
00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:51.638
(Ji Sun is here for Hee Chul's lesson.)

418
00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:53.008
"You..."

419
00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:54.508
Ms. Noh!

420
00:15:54.508 --> 00:15:56.378
- Hello. - Hello.

421
00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:57.848
Ms. Noh, here.

422
00:15:57.848 --> 00:15:59.419
It's cold. Go inside.

423
00:15:59.419 --> 00:16:01.388
- Hello. - Hurry, Ms. Noh.

424
00:16:01.449 --> 00:16:03.919
- Take her inside. Okay. - I have to study.

425
00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:05.358
Why is the teacher...

426
00:16:06.358 --> 00:16:07.988
Why does the teacher look like a high school student?

427
00:16:07.988 --> 00:16:10.028
She's a high school student.

428
00:16:10.128 --> 00:16:12.929
- Could they all be idiots? - All of them should learn from her.

429
00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:15.368
Hee Chul just forced it.

430
00:16:15.368 --> 00:16:17.669
- She might not know anything. - I think she needs to learn more.

431
00:16:18.138 --> 00:16:19.398
Does she know a lot?

432
00:16:19.868 --> 00:16:23.709
(Kyung Hoon must show mixed emotions as he has a crush on Ji Sun.)

433
00:16:24.478 --> 00:16:26.238
(Glancing)

434
00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:31.378
- You're... - Why are you laughing?

435
00:16:31.378 --> 00:16:33.618
- Why are you laughing? - Your gaze is so uneasy.

436
00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.719
This is what it's like with the new generation.

437
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:37.858
Is Kyung Hoon playing an antagonist?

438
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:40.459
What kind of feeling are you trying to portray?

439
00:16:40.758 --> 00:16:42.888
- Is he the school bully? - No one can relate.

440
00:16:42.888 --> 00:16:45.429
Is Kyung Hoon a boss or something?

441
00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:48.768
It's raining. We have to hurry.

442
00:16:49.228 --> 00:16:51.539
(The rain started to fall hard.)

443
00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:54.039
(It's an unexpected situation.)

444
00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:55.069
Cut.

445
00:16:56.508 --> 00:16:58.179
Cut. Okay. Good.

446
00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:01.478
(Shin Dong is working hard even in the harsh weather.)

447
00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:02.949
- Let's go with this. - Good shot, good shot.

448
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:05.379
Our strength is that we shoot very fast.

449
00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:07.818
- Shin Dong is... - You're really fast.

450
00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:10.459
a celebrity too, so he only shoots the cuts we need.

451
00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:12.288
- I agree. - He hates being delayed.

452
00:17:12.588 --> 00:17:13.788
Scene 6, take 1.

453
00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:15.359
- It looks so pretty. - Action!

454
00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.798
- The weather helped us. - The skies helped you.

455
00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:20.058
- It makes it moody. - It was perfect.

456
00:17:20.058 --> 00:17:24.099
(Hee Chul and Ji Sun run into gangsters in an alley.)

457
00:17:27.469 --> 00:17:28.738
(Blocking)

458
00:17:29.869 --> 00:17:33.109
- They don't touch you these days. - They're wearing suits.

459
00:17:35.048 --> 00:17:38.679
(Hee Chul is acting like he's scared and doesn't know what to do.)

460
00:17:38.879 --> 00:17:39.879
Cut, okay.

461
00:17:40.949 --> 00:17:42.949
- We'll do it from the other side. - Your face was excellent.

462
00:17:42.949 --> 00:17:43.988
(Shin Dong is satisfied.)

463
00:17:44.288 --> 00:17:45.389
I'm used...

464
00:17:45.588 --> 00:17:47.659
to getting hit...

465
00:17:47.758 --> 00:17:49.889
by Ho Dong in the waiting room.

466
00:17:49.889 --> 00:17:51.599
I tried to remember those times.

467
00:17:51.828 --> 00:17:54.929
I thought of Ho Dong while I was shooting.

468
00:17:54.929 --> 00:17:56.369
I don't need a microphone here.

469
00:17:56.369 --> 00:17:57.538
We're recording sound simultaneously.

470
00:17:58.139 --> 00:17:59.169
We'll go.

471
00:17:59.998 --> 00:18:01.008
Action!

472
00:18:03.008 --> 00:18:04.778
(He's giving his all to tumble and fall.)

473
00:18:05.238 --> 00:18:07.548
(Actual footage from the shoot)

474
00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:21.929
(He must keep his emotions constant during a long take.)

475
00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:39.679
You're so good!

476
00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:40.949
It's Kim Byung Ok.

477
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:43.919
Who?

478
00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:46.949
- Kim Byung Ok. - I was wondering what it was.

479
00:18:46.988 --> 00:18:49.818
- Kim Byung Ok. - I was wondering where it was from.

480
00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:51.359
(Marveling)

481
00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:54.159
I almost cried while looking at the camera.

482
00:18:54.859 --> 00:18:56.028
(Hee Chul is putting up an excellent performance.)

483
00:18:56.028 --> 00:18:57.728
We'll take a full shot of the same thing.

484
00:18:59.129 --> 00:19:01.768
This is Sang Min's first appearance.

485
00:19:02.869 --> 00:19:04.738
We should have made him take off that hat!

486
00:19:04.738 --> 00:19:06.699
I took it off starting from the next cut.

487
00:19:06.768 --> 00:19:08.008
You look like Lee Deok Hwa in that fishing show.

488
00:19:08.008 --> 00:19:09.969
(Are you Lee Deok Hwa?)

489
00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:11.538
Is this music video low budget?

490
00:19:12.008 --> 00:19:13.748
- Yes, it's low budget. - You look like a realtor.

491
00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:14.978
The lighting is...

492
00:19:15.349 --> 00:19:17.919
That? I did that on purpose.

493
00:19:18.318 --> 00:19:19.649
(Giggling)

494
00:19:20.649 --> 00:19:22.548
Okay. Rolling.

495
00:19:23.389 --> 00:19:24.689
Kyung Hoon, in!

496
00:19:24.689 --> 00:19:27.659
(Sang Min suggests Kyung Hoon to return back to their gang.)

497
00:19:27.659 --> 00:19:29.429
Sang Min, in!

498
00:19:32.758 --> 00:19:34.399
(He's asking for a handshake.)

499
00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:36.028
You should have played scissors.

500
00:19:39.068 --> 00:19:43.139
(Sang Min is ordering his underling before leaving.)

501
00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:47.109
Those legs look amazing.

502
00:19:47.278 --> 00:19:50.008
Okay. We'll go straight in.

503
00:19:50.248 --> 00:19:52.748
It looks professional. It does.

504
00:19:53.788 --> 00:19:56.119
I have to say, "What are you talking about?"

505
00:19:56.189 --> 00:19:57.758
Then you slap his face.

506
00:19:58.558 --> 00:19:59.919
Let's see. Like this.

507
00:20:00.558 --> 00:20:01.959
No. Here.

508
00:20:02.788 --> 00:20:04.929
We'll cut and shoot again,

509
00:20:04.929 --> 00:20:05.929
so don't worry.

510
00:20:06.228 --> 00:20:07.568
(Laughing)

511
00:20:07.629 --> 00:20:08.869
I'm scared...

512
00:20:10.738 --> 00:20:13.969
What happened? What happened to you?

513
00:20:13.969 --> 00:20:15.008
Let me see.

514
00:20:15.738 --> 00:20:17.008
I said, let me see.

515
00:20:17.578 --> 00:20:18.679
(He can't stop laughing.)

516
00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:20.778
- This is too funny. - Are you getting beat up?

517
00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:23.349
Are you stupid?

518
00:20:23.649 --> 00:20:24.849
I said, are you stupid?

519
00:20:26.778 --> 00:20:28.588
(He is acting passionately.)

520
00:20:28.649 --> 00:20:29.748
"Are you stupid?"

521
00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:31.518
"He is not my father."

522
00:20:31.518 --> 00:20:32.988
I said, are you stupid?

523
00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:34.588
Are you really going to shoot like this?

524
00:20:34.889 --> 00:20:35.929
Hold on.

525
00:20:37.629 --> 00:20:40.629
You little! How dare you!

526
00:20:40.629 --> 00:20:42.169
(She is getting mad at his horrible acting.)

527
00:20:42.629 --> 00:20:43.738
I'm scared.

528
00:20:44.169 --> 00:20:45.238
- We'll start. - Okay.

529
00:20:45.238 --> 00:20:47.669
(After a long time has passed...)

530
00:20:47.869 --> 00:20:48.909
Cut 1, take 4.

531
00:20:50.508 --> 00:20:52.038
How dare you do that to your older brother?

532
00:20:54.008 --> 00:20:55.048
Kyung Hoon.

533
00:20:55.048 --> 00:20:56.109
Sit down.

534
00:20:56.879 --> 00:20:58.349
Don't hit Kyung Hoon.

535
00:20:59.018 --> 00:21:01.919
(He successfully executes an emotional facial expression.)

536
00:21:02.389 --> 00:21:04.359
(I'm sorry, Kyung Hoon.)

537
00:21:04.518 --> 00:21:06.459
- Cut. Okay. - Great.

538
00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.258
Okay.

539
00:21:08.258 --> 00:21:10.058
(He's getting better at acting.)

540
00:21:10.058 --> 00:21:11.828
His acting is improving.

541
00:21:12.728 --> 00:21:14.969
- It's over. - They complimented each other...

542
00:21:14.969 --> 00:21:16.129
for a warm ending.

543
00:21:17.268 --> 00:21:19.238
This is where it gets interesting. Watch closely.

544
00:21:19.798 --> 00:21:21.538
This is Kyung Hoon's action scene.

545
00:21:21.538 --> 00:21:23.068
(This is where Kyung Hoon's action scene will take place.)

546
00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:24.738
Action.

547
00:21:24.738 --> 00:21:27.578
(After winning the fight, Kyung Hoon warns Sang Min.)

548
00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:28.578
(Kicking)

549
00:21:28.808 --> 00:21:30.679
- What was that? - That's good acting.

550
00:21:30.679 --> 00:21:32.318
Don't ever come find me again.

551
00:21:33.278 --> 00:21:34.788
- The shin. - He kicked in the shin.

552
00:21:34.788 --> 00:21:37.758
(He leaves after a warning.)

553
00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:40.258
(Something looks awkward.)

554
00:21:40.728 --> 00:21:43.728
Cut. Kyung Hoon, your walking is like this.

555
00:21:44.399 --> 00:21:46.828
(Wiggling)

556
00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:48.528
I'm excited because I won.

557
00:21:50.068 --> 00:21:51.169
(He is logical!)

558
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:52.768
Did you analyze the story?

559
00:21:53.199 --> 00:21:54.508
He's excited after winning the fight.

560
00:21:54.508 --> 00:21:56.068
He analyzed the script.

561
00:21:57.139 --> 00:21:59.909
We'll take it from the front. Just go like this.

562
00:22:00.508 --> 00:22:01.508
Rolling.

563
00:22:02.849 --> 00:22:04.449
(Sang Min is back to see Kyung Hoon with his men.)

564
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:06.818
The action scene is pretty good.

565

(Actual footage from the shoot)

566
00:22:09.988 --> 00:22:11.419
Go, go, go!

567
00:22:11.689 --> 00:22:15.088
Take him down.

568
00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:17.699
Go get him! Go!

569
00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:18.699
(They're all working together for the shoot.)

570
00:22:20.528 --> 00:22:22.369
(The fight choreography looked awkward at first,)

571
00:22:23.798 --> 00:22:26.298
(but Kyung Hoon is almost flying now.)

572
00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:28.909
- That's good. - He's Donnie Yen.

573
00:22:29.768 --> 00:22:30.778
Action.

574
00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:32.078
He's good.

575
00:22:32.078 --> 00:22:33.879
(He is able to perform difficult action scenes.)

576
00:22:34.048 --> 00:22:36.109
All Kyung Hoon did was run. The other guy did it by himself.

577
00:22:36.109 --> 00:22:37.179
No, no.

578
00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:39.649
Take two.

579
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:41.318

of the two men suffering from the aftereffects of love.

602

- Wheesung is in the music video. - That's unfair.

657
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:57.659
This is like hitting us in the back of our heads.

658
00:28:58.058 --> 00:28:59.199
We hit you in the back of your heads.

659
00:29:01.728 --> 00:29:02.728
Okay.

660
00:29:02.728 --> 00:29:03.738
(He finished it in one cut.)

661
00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:06.068
(Eun I is genuinely amused by him.)

662
00:29:06.068 --> 00:29:08.209
You should've been the male lead character.

663
00:29:10.238 --> 00:29:11.439
You look too handsome.

664
00:29:11.879 --> 00:29:13.008
- When I... - This is cheating.

665
00:29:13.008 --> 00:29:14.048
looked at him in the monitor,

666
00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:15.909
I wanted to just keep shooting him.

667
00:29:16.349 --> 00:29:18.119
- This is Wheesung's music video. - That's how I felt.

668
00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:22.449
- Yeong Cheol. - Isn't he too impactful?

669
00:29:22.449 --> 00:29:24.619
He should've been the lead actor.

670
00:29:25.088 --> 00:29:27.988
- Doesn't he look like a lead actor? - He's amazing, isn't he?

671
00:29:29.088 --> 00:29:30.088
- He's amazing. - He's great, isn't he?

672
00:29:30.088 --> 00:29:31.099
(His jawline is amazing.)

673
00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:32.728
- All right. - Look at the charisma.

674
00:29:32.728 --> 00:29:34.429
(Everyone is amazed by his sharp jawline.)

675
00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:36.298
- My goodness. - He could cut us with that.

676
00:29:36.298 --> 00:29:38.369
I know. He's amazing.

677
00:29:38.369 --> 00:29:39.399
(When the music plays,)

678
00:29:39.538 --> 00:29:40.538
(he gathers his energy...)

679
00:29:40.538 --> 00:29:42.939
(and shouts.)

680
00:29:43.169 --> 00:29:44.879
(He's good!)

681
00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:48.508
(Go, Wheesung!)

682
00:29:50.008 --> 00:29:52.649
(He perfectly hits each note.)

683
00:29:52.978 --> 00:29:54.449
(Because of love)

684
00:29:54.449 --> 00:29:55.518
That sounded so annoying.

685
00:29:57.058 --> 00:29:58.058
Okay. Cut.

686
00:29:58.058 --> 00:29:59.058
(Yeong Cheol's soul is so different from Wheesung's soul.)

687
00:29:59.058 --> 00:30:01.629
That was good. Wheesung's part is done.

688
00:30:02.129 --> 00:30:03.959
- Thank you. - Thank you.

689
00:30:04.028 --> 00:30:06.099
- That's such a big favor. - Thank you.

690
00:30:07.169 --> 00:30:08.429
He saved it.

691
00:30:08.998 --> 00:30:10.869
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

692
00:30:10.869 --> 00:30:12.399
Before we change the angle,

693
00:30:12.568 --> 00:30:14.369
Yeong Cheol will sit there.

694
00:30:14.369 --> 00:30:15.469
Okay.

695
00:30:16.939 --> 00:30:18.109
What do we do?

696
00:30:19.738 --> 00:30:20.748
Will he suddenly change to Yeong Cheol?

697
00:30:20.808 --> 00:30:21.849
Yes.

698
00:30:22.949 --> 00:30:25.379
I love the idea. Love the idea.

699
00:30:25.379 --> 00:30:26.849
You are the extreme ends.

700
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:30.219
(They're in the same space, but they look very different.)

701
00:30:30.459 --> 00:30:31.659
Is it too frustrating?

702
00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:34.359
- Two. - Show me the angle.

703
00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:35.359
(Eun I is planning the camera angle to make him look less bad.)

704
00:30:35.359 --> 00:30:37.498
We should get it in one go.

705
00:30:37.498 --> 00:30:38.828
- Yes. - There should be no delay.

706
00:30:38.828 --> 00:30:42.068
(The lead actor is distracted.)

707
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:44.838
Yeong Cheol. Yeong Cheol. Yeong Cheol!

708
00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:45.838
Okay.

709
00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:47.639
Can I put the coffee here?

710
00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:49.338
- Don't move. - Okay.

711
00:30:49.568 --> 00:30:51.538
Yeong Cheol, why are you drinking coffee?

712
00:30:51.538 --> 00:30:52.538
(He sips the coffee.)

713
00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:53.538
This coffee is really good.

714
00:30:53.538 --> 00:30:54.909
Please take the coffee away from him.

715
00:30:55.879 --> 00:30:57.449
(She shakes her head.)

716
00:30:57.719 --> 00:30:59.248
This can never happen in Hollywood, can it?

717
00:30:59.318 --> 00:31:01.719
This is the first scene, and I'm already sick of him.

718
00:31:03.859 --> 00:31:05.219
(She's sick of his face.)

719
00:31:05.219 --> 00:31:06.219
Let's do this.

720
00:31:06.219 --> 00:31:07.758
This is only the first scene. Why is it so funny?

721
00:31:08.528 --> 00:31:11.058
(It's a music video about the clumsy hero Yeong Cheol...)

722
00:31:11.058 --> 00:31:13.568
(who can't do anything well.)

723
00:31:13.998 --> 00:31:15.969
It's not too bad when he's slightly covered by the curtain.

724
00:31:15.969 --> 00:31:16.969
Yes.

725
00:31:16.969 --> 00:31:19.768
Yeong Cheol will change into different characters.

726
00:31:20.238 --> 00:31:21.238
Yeong Cheol.

727
00:31:21.238 --> 00:31:24.679
(The first clumsy hero he will be...)

728
00:31:26.709 --> 00:31:29.449
(is a member of Kimsman, not Kingsman.)

729
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:31.478
Manner maketh man.

730
00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:33.889
Manner maketh man.

731
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:35.649
Sit here, Yeong Cheol.

732
00:31:35.649 --> 00:31:36.649
Manner maketh man.

733
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:37.758
All right.

734
00:31:38.518 --> 00:31:40.159
- Here. - Here?

735
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:41.629
- Please. - Okay. Thank you very much.

736
00:31:41.659 --> 00:31:43.659
And...

737
00:31:44.228 --> 00:31:45.258
Shut your mouth, please.

738
00:31:45.258 --> 00:31:47.099
No. Nice to meet you. I am Colin Firth.

739
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:48.669
No?

740
00:31:49.068 --> 00:31:50.298
(Today's scene-stealer is here.)

741
00:31:50.298 --> 00:31:51.439
He's here.

742
00:31:51.439 --> 00:31:52.538
Jang Hoon is here.

743
00:31:52.699 --> 00:31:53.738
Hello.

744
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:54.909
Hello, Jang Hoon.

745
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:56.038
(The director greets him.)

746
00:31:56.038 --> 00:31:57.209
You don't have to be so formal to me.

747
00:31:57.709 --> 00:32:00.008
- We have a cameo. - He's our great actor.

748
00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:01.409
Mr. Seo.

749
00:32:01.409 --> 00:32:02.778
(He's Leonardo SeoCaprio.)

750
00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:04.379
Action. Look back.

751
00:32:04.379 --> 00:32:05.449
(The shoot resumes.)

752
00:32:05.449 --> 00:32:06.679
That's it.

753
00:32:06.679 --> 00:32:07.818
Manner maketh man.

754
00:32:10.719 --> 00:32:11.988
Is this a punishment?

755
00:32:13.258 --> 00:32:15.328
Do I have to hear that all day long?

756
00:32:16.058 --> 00:32:17.058
Is the angle okay?

757
00:32:17.058 --> 00:32:19.399
(Director Song is worried about the angle again.)

758
00:32:19.798 --> 00:32:21.998
- Eun I looks different. - I know.

759
00:32:21.998 --> 00:32:23.129
- She looks amazing. - She's doing that there too.

760
00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:24.238
I know.

761
00:32:24.538 --> 00:32:26.939
I wanted to make him look as great as possible.

762
00:32:27.038 --> 00:32:28.939
But I ended up cursing a few times at the shoot.

763
00:32:29.008 --> 00:32:30.278
- Really? - I couldn't stop myself.

764
00:32:31.179 --> 00:32:33.238
(Every crew member including the director is busy.)

765
00:32:33.609 --> 00:32:34.808
This is real whisky.

766
00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:36.679
Just kidding.

767
00:32:37.548 --> 00:32:38.949
That idiot.

768
00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:45.919
It's better to dress up as a girl and walk around the street.

769
00:32:46.219 --> 00:32:47.389
(Staying with Yeong Cheol all day is harder than being punished.)

770
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:48.959
This is so tough.

771
00:32:49.258 --> 00:32:50.929
He won't stop talking.

772
00:32:51.258 --> 00:32:52.498
(He's satisfied.)

773
00:32:52.498 --> 00:32:53.669
He likes it.

774
00:32:54.998 --> 00:32:57.639
(Shut your mouth.)

775
00:32:57.639 --> 00:32:58.669
I will hit you.

776
00:32:58.998 --> 00:33:00.308
Look as if you want to...

777
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:02.969
hit Yeong Cheol.

778
00:33:03.109 --> 00:33:04.308
- You can handle it, right? - I can.

779
00:33:04.308 --> 00:33:07.449
Okay. Good. Very good. Excellent. One more time.

780
00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:10.179
He's Samuel L. Jackson.

781
00:33:10.209 --> 00:33:13.278
Is he Samuel L. Jackson's character from "Kingsman"?

782
00:33:13.719 --> 00:33:15.349
Ready. Cue.

783
00:33:15.419 --> 00:33:16.818
Can you grind your teeth?

784
00:33:16.818 --> 00:33:19.058
(Grinding his teeth)

785
00:33:19.058 --> 00:33:20.959
(They are impressed.)

786
00:33:21.028 --> 00:33:22.389
Kim Yeong Cheol.

787
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:24.199
(His rage towards Yeong Cheol is actually real.)

788
00:33:24.199 --> 00:33:25.659
- Min So Hee. - Cut.

789
00:33:26.328 --> 00:33:27.369
Action.

790
00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:28.728
(Seomuel L. Jackson is a genius actor.)

791
00:33:30.498 --> 00:33:32.498
(He improvises it.)

792
00:33:32.498 --> 00:33:34.038
(She's satisfied.)

793
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:35.808
Cheers.

794
00:33:35.808 --> 00:33:37.038
(He finishes every scene in one go.)

795
00:33:37.038 --> 00:33:38.278
That's good.

796
00:33:38.778 --> 00:33:40.278
Next is the action scene.

797
00:33:41.248 --> 00:33:43.109
It's your first ever action scene.

798
00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:45.518
It's Yeong Cheol's first action scene.

799
00:33:45.518 --> 00:33:48.288
(He practiced hard with K-Tigers.)

800
00:33:49.088 --> 00:33:52.459
(I've been waiting for this day.)

801
00:33:53.318 --> 00:33:55.429
Director Song...

802
00:33:55.929 --> 00:33:56.929
Wait.

803
00:33:56.929 --> 00:33:59.828
(To replicate the action scene of "Kingsman",)

804
00:34:00.268 --> 00:34:02.399
(Yeong Cheol practiced hard,)

805
00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:06.399
(and they got an action camera.)

806
00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:09.869
Director Song really cherishes Yeong Cheol.

807
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:13.108
She tried so hard to make it look amazing.

808
00:34:13.309 --> 00:34:15.048
She put a lot of effort into it.

809
00:34:15.809 --> 00:34:17.019
(She checks the angle.)

810
00:34:17.249 --> 00:34:18.579
(He pretends to throw something at Yeong Cheol.)

811
00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.048
(He falls backwards.)

812
00:34:22.048 --> 00:34:24.059
You are really terrible at acting.

813
00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:26.188
How will we do this?

814
00:34:26.188 --> 00:34:27.929
Don't move your whole torso.

815
00:34:28.289 --> 00:34:29.429
Just move your head.

816
00:34:29.588 --> 00:34:31.258
- It's very important. - Seomuel L. Jackson.

817
00:34:31.329 --> 00:34:32.999
- Who is she? - Is she Wonder Woman?

818
00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:34.269
- Is she Wonder Woman? - Is it a man or a woman?

819
00:34:34.269 --> 00:34:35.769
- Is it a woman? - Is it a lady?

820
00:34:35.798 --> 00:34:38.969
(She will make this fight scene serious.)

821
00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:42.469
It's Taemi.

822
00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:44.738
It's Taemi.

823
00:34:44.809 --> 00:34:46.278
She cast a lot of people.

824
00:34:46.278 --> 00:34:48.749
(She's an action film actress from K-Tigers...)

825
00:34:48.749 --> 00:34:50.679
(who was a national Taekwondo athlete in 2007.)

826
00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.988
It's the scene where Yeong Cheol gets beaten up.

827
00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.258
She really asked us to beat him well. Let's do that.

828
00:34:57.258 --> 00:34:58.488
Don't beat me up.

829
00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:02.128
Think about why you are here today.

830
00:35:02.128 --> 00:35:03.188
(She reminds them what they are here for.)

831
00:35:03.528 --> 00:35:04.559
Action.

832
00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:05.929
(Beat him up!)

833
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:08.528
(They kick him ruthlessly.)

834
00:35:08.528 --> 00:35:11.668
(Worried about his friend, he can't control his facial expression.)

835
00:35:11.738 --> 00:35:12.869
They are really hitting me.

836
00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:13.938
(He screams.)

837
00:35:13.938 --> 00:35:14.969
Cut.

838
00:35:15.838 --> 00:35:18.438
They are really hitting me.

839
00:35:18.608 --> 00:35:21.179
(He deserves the Oscars.)

840
00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:23.548
Why don't we do it one more time?

841
00:35:23.548 --> 00:35:24.979
(He suggests that they do one more take.)

842
00:35:24.979 --> 00:35:26.148
Everyone agreed.

843
00:35:26.449 --> 00:35:30.188
(The second clumsy hero he will be...)

844
00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:32.719
(is Thar, not Thor.)

845
00:35:32.858 --> 00:35:34.858
- Is he Thor? - They prepared a lot of things.

846
00:35:35.128 --> 00:35:36.258
- What's that? - He's doing everything alone.

847
00:35:36.258 --> 00:35:37.798
It's like a parody.

848
00:35:37.798 --> 00:35:40.429
You look like Thor, Yeong Cheol.

849
00:35:41.769 --> 00:35:42.969
What have you done to me?

850
00:35:43.298 --> 00:35:44.398
You look like Chris Hemsworth.

851
00:35:44.568 --> 00:35:45.568
I'm Thor.

852
00:35:45.838 --> 00:35:47.008
(He's filled with confidence.)

853
00:35:47.008 --> 00:35:48.338
- I will... - Let's do that later.

854
00:35:48.338 --> 00:35:50.139
He looks like Ae Sook dressed up as a man.

855
00:35:52.378 --> 00:35:54.309
(He actually does.)

856
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:55.309
Who is that?

857
00:35:55.778 --> 00:35:57.648
- He's my older sister. - His sister.

858
00:35:57.648 --> 00:35:59.148
My sister has been on TV.

859
00:36:00.619 --> 00:36:04.389
(The day of the shoot, it was still very cold.)

860
00:36:05.358 --> 00:36:06.358
It's so cold.

861
00:36:07.088 --> 00:36:08.088
It's so cold.

862
00:36:08.588 --> 00:36:10.458
Stretch your arm like this.

863
00:36:10.898 --> 00:36:13.159
That's it. You have to stretch your body completely.

864
00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:15.528
The crew should stand here.

865
00:36:15.729 --> 00:36:16.938
Why are you wearing mine?

866
00:36:17.168 --> 00:36:19.199
- The making film will be funny. - That's mine.

867
00:36:19.338 --> 00:36:21.168
I planned the storyboard exclusively for the making film.

868
00:36:21.168 --> 00:36:22.668
(The making film was more important for her.)

869
00:36:22.668 --> 00:36:23.778
It's going to be fun.

870
00:36:23.909 --> 00:36:27.909
When we start shooting, you have to move.

871
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:29.409
We're all set.

872
00:36:29.608 --> 00:36:30.648
The camera is rolling.

873
00:36:31.148 --> 00:36:32.148
Action.

874
00:36:37.258 --> 00:36:39.559
- Please leave the frame. - Come on.

875
00:36:39.559 --> 00:36:42.088
- This way. – This way.

876
00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:43.699
- Hurry. - Hurry up.

877
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:45.898
Just keep rolling the camera.

878
00:36:46.028 --> 00:36:47.028
All right.

879
00:36:48.469 --> 00:36:50.338
You can't come out yet!

880
00:36:51.798 --> 00:36:53.199
Come on!

881
00:36:53.838 --> 00:36:55.539
It was so cold.

882
00:36:55.838 --> 00:36:57.039
Let's do it again.

883
00:36:57.039 --> 00:36:58.878
- My gosh. - Let's do it again.

884
00:36:58.878 --> 00:37:00.778
Come on.

885
00:37:01.108 --> 00:37:03.008
Why would you come out?

886
00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:05.918
(Why would you come out?)

887
00:37:05.918 --> 00:37:08.488
My gosh! Is this your first-time shooting?

888
00:37:08.488 --> 00:37:09.849
Shouldn't he take off his glasses?

889
00:37:09.849 --> 00:37:11.358
Take off your glasses.

890
00:37:11.719 --> 00:37:12.719
Why am I wearing the glasses?

891
00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:14.429
We have to do it again because of the glasses.

892
00:37:14.758 --> 00:37:17.159
- It's so cold. - It wasn't my fault.

893
00:37:17.628 --> 00:37:18.729
Let's do it again.

894
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:20.528
- We didn't go outside at all. - Is Thor wearing glasses...

895
00:37:20.528 --> 00:37:22.068
because he can't see?

896
00:37:22.068 --> 00:37:23.429
- Yes. - The green screen.

897
00:37:24.269 --> 00:37:25.269
Be careful.

898
00:37:25.269 --> 00:37:26.269
(They bring out a huge green screen.)

899
00:37:26.269 --> 00:37:29.008
Where will we install the wind machine?

900
00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:30.579
Are they using a wind machine in that weather?

901
00:37:30.579 --> 00:37:31.738
Yes. He had to fly.

902
00:37:31.738 --> 00:37:33.778
It must've been so cold.

903
00:37:34.148 --> 00:37:36.749
Eun I, it better be good.

904
00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:38.349
Look at his face.

905
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:39.449
Turn on the wind machine.

906
00:37:39.519 --> 00:37:40.548
The wind machine.

907
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:43.418
- His hair. - Your hair.

908
00:37:43.418 --> 00:37:44.659
Make sure you get the hair.

909
00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:47.188
- You can shoot that indoors. - Right.

910
00:37:47.188 --> 00:37:48.329
- Why would you... - I know.

911
00:37:48.389 --> 00:37:50.028
- Look at his face. - Shush. Be quiet.

912
00:37:50.028 --> 00:37:51.199
(She hushes him.)

913
00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:53.729
Why didn't we shoot it indoors?

914
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:55.329
- You could shoot it indoors. - Couldn't we do it indoors?

915
00:37:55.469 --> 00:37:58.269
It takes time to move.

916
00:37:58.338 --> 00:37:59.369
Do it.

917
00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:02.238
- That's it. - That's it.

918
00:38:02.869 --> 00:38:05.608
(They shoot the flying scene from the back.)

919
00:38:05.608 --> 00:38:07.878
Why did you get his face when you're showing his back?

920
00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:11.778
I'm coming to find justice!

921
00:38:12.479 --> 00:38:14.219
You will avenge Eun I!

922
00:38:14.519 --> 00:38:16.249
You will kill her when you catch her!

923
00:38:16.249 --> 00:38:17.659
(Yeong Cheol continued to move without arriving anywhere.)

924
00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:18.659
(He got his makeup fixed.)

925
00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:19.758
You should grow your beard.

926
00:38:19.758 --> 00:38:21.229
(Jang Hoon suggests that he grows his beard.)

927
00:38:21.358 --> 00:38:23.128
With a beard,

928
00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:25.929
your mouth doesn't stand out.

929
00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:28.269
When I say action, gather your energy...

930
00:38:28.568 --> 00:38:30.599
and raise your arm. The light.

931
00:38:30.838 --> 00:38:32.969
What is Thor doing? Is he hammering meat?

932
00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:35.168
He's destroying Kang's Kitchen, isn't he?

933
00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:36.539
- He is. - He is.

934
00:38:36.539 --> 00:38:38.409
- Action. - He's destroying Kang's Kitchen.

935
00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:40.648
Gather your energy.

936
00:38:40.648 --> 00:38:42.008
(He growls.)

937
00:38:42.648 --> 00:38:44.918
Raise your arm and hit it.

938
00:38:45.418 --> 00:38:46.449
The light.

939
00:38:46.878 --> 00:38:47.918
Strike it.

940
00:38:52.358 --> 00:38:55.329
(Their chemistry shines anywhere.)

941
00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:56.929
- Let's get Jang Hoon's cut first. - Okay.

942
00:38:56.929 --> 00:38:58.599
- Please come. - All right.

943
00:38:58.599 --> 00:39:01.168
(Is it finally my turn?)

944
00:39:01.168 --> 00:39:03.099
Here's what we will do. When he lifts the meat up...

945
00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:04.869
and looks at it, hit the back of his head.

946
00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:06.738
Then Yeong Cheol can say "Can I?"

947
00:39:06.738 --> 00:39:08.469
- Do I say it after I get hit? - Yes.

948
00:39:10.409 --> 00:39:13.139
He looks like he's been waiting for this moment.

949
00:39:13.909 --> 00:39:16.079
Please look at him as if he's pathetic.

950
00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:17.479
- Okay. - Chef Seo.

951
00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:18.719
Action.

952
00:39:18.719 --> 00:39:20.719
(He's doing a method acting with his eyebrows.)

953
00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:24.088
Can I?

954
00:39:24.258 --> 00:39:26.418
- Cut. - Chef Seo is done.

955
00:39:27.088 --> 00:39:28.289
- Am I finished? - Yes.

956
00:39:28.289 --> 00:39:30.088
- Am I done with this outfit? - Yes.

957
00:39:30.088 --> 00:39:32.229
- Was it only for this one cut? - Yes.

958
00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:33.829
(By method-acting, he finished it in no time.)

959
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:35.329
You seem so happy.

960
00:39:35.929 --> 00:39:38.738
I am happy and also...

961
00:39:38.798 --> 00:39:39.798
Are you sad?

962
00:39:39.798 --> 00:39:41.409
- Are you sad? - I am all right.

963
00:39:41.409 --> 00:39:45.108
(The third clumsy hero he will be is...)

964
00:39:45.338 --> 00:39:47.349
(Tambourine, not Wolverine.)

965
00:39:48.648 --> 00:39:51.519
Hello. I am Wolverine's little brother, Tambourine.

966
00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:53.179
(He's Tambourine.)

967
00:39:53.318 --> 00:39:55.088
- I'm surprised. - They did a lot of things.

968
00:39:55.148 --> 00:39:56.548
They worked really hard.

969
00:39:56.548 --> 00:39:58.119
The scale of this project is big.

970
00:39:58.188 --> 00:39:59.389
Where did Jang Hoon go? Where's Jang Hoon?

971
00:39:59.918 --> 00:40:00.929
(Tambourine looks for Jang Hoon.)

972
00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:02.559
- Let's start. - He finished it in one second.

973
00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:05.099
Hello. I am Wolverine's little brother, Tambourine.

974
00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:06.929
This is such a funny two shot.

975
00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:08.999
(They make a visually stunning two shot.)

976
00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:11.568
Jang Hoon even dressed up as a woman.

977
00:40:11.639 --> 00:40:13.369
- They did so much. - He even dressed up as a woman.

978
00:40:13.909 --> 00:40:15.769
(He tries to stay calm.)

979
00:40:17.878 --> 00:40:18.979
He's pretty.

980
00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:22.579
- He's pretty. - He does everything in the end.

981
00:40:22.579 --> 00:40:23.719
I wanted to go home fast.

982
00:40:24.619 --> 00:40:26.349
Now your roles have changed.

983
00:40:26.418 --> 00:40:28.088
He's come to help you.

984
00:40:28.088 --> 00:40:29.918
But he types with those claws.

985
00:40:29.918 --> 00:40:31.059
(He will type with his Wolverine claws.)

986
00:40:31.789 --> 00:40:33.019
- That's a fun idea. - It's unique.

987
00:40:33.088 --> 00:40:34.229
What's that?

988
00:40:35.358 --> 00:40:36.358
That's it.

989
00:40:36.429 --> 00:40:38.028
Move your hands more.

990
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:41.929
You have to move your hands more.

991
00:40:41.929 --> 00:40:43.128
(He's spaced out.)

992
00:40:43.128 --> 00:40:44.599
It suits him, doesn't it?

993
00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:49.539
He's good. He's a good actor.

994
00:40:49.738 --> 00:40:52.079
Can you scratch your head with your claws?

995
00:40:52.338 --> 00:40:53.749
(He scratches his head.)

996
00:40:53.749 --> 00:40:54.909
Look embarrassed.

997
00:40:54.909 --> 00:40:56.208
(He's self-conscious.)

998
00:40:56.648 --> 00:40:58.318
- I am good at this. - That's it.

999
00:40:58.979 --> 00:41:00.179
That's perfectly it.

1000
00:41:00.318 --> 00:41:01.318
Action.

1001
00:41:01.488 --> 00:41:04.019
Type slowly. Look at the paper from time to time.

1002
00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:07.229
Type and then look at the paper again.

1003
00:41:09.389 --> 00:41:10.628
Type again.

1004
00:41:11.298 --> 00:41:13.628
Jang Hoon gets frustrated and tell him to move.

1005
00:41:14.229 --> 00:41:15.729
(He's frustrated.)

1006
00:41:15.729 --> 00:41:16.969
Get out!

1007
00:41:17.699 --> 00:41:19.568
(He's surprised.)

1008
00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:20.769
You're embarrassed.

1009
00:41:21.708 --> 00:41:24.278
(He scratches his head.)

1010
00:41:24.378 --> 00:41:25.738
He's the best when he acts self-conscious.

1011
00:41:25.738 --> 00:41:27.979
He's really good. It looks real.

1012
00:41:27.979 --> 00:41:28.979
It really looks real.

1013
00:41:29.648 --> 00:41:31.918
- It looks real. - That's his best acting.

1014
00:41:31.918 --> 00:41:33.079
(Gosh!)

1015
00:41:33.548 --> 00:41:35.048
(He flips his hair.)

1016
00:41:35.988 --> 00:41:37.219
Jang Hoon is best at acting angry.

1017
00:41:37.219 --> 00:41:38.458
Yeong Cheol is the best at acting self-conscious.

1018
00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:40.019
(They are perfect partners.)

1019
00:41:40.329 --> 00:41:41.358
Let's shoot a close-up shot.

1020
00:41:41.528 --> 00:41:42.758
We should shoot a drama.

1021
00:41:42.758 --> 00:41:44.659
It's a shame it's only going to be a music video. It's too short.

1022
00:41:47.028 --> 00:41:48.898
Wolverine's body is so filthy.

1023
00:41:48.898 --> 00:41:51.438
(He realizes it only now.)

1024
00:41:51.438 --> 00:41:53.168
Wolverine's body is so filthy.

1025
00:41:53.298 --> 00:41:55.208
(Laughing)

1026
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:57.139
He's not Wolverine. He's someone who's given up on his body.

1027
00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:58.278
- I've given up. - You've given up on your body.

1028
00:41:58.278 --> 00:42:00.349
Hugh Jackman is going to curse at me when he sees it.

1029
00:42:00.409 --> 00:42:03.979
(The fourth clumsy hero character he's playing is...)

1030
00:42:04.249 --> 00:42:05.949
(Doctor Stress.)

1031
00:42:06.219 --> 00:42:08.889
I get that we are close, but...

1032
00:42:08.889 --> 00:42:09.988
(Jang Hoon appears again.)

1033
00:42:09.988 --> 00:42:11.858
- Look at that costume. - The two of us were there.

1034
00:42:11.858 --> 00:42:14.088
I think they spent more money than we did.

1035
00:42:14.188 --> 00:42:17.628
We imported secondhand costumes.

1036
00:42:18.398 --> 00:42:20.199
Our crew found them online.

1037
00:42:20.269 --> 00:42:21.298
There it is.

1038
00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:23.528
This is your third single, isn't it?

1039
00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:25.068
It is.

1040
00:42:25.539 --> 00:42:26.969
Why do you keep releasing singles?

1041
00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:30.409
- I am so happy when I am on stage. - I understand that.

1042
00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:33.438
Jong Shin must've done something really wrong to him.

1043
00:42:33.749 --> 00:42:37.048
How could he write a song for him?

1044
00:42:37.048 --> 00:42:38.719
I have Jong Shin's adult video tape.

1045
00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:39.719
(Is that the secret?)

1046
00:42:40.789 --> 00:42:43.719
(Laughing)

1047
00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:45.458
I have Jong Shin's tape.

1048
00:42:46.988 --> 00:42:48.229
What are you talking about?

1049
00:42:48.758 --> 00:42:50.458
(That's really funny.)

1050
00:42:50.458 --> 00:42:53.869
- Are you serious? - Jang Hoon really laughed hard.

1051
00:42:55.068 --> 00:42:56.528
I'm serious.

1052
00:42:57.269 --> 00:42:59.539
Aren't you supposed to have a tape for every celebrity?

1053
00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:01.838
That's the funniest thing you said today.

1054
00:43:01.838 --> 00:43:02.869
(He loves the joke.)

1055
00:43:03.738 --> 00:43:06.708
I can't imagine Jong Shin being on an adult video.

1056
00:43:08.679 --> 00:43:11.278
I know his wife's secret too.

1057
00:43:11.878 --> 00:43:13.219
Let's start right away.

1058
00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:14.418
(When the shoot resumes, he becomes sullen again.)

1059
00:43:14.488 --> 00:43:16.548
It takes less than five seconds for him to get sullen again.

1060
00:43:18.758 --> 00:43:20.019
Where is the genius actor?

1061
00:43:21.159 --> 00:43:23.699
Please tell the acting prodigy to come out.

1062
00:43:24.358 --> 00:43:26.099
Leonardo SeoCaprio.

1063
00:43:26.929 --> 00:43:28.429
(Leonardo SeoCaprio appears.)

1064
00:43:28.599 --> 00:43:30.398
(They bow to him.)

1065
00:43:30.398 --> 00:43:31.738
Why did you dye your hair?

1066
00:43:31.738 --> 00:43:33.338
(Little K-Tigers are Jang Hoon's buddies for the day.)

1067
00:43:33.568 --> 00:43:37.338
(They are given the prop.)

1068
00:43:37.338 --> 00:43:38.979
- You can't eat it. - It's frozen.

1069
00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:40.108
Don't eat it.

1070
00:43:40.749 --> 00:43:42.548
Action. Get ready, Yeong Cheol.

1071
00:43:42.548 --> 00:43:43.949
Here we go.

1072
00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:46.148
- Eat it. - My goodness.

1073
00:43:48.818 --> 00:43:50.719
It's so awkward.

1074
00:43:51.059 --> 00:43:53.019
I shouldn't have criticized Kyung Hoon for his acting.

1075
00:43:53.019 --> 00:43:54.329
(Kyung Hoon is suddenly encouraged.)

1076
00:43:54.588 --> 00:43:56.659
(Jang Hoon is angry to see the dropped hot dog.)

1077
00:43:56.659 --> 00:43:58.528
How could you swear at me?

1078
00:43:59.028 --> 00:44:01.229
- I didn't swear at you. - He's ad-libbing.

1079
00:44:01.398 --> 00:44:02.699
- Cover your ears, kids. - It's a music video.

1080
00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:04.398
- I just said, "You little...". - Gosh.

1081
00:44:04.398 --> 00:44:06.438
- Cover your ears. - Are you sure?

1082
00:44:06.438 --> 00:44:08.969
- I just said, "You little...". - Don't listen to them.

1083
00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:12.139
- Let's eat the hot dog, guys. - Yes.

1084
00:44:12.139 --> 00:44:15.008
- It's fun time. - Why do you toast them with it?

1085
00:44:17.918 --> 00:44:18.949
(He is intimidated by Jang Hoon's great acting.)

1086
00:44:18.949 --> 00:44:20.588
Try to look intimidated and apologize to him.

1087
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:22.719
I'm sorry.

1088
00:44:22.719 --> 00:44:24.258
- He is doing it again. - Did he say he's sorry?

1089
00:44:24.258 --> 00:44:25.318
(Being punished)

1090
00:44:28.059 --> 00:44:29.059
(Thump)

1091
00:44:29.528 --> 00:44:31.298
(The lights are off all of a sudden.)

1092
00:44:31.298 --> 00:44:33.628
- Why did he turn off the light? - Goodness.

1093
00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:37.369
- It's funny. - Gosh.

1094
00:44:37.369 --> 00:44:38.438
Cut.

1095
00:44:39.668 --> 00:44:41.269
- Why did the lights go off? - I don't know.

1096
00:44:41.438 --> 00:44:43.369
What did he do?

1097
00:44:44.579 --> 00:44:45.938
The lights went off.

1098
00:44:46.608 --> 00:44:47.749
My gosh.

1099
00:44:47.749 --> 00:44:49.249
(What a coincidence.)

1100
00:44:49.249 --> 00:44:51.778
- My goodness. - What's going on?

1101
00:44:51.878 --> 00:44:53.688
The power went out at that moment.

1102
00:44:53.688 --> 00:44:54.818
- Really? - Yes.

1103
00:44:54.818 --> 00:44:57.619
The power accidentally went out at the moment he bumped?

1104
00:44:57.619 --> 00:44:59.559
- Yes. Accidentally. - Really?

1105
00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:01.229
- Seriously? - I though Jang Hoon made it happen.

1106
00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:03.929
Please check out what is wrong.

1107
00:45:04.059 --> 00:45:05.699
- The power went out. - I'll go check it out.

1108
00:45:06.128 --> 00:45:07.369
He must be embarrassed.

1109
00:45:07.769 --> 00:45:10.168
It's not because I hit something, is it?

1110
00:45:10.738 --> 00:45:12.999
No, it's not. It's just a funny coincidence.

1111
00:45:12.999 --> 00:45:14.208
(He's confused.)

1112
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:18.608
I used up everything I got here.

1113
00:45:18.838 --> 00:45:21.778
It's fun time. Let's enjoy your hot dog.

1114
00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:24.648
(Seo DiCaprio's great acting continues.)

1115
00:45:24.648 --> 00:45:26.318
- Good. - Gosh.

1116
00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:30.219
Cut. It's done.

1117
00:45:30.219 --> 00:45:33.188
It's done for Seo DiCaprio.

1118
00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:34.688
- Is it? - Yes.

1119
00:45:34.688 --> 00:45:35.829
Finally.

1120
00:45:36.898 --> 00:45:39.099
I didn't know he could smile that broadly.

1121
00:45:41.229 --> 00:45:43.969
- Good job. - Can I?

1122
00:45:43.969 --> 00:45:46.099
- Can I? - Can I?

1123
00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:49.508
- Can I? - Can I?

1124
00:45:49.668 --> 00:45:51.679
It was great acting.

1125
00:45:51.938 --> 00:45:53.749
You did a good job.

1126
00:45:53.749 --> 00:45:56.778
- You were like Leonardo DiCaprio. - He was.

1127
00:45:56.778 --> 00:45:58.849
- Great job. - Thank you.

1128
00:45:58.849 --> 00:46:00.988
- It was so hard. - I know.

1129
00:46:01.318 --> 00:46:03.688
(An exhausting day is over now.)

1130
00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:06.088
- It was fun. Time flew by so fast. - It was a nice music video.

1131
00:46:06.088 --> 00:46:07.789
Now, the highlight is left.

1132
00:46:07.958 --> 00:46:09.258
She is here.

1133
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:14.168
(She is the secrete weapon of Team Yeong Cheol.)

1134
00:46:15.668 --> 00:46:17.269
Did you shoot it here all day?

1135
00:46:18.099 --> 00:46:19.238
Who is it?

1136
00:46:19.238 --> 00:46:20.869
(Who is it?)

1137
00:46:21.508 --> 00:46:22.909
(Even her silhouette is beautiful.)

1138
00:46:22.909 --> 00:46:24.938
I think I came here at 10. Did I?

1139
00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:29.349
- It was beautiful - She bothered to come to help you.

1140
00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:31.318
(Surprised)

1141
00:46:31.818 --> 00:46:33.079
She's a big star.

1142
00:46:33.318 --> 00:46:34.648
Get lost.

1143
00:46:34.648 --> 00:46:35.789
(It's Uhm Jung Hwa.)

1144
00:46:35.789 --> 00:46:38.119
That would be too extravagant.

1145
00:46:38.289 --> 00:46:40.758
- Did it go well? - You received his call half-asleep.

1146
00:46:40.988 --> 00:46:44.298
She got my call in the morning and said, "Hi, Yeong Cheol."

1147
00:46:44.298 --> 00:46:45.858
- So I said, "Jung Hwa." - No, I was not like that.

1148
00:46:45.858 --> 00:46:46.999
(Who on earth is calling early in the morning?)

1149
00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:48.499
- Hi, Yeong Cheol. - Really?

1150
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:50.199
And you said, "Get lost."

1151
00:46:50.438 --> 00:46:53.639
I'm wearing an outfit that suits the ice rink very well.

1152
00:46:53.639 --> 00:46:55.469
I think you'll look great. I'll take it for you.

1153
00:46:57.608 --> 00:46:58.708
I'll take it for you.

1154
00:46:58.708 --> 00:46:59.979
(Her outfit is revealed.)

1155
00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:01.548
This is it.

1156
00:47:01.548 --> 00:47:03.008
- We'll shoot the last scene. - Goodness.

1157
00:47:03.008 --> 00:47:05.418
- You look gorgeous. - We're wearing the same tone.

1158
00:47:05.519 --> 00:47:08.318
I appreciate that she gladly helped us.

1159
00:47:08.619 --> 00:47:10.988
- I really appreciate it. - She looks cool.

1160
00:47:10.988 --> 00:47:12.159
She is beautiful.

1161
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:14.688
She is so beautiful.

1162
00:47:15.188 --> 00:47:16.858
Face each other.

1163
00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:19.258
Hold out your hands first, Jung Hwa.

1164
00:47:19.499 --> 00:47:22.398
Then Yeong Cheol. Look up together.

1165
00:47:23.269 --> 00:47:24.699
Rise.

1166
00:47:26.168 --> 00:47:27.409
(His legs are shaking.)

1167
00:47:27.409 --> 00:47:29.338
Darn it. That jerk.

1168
00:47:29.568 --> 00:47:31.409
- I was swearing in spite of myself. - That jerk.

1169
00:47:33.278 --> 00:47:35.809
- She is really beautiful. - Hold out your hands, Jung Hwa.

1170
00:47:36.208 --> 00:47:37.979
Hold her hands now, Yeong Cheol.

1171
00:47:38.278 --> 00:47:40.548
(Under the lead of the skillful veteran actress...)

1172
00:47:40.548 --> 00:47:41.749
Okay, cut.

1173
00:47:41.849 --> 00:47:44.519
(the shooting gets over without any problem.)

1174
00:47:45.418 --> 00:47:48.659
It goes like this. Why can't I?

1175
00:47:48.858 --> 00:47:50.829
- It's Wheesung at the beginning. - Wheesung sang the part.

1176
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:52.358
No wonder that was so good.

1177
00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:53.999
Put on your clothes back, Jung Hwa. It's cold.

1178
00:47:54.298 --> 00:47:55.898
- I like the song. - Let me see...

1179
00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:57.898
Wheesung made it awesome.

1180
00:47:58.568 --> 00:48:00.168
(After turning around)

1181
00:48:00.269 --> 00:48:03.369
(Love hurts me so much)

1182
00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:05.338
I'll be off. Thank you.

1183
00:48:05.338 --> 00:48:06.949
(I'll take leave. Thank you.)

1184
00:48:07.648 --> 00:48:10.579
(Even after the last scene, the shooting continues.)

1185
00:48:11.048 --> 00:48:13.349
- Gosh. You must be cold. - It's okay.

1186
00:48:14.188 --> 00:48:16.289
- It should be chilly in the winter. - Right.

1187
00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:18.188
- Please continue until this part. - Gosh.

1188
00:48:18.358 --> 00:48:20.729
Too many people are suffering because of Yeong Cheol.

1189
00:48:20.858 --> 00:48:22.729
- Is that Momoland? - Gosh.

1190
00:48:22.729 --> 00:48:25.028
- Did Momoland come too? - My goodness.

1191
00:48:25.028 --> 00:48:27.898
- He tortured too many people. - My goodness.

1192
00:48:28.798 --> 00:48:31.199
- There are too many celebrities. - What's wrong with that?

1193
00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:33.568
I can ask many celebrities to join, can't I?

1194
00:48:34.238 --> 00:48:35.639
I like your funny dance.

1195
00:48:35.639 --> 00:48:36.979
We can use this part.

1196
00:48:36.979 --> 00:48:38.738
- Then can I cut here? - Yes.

1197
00:48:39.238 --> 00:48:40.449
Save this part.

1198
00:48:40.449 --> 00:48:41.449
(Little K-Tigers are waiting too.)

1199
00:48:41.449 --> 00:48:45.249
We can just shoot this part a couple of times.

1200
00:48:45.818 --> 00:48:47.988
- Gosh. - Oh, my goodness.

1201
00:48:48.188 --> 00:48:50.188
- What was that? - It must have cost a lot.

1202
00:48:50.188 --> 00:48:51.488
(Those in the studio are agitated once again.)

1203
00:48:51.688 --> 00:48:53.659
Was it computer graphic or something? Goodness.

1204
00:48:54.028 --> 00:48:57.199
(If the incredible, full-scale performance...)

1205
00:48:57.898 --> 00:49:02.028
(and the numerous cameo performances make you curious,)

1206

(vote for Yeong Cheol by pressing number 2.)

1207
00:49:07.168 --> 00:49:08.639
That's not fair.

1208
00:49:08.969 --> 00:49:11.708
- My goodness. - The scale is huge.

1209
00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:14.679
Isn't the scale too big?

1210

(Brother School Film Contest)

1211
00:49:16.648 --> 00:49:18.778
- Good luck. - Please give him a big hand.

1212
00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:21.889
- Go, Kim Yeong Cheol. - Go, "Can I?"

1213
00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:23.148
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1214
00:49:23.688 --> 00:49:26.519
(His highly anticipated music video...)

1215
00:49:27.389 --> 00:49:31.128
(makes people even more curious about his performance.)

1216
00:49:31.128 --> 00:49:33.128

1217

("Can I?" by Kim Yeong Cheol, featuring Wheesung)

1218
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.699
His music video seems to be incredible.

1219
00:49:39.068 --> 00:49:43.309
(Something appears on the screen at the back of the stage.)

1220
00:49:44.139 --> 00:49:47.679
(And the competitors get nervous.)

1221
00:49:49.679 --> 00:49:50.918
Is that Wheesung?

- What's its theme? - Its theme?

1266
00:53:38.778 --> 00:53:41.949
The lowest budget is the theme.

1267
00:53:41.949 --> 00:53:43.179
- The lowest budget? - Yes.

1268
00:53:43.179 --> 00:53:45.378
I'd rather say it's the extra tight budget.

1269
00:53:45.378 --> 00:53:46.449
(He'll spend extra tight budget.)

1270
00:53:46.449 --> 00:53:47.519
The extra tight budget?

1271
00:53:47.519 --> 00:53:49.148
- So you're here free of charge. - Due to the cost-effectiveness.

1272
00:53:49.148 --> 00:53:50.258
Sure.

1273
00:53:50.619 --> 00:53:52.519
So we'll shoot with cell phones.

1274
00:53:52.818 --> 00:53:54.229
I'll use mine too.

1275
00:53:54.429 --> 00:53:55.659
With cell phones?

1276
00:53:56.229 --> 00:53:57.858
- They shot it with so low budget. - Until that moment...

1277
00:53:58.099 --> 00:54:00.028
no one knew about the theme...

1278

00:54:03.229 --> 00:54:06.139
I think the two keywords are the luck and a foot.

I want to describe the luck with you.

1281

(Jin Young is amazed at the feet dance.)

1290
00:54:28.429 --> 00:54:30.758
I referred to the music video of Madonna's...

1291
00:54:30.758 --> 00:54:32.099
- "Vogue"... - I watched it too.

1292
00:54:32.099 --> 00:54:33.398
for ours.

1293
00:54:33.398 --> 00:54:35.068
- Okay. - So in the video...

1294
00:54:35.068 --> 00:54:36.329
- Is it famous? - Yes.

1295
00:54:36.329 --> 00:54:38.139
there is a dance like this in there.

1296
00:54:38.139 --> 00:54:39.139
- Madonna... - I know that.

1297
00:54:39.139 --> 00:54:40.838
- does something like this. - "Come on".

1298
00:54:40.838 --> 00:54:42.039
- That would be cool. - Jin Young...

1299
00:54:42.039 --> 00:54:43.438
and you will be...

1300
00:54:43.438 --> 00:54:45.539
doing that dance gracefully.

1301
00:54:46.108 --> 00:54:48.548
Cut. Change the light before we start again.

- Okay. - Is the special lighting ready?

1303
00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:51.179
- Yes. - Yes.

1304
00:54:51.418 --> 00:54:52.519
Okay.

1305
00:54:53.048 --> 00:54:54.519
Is that the special lighting?

1306
00:54:55.048 --> 00:54:56.389
- It's just a flashlight. - Shall I use this one too?

1307
00:54:56.389 --> 00:54:57.988
Okay try it. You mean this one?

1308
00:54:58.458 --> 00:55:00.358
- All right. Let's go. - What on earth is that?

1309
00:55:00.358 --> 00:55:01.958
- Hold the reflector. - It's a disposable dish.

1310
00:55:01.958 --> 00:55:03.028
(Using the aluminium foil dish as a reflector.)

1311
00:55:03.028 --> 00:55:04.699
Gosh. We look so poor.

1312
00:55:05.199 --> 00:55:06.999
They spent 1.60 dollars for that music video.

1313
00:55:07.668 --> 00:55:08.699
(It sure is an extra tight budget.)

1314
00:55:08.699 --> 00:55:10.168
- 1 dollars and 60 cents. - For the disposable dish.

1315
00:55:10.499 --> 00:55:11.499
Ready.

1316
00:55:11.938 --> 00:55:12.999
Good.

1317
00:55:13.369 --> 00:55:14.369
Ready, action.

1318
00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:15.369
(Can they do it like "Vogue" with the cheap equipment?)

1319
00:55:16.838 --> 00:55:19.378
(At least her facial expression is that of Madonna.)

1320
00:55:20.479 --> 00:55:21.548
I like the vibes a lot.

1321
00:55:21.548 --> 00:55:22.579
(She is so serious.)

1322
00:55:22.579 --> 00:55:23.818
Gosh. It's scary.

1323
00:55:25.119 --> 00:55:26.988
I was also scared while shooting it.

1324
00:55:26.988 --> 00:55:28.318
- What were you doing? - I don't know.

1325
00:55:28.318 --> 00:55:29.719
It was like I was in a butcher's shop.

1326
00:55:30.588 --> 00:55:31.688
You're moving too fast.

1327
00:55:32.258 --> 00:55:33.929
There you go. Try to feel it.

1328
00:55:33.929 --> 00:55:35.159
(Slow moves of the hands are the key point.)

1329
00:55:35.159 --> 00:55:37.099
Caress your left cheek with your right hand.

1330
00:55:37.099 --> 00:55:39.458
- There you go. That's "Vogue". - Good.

1331
00:55:40.568 --> 00:55:41.568
Good.

1332
00:55:41.568 --> 00:55:43.128
(Her hand moves and the lighting look quite nice.)

1333
00:55:45.398 --> 00:55:46.438
That's it.

1334
00:55:46.539 --> 00:55:47.608
- Am I done? - Yes.

1335
00:55:47.608 --> 00:55:49.539
Ho Dong, Soo Geun. It's your turn.

1336
00:55:49.539 --> 00:55:51.139
(It's Ho Dong and Soo Geun's turn now.)

1337
00:55:51.139 --> 00:55:53.108
- Did you wash your feet? - I washed them thoroughly.

1338
00:55:53.108 --> 00:55:54.108
(Soo Geun appears barefoot.)

1339
00:55:54.108 --> 00:55:55.208
- They are fragrant. - Shall I use this one?

1340
00:55:55.878 --> 00:55:56.949
They are fragrant, aren't they?

1341
00:55:56.949 --> 00:55:57.949
(Sniffing)

1342
00:55:58.219 --> 00:55:59.949
- I think they stink. - They don't.

1343
00:55:59.949 --> 00:56:01.088
(Why does he smell Soo Geun's feet?)

1344
00:56:01.619 --> 00:56:02.789
Will they shoot his feet?

1345
00:56:03.289 --> 00:56:05.219
- It's so creative. - Since it's "Kicked My Luck Away".

1346
00:56:05.818 --> 00:56:08.588
If it had been Jang Hoon, he would have gone home...

1347
00:56:08.729 --> 00:56:09.789
because he didn't like the idea.

1348
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:11.128
(His silence means yes.)

1349
00:56:11.258 --> 00:56:12.929
Gosh. Director Yoo.

1350
00:56:12.929 --> 00:56:14.798
I'm shooting my first scene after waiting for three hours,

1351
00:56:14.798 --> 00:56:15.969
so I feel really good.

1352
00:56:16.999 --> 00:56:18.269
Nice to see you, Soo Geun.

1353
00:56:18.269 --> 00:56:19.568
- Nice to see you too. - Jin Young...

1354
00:56:19.568 --> 00:56:20.708
The music will be played now.

1355
00:56:21.238 --> 00:56:22.969
The pants... Why don't you take off your pants?

1356
00:56:24.378 --> 00:56:26.539
I think it would be better without the pants.

1357
00:56:26.579 --> 00:56:28.778
Bare skin would be better.

1358
00:56:28.949 --> 00:56:31.019
(Taking them off right away)

1359
00:56:34.088 --> 00:56:36.188
Soo Geun takes off clothes so easily.

1360
00:56:36.619 --> 00:56:39.219
(He's not reluctant to reveal his bare skin at all.)

1361
00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:42.389
- He takes them off immediately. - Gosh.

1362
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:44.429
- Do you like it this way? - Are there shorts?

1363
00:56:44.429 --> 00:56:45.798
He's the world champion in taking off pants.

1364
00:56:45.798 --> 00:56:47.429
- Director Yoon. - What is that?

1365
00:56:48.469 --> 00:56:50.398
Why did you tell me to wear a suit?

1366
00:56:51.369 --> 00:56:52.539
- Take it back. - His suit is not showing.

1367
00:56:53.039 --> 00:56:54.909
- Wearing a suit... - It's not showing anyway.

1368
00:56:55.039 --> 00:56:57.778
- I don't understand. - Soo Geun, your feet got dirty.

1369
00:56:59.579 --> 00:57:01.179
What if my face is infected?

1370
00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:02.309
Do you think my feet are poisonous or something?

1371
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:03.309
(Soo Geun didn't know he has such feet.)

1372
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:04.418
Do you?

1373
00:57:04.479 --> 00:57:05.579
Let's start shooting.

1374
00:57:05.918 --> 00:57:07.019
Action.

1375
00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:12.318
The moves of the feet look natural now.

1376
00:57:14.088 --> 00:57:15.128
That's good.

1377
00:57:15.929 --> 00:57:17.699
(Rubbing hard)

1378
00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:21.099
(Now, the chorus will start soon.)

1379
00:57:21.099 --> 00:57:22.298
His feet are acting good like DiCaprio.

1380
00:57:23.298 --> 00:57:25.499
(The feet express the beat of the electronic dance music.)

1381
00:57:25.898 --> 00:57:26.969
- Kick it. - Kicked my luck away.

1382
00:57:26.969 --> 00:57:28.369
(Kicking the face.)

1383
00:57:28.869 --> 00:57:32.179
(He keeps kicking the luck recklessly.)

1384
00:57:32.679 --> 00:57:35.208
(Ho Dong sobs while singing.)

1385
00:57:35.249 --> 00:57:36.809
- He's gladly kicking it. - Well...

1386
00:57:37.249 --> 00:57:38.418
He's fully using that chance.

1387
00:57:38.719 --> 00:57:40.318
- Kick him once more. - Kick his head one more time.

1388
00:57:40.318 --> 00:57:41.519
(I kicked my luck)

1389
00:57:41.519 --> 00:57:42.789
(Away!)

1390
00:57:43.519 --> 00:57:45.059
(Kicking him hard)

1391
00:57:45.559 --> 00:57:46.758
(Feeling sorry)

1392
00:57:47.128 --> 00:57:48.458
(Applauding for their nice acting using their bodies.)

1393
00:57:48.458 --> 00:57:49.528
That's funny.

1394
00:57:51.798 --> 00:57:52.929
Try this pose.

1395
00:57:52.929 --> 00:57:54.329
He is posing to the last moment.

1396
00:57:55.128 --> 00:57:56.699
- It hurt, didn't it? - Wonderful.

1397
00:57:56.699 --> 00:57:57.738
The acting with the feet was great.

1398
00:57:57.738 --> 00:57:59.398
(Succeeding in shooting the first scene)

1399
00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:00.969
That's not a music video.

1400
00:58:00.969 --> 00:58:02.608
It's rather a comedy skit.

1401
00:58:02.769 --> 00:58:04.438
A music video should be fun too.

1402
00:58:04.438 --> 00:58:05.479
(A music video is something fun too.)

1403
00:58:05.838 --> 00:58:09.249
(They're shooting the group dance now.)

1404
00:58:09.648 --> 00:58:11.019
Let's start. We're recording this time.

1405
00:58:11.679 --> 00:58:13.588
Why should we be wearing underpants?

1406
00:58:13.588 --> 00:58:14.988
Because I want to put more emphasis on your feet.

1407
00:58:15.949 --> 00:58:17.119
Then can I hitch them up a little more?

1408
00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:19.559
Are we wearing these outfits to show our feet?

1409
00:58:19.559 --> 00:58:20.729
- Yes. - Gosh.

1410
00:58:20.889 --> 00:58:22.188
Could you pull them down a little bit?

1411
00:58:22.188 --> 00:58:23.188
(Glancing)

1412
00:58:23.188 --> 00:58:24.929
That looks nice, Soo Geun.

1413
00:58:24.929 --> 00:58:26.298
- Just a little bit. - Good. That's okay.

1414
00:58:26.559 --> 00:58:27.769
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1415
00:58:29.269 --> 00:58:31.099
- That looks good. - Do you want me to help you?

1416
00:58:31.099 --> 00:58:32.369
- Tuck it in. - It's so funny.

1417
00:58:33.438 --> 00:58:34.508
(Let me see.)

1418
00:58:34.508 --> 00:58:36.668
- Like this? - I need a string like that.

1419
00:58:37.679 --> 00:58:39.039
- Gosh. You startled me. - What is it?

1420
00:58:39.679 --> 00:58:40.679
(He must have seen something unbelievable.)

1421
00:58:40.679 --> 00:58:42.179
He is suspicious. Goodness.

1422
00:58:43.008 --> 00:58:44.349
It must be a prank cam.

1423
00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:47.849
I'm sure Sae Yoon is doing this for a prank cam.

1424
00:58:47.849 --> 00:58:48.889
(Ho Dong suspect that it's a prank cam.)

1425
00:58:49.519 --> 00:58:50.988
He kept saying that it was a prank cam.

1426
00:58:51.019 --> 00:58:52.889
- I did think it was. - He did.

1427
00:58:53.258 --> 00:58:56.829
If this is a prank cam, you're going to get beat by me.

1428
00:58:56.898 --> 00:58:58.729
(Shaking with terror)

1429
00:58:58.958 --> 00:59:00.829
Those who shoot you with cell phones are not your fans.

1430
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:01.929
Don't stop them from shooting.

1431
00:59:04.438 --> 00:59:05.938
This is my camera crew.

1432
00:59:06.338 --> 00:59:08.769
(The camera crew is holding cell phones.)

1433
00:59:08.769 --> 00:59:10.608
Gosh. I've never seen this kind of shooting.

1434
00:59:11.608 --> 00:59:13.508
- He hates being filmed with phones. - Is this your way of doing it?

1435
00:59:14.409 --> 00:59:16.179
That's what Ho Dong hates the most.

1436
00:59:16.809 --> 00:59:18.079
He really hates it.

1437
00:59:18.449 --> 00:59:19.849
This is not a baseball game.

1438
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:20.889
What's going on?

1439
00:59:20.889 --> 00:59:22.789
- But is it a man-to-man defense? - Is he going to film me?

1440
00:59:23.219 --> 00:59:25.188
Let's begin shooting. Ready, action.

1441
00:59:25.318 --> 00:59:27.229
- They're for one shots. - Well...

1442
00:59:27.229 --> 00:59:28.389
Get ready.

1443
00:59:29.389 --> 00:59:32.458
(Don't be confused. They're not their big fans.)

1444
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:33.499
Hey. Come on.

1445
00:59:34.099 --> 00:59:35.469
They really look like fans.

1446
00:59:36.668 --> 00:59:41.039
(This is what a man-to-man shooting looks like.)

1447
00:59:41.039 --> 00:59:42.068
They're filming their faces.

1448
00:59:42.469 --> 00:59:44.708
(They're hard-working cameramen, not their fans.)

1449
00:59:44.878 --> 00:59:45.938
Swag.

1450
00:59:46.139 --> 00:59:47.778
(Impressed)

1451
00:59:47.878 --> 00:59:50.749
(The scenes from the individual cameras)

1452
00:59:50.749 --> 00:59:53.449
It's time to kick now. Kick.

1453
00:59:53.449 --> 00:59:54.548
Kick him hard.

1454
00:59:54.548 --> 00:59:56.619
(Wrapping up the scene with a kick)

1455
00:59:57.219 --> 00:59:58.219
Cut.

1456
00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:00.659
(The camera crew is receding.)

1457
01:00:01.559 --> 01:00:03.258
Okay. Ho Don, you stay here.

1458
01:00:03.258 --> 01:00:04.758
(Ho Dong keeps feeling weird about this situation.)

1459
01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:06.128
The three of you take some rest.

1460
01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:07.298
I want to change.

1461
01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:08.599
(While they're taking some rest...)

1462
01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:10.099
- The quality is quite high. - You can put on your pants.

1463
01:00:10.168 --> 01:00:12.269
(the staff is installing something on the set.)

1464
01:00:12.269 --> 01:00:14.039
- Do you want me to raise it? - Yes.

1465
01:00:14.568 --> 01:00:16.568
(Is he installing a cell phone there?)

1466
01:00:16.568 --> 01:00:18.108
- It's for drone shots. - Is it a crane shot?

1467
01:00:19.738 --> 01:00:20.749
It's for drone shots.

1468
01:00:20.749 --> 01:00:22.048
(Are you saying that is for drone shots?)

1469
01:00:22.048 --> 01:00:23.849
- It is dull for a prank cam. - Please raise it higher.

1470
01:00:24.148 --> 01:00:26.079
There would be something more bizarre if it were a prank cam.

1471
01:00:28.019 --> 01:00:29.719
- Hey. Isn't this bizarre enough? - Well...

1472
01:00:29.889 --> 01:00:31.159
Something even a little more bizarre.

1473
01:00:32.219 --> 01:00:33.889
Is Yeong Cheol shooting now too?

1474
01:00:34.229 --> 01:00:35.429
They say there are so many people there.

1475
01:00:35.429 --> 01:00:36.898
- What? - So many people are shooting his.

1476
01:00:37.099 --> 01:00:38.159
- Move over there. - Over there.

1477
01:00:38.159 --> 01:00:40.298
(The cell phone is taking off like a drone.)

1478
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:41.869
Look.

1479
01:00:42.398 --> 01:00:43.568
- Is that for crane shots? - Yes.

1480
01:00:43.838 --> 01:00:46.139
Is it going to move like a drone?

1481
01:00:46.139 --> 01:00:48.238
Jang Hoon will film a drone shot later...

1482
01:00:48.238 --> 01:00:50.139
like this.

1483
01:00:52.008 --> 01:00:53.539
(laughing)

1484
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:56.949
(Seo Jang Hoon, a drone that's 207cm tall)

1485
01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:58.479
Jang Hoon is tall enough to shoot that.

1486
01:00:58.479 --> 01:00:59.579
(Mr. Drone who can also act)

1487
01:01:00.119 --> 01:01:01.519
Is he playing a drone?

1488
01:01:01.688 --> 01:01:03.588
If this is a prank cam, I'll beat that guy first.

1489
01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:05.789
- That guy? - I don't know him well, but...

1490
01:01:06.188 --> 01:01:07.789
He is one of the staff.

1491
01:01:08.188 --> 01:01:09.358
He was really nervous.

1492
01:01:09.389 --> 01:01:10.729
You guys are doing a great job so far.

1493
01:01:12.528 --> 01:01:13.969
- What did he say? - We're almost there.

1494
01:01:13.969 --> 01:01:15.398
- "You're doing a good job." - "You're doing well."

1495
01:01:15.398 --> 01:01:16.528
"You're doing a good job"?

1496
01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:17.969
Pleas stay in the center.

1497
01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:19.938
- Do I look up like this at the end? - Yes.

1498
01:01:19.938 --> 01:01:22.568
- Yes. - Five seconds before it ends.

1499
01:01:22.568 --> 01:01:23.639
(The ending scene is a drone shot.)

1500
01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:25.409
The song is too good to be wasted on a prank cam.

1501
01:01:25.409 --> 01:01:27.409
Okay, ready. Action.

1502
01:01:29.679 --> 01:01:30.778
Kick!

1503
01:01:32.249 --> 01:01:34.548
(The drone shot looks quite nice.)

1504
01:01:34.548 --> 01:01:36.488
(Amazed)

1505
01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:37.659
Goodness.

1506
01:01:38.289 --> 01:01:39.918
Let's rather not kick.

1507
01:01:40.458 --> 01:01:41.588
(It might be a prank cam indeed.)

1508
01:01:41.858 --> 01:01:42.929
What did she say?

1509
01:01:43.329 --> 01:01:44.398
You're so suspicious...

1510
01:01:44.929 --> 01:01:47.128
that the dancer here said...

1511
01:01:47.128 --> 01:01:49.199
that it might be a prank cam lying on the floor.

1512
01:01:49.929 --> 01:01:52.568
She may have said that because you were so suspicious.

1513
01:01:52.769 --> 01:01:53.838
It's because he was kicking like a girl.

1514
01:01:53.838 --> 01:01:55.208
All she did for her life was dance.

1515
01:01:55.909 --> 01:01:58.738
She didn't know anything about a prank cam at all.

1516
01:01:59.309 --> 01:02:00.708
Please wave the the curtain over there.

1517
01:02:00.909 --> 01:02:03.479
(Is a camera hidden here?)

1518
01:02:03.648 --> 01:02:05.019
You stay after the shooting too.

1519
01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:07.249
(He wants to scold them if it really is a prank cam.)

1520
01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:10.458
(Slowly approaching)

1521
01:02:11.188 --> 01:02:13.988
(He goes to check just in case.)

1522
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:15.458
This is hilarious.

1523
01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:16.729
(Is it hidden here?)

1524
01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:19.528
(Embarrassed)

1525
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:21.469
He is continuously suspicious.

1526
01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:22.869
- He really suspected. - I didn't know that.

1527
01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:23.938
Did he really go check it out?

1528
01:02:23.938 --> 01:02:25.139
Because there was no camera at all.

1529
01:02:25.139 --> 01:02:26.298
- He did suspect it. - Right.

1530
01:02:26.338 --> 01:02:28.608
As he had to do weird things.

1531
01:02:28.938 --> 01:02:30.238
They're too tight.

1532
01:02:30.679 --> 01:02:32.409
- Let's use a train. - Okay.

1533
01:02:32.409 --> 01:02:34.409
- A train? - Yes. Take some rest for a moment.

1534
01:02:34.749 --> 01:02:36.849
- They're using a train? - Get ready for a train shot.

1535
01:02:36.849 --> 01:02:37.918
- A train shot? - Gosh.

1536
01:02:38.519 --> 01:02:40.318
(They bring railways for a toy train.)

1537
01:02:40.318 --> 01:02:41.949
- I don't understand. - How does it work?

1538
01:02:42.019 --> 01:02:43.349
- Is that a train shot? - Unbelievable.

1539
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:44.389
(Confused)

1540
01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:46.789
- Jae Won. - A cell phone is on the train.

1541
01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:48.729
(How will the train shot turn out?)

1542
01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:49.988
- It's too slow. - For goodness' sake.

1543
01:02:49.988 --> 01:02:51.999
I was sure that it was a prank cam when I saw that train.

1544
01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:53.628
(Ho Dong was sure of it when he saw the train.)

1545
01:02:54.028 --> 01:02:55.469
I don't understand what kind of shot it is.

1546
01:02:55.729 --> 01:02:57.269
- A train shot. - Let's start filming a train shot.

1547
01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.168
- It's a train shot. - A train shot.

1548
01:02:59.168 --> 01:03:00.338
I'm dumbfounded.

1549
01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:01.938
It really is a train shot.

1550
01:03:02.838 --> 01:03:04.039
Let's start shooting the Thomas shot.

1551
01:03:05.378 --> 01:03:06.809
The shooting process is so funny.

1552
01:03:06.809 --> 01:03:07.849
Action.

1553
01:03:08.579 --> 01:03:11.278
(The train shot begins...)

1554
01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:14.119
(and they burst into laughter.)

1555
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:16.918
(Why did they crack up to see the train shot?)

1556
01:03:19.659 --> 01:03:21.588
(Crawling)

1557
01:03:21.758 --> 01:03:23.329
(From Thomas' viewpoint)

1558
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:25.128
- It does look like a prank cam. - It's not that bad.

1559
01:03:26.159 --> 01:03:27.168
That looks not bad at all.

1560
01:03:27.168 --> 01:03:29.929
(Ho Dong looks like a baby now.)

1561
01:03:32.838 --> 01:03:36.269
(Ho Dong is on 4 limbs on a variety show for the 1st time ever.)

1562
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:40.208
- He still tries very hard. - I don't look like a human.

1563
01:03:41.608 --> 01:03:43.918
(The train is much slower than expected.)

1564
01:03:43.918 --> 01:03:45.548
- He is on four limbs. - This is crazy.

1565
01:03:45.619 --> 01:03:47.389
- Gosh. This is hilarious. - It is?

1566
01:03:50.289 --> 01:03:51.559
Where is it going?

1567
01:03:51.659 --> 01:03:52.889
Why does it capture us?

1568
01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:54.688
It keeps spinning.

1569
01:03:54.688 --> 01:03:56.028
Where is it going?

1570
01:03:56.028 --> 01:03:57.258
Why does it capture us?

1571
01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:02.469
- The camera... - Goodness.

1572
01:04:02.699 --> 01:04:05.699
(He's flustered.)

1573
01:04:05.699 --> 01:04:07.168
(Thomas keeps spinning again and again.)

1574
01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:08.269
It keeps spinning.

1575
01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:09.769
You got it. Keep spinning.

1576
01:04:12.108 --> 01:04:13.438
Good. It's good now.

1577
01:04:15.108 --> 01:04:16.508
He's trying his best.

1578
01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.418
It's filming his nostril.

1579
01:04:18.418 --> 01:04:20.289
(We're currently filming Kang Ho Dong's "Kicked My Luck Away".)

1580
01:04:20.588 --> 01:04:23.619
(He's trying hard.)

1581
01:04:24.119 --> 01:04:25.418
(What am I doing right now?)

1582
01:04:25.418 --> 01:04:26.418
Good.

1583
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:27.889
- Cut. - Cut.

1584
01:04:28.088 --> 01:04:29.088
Cut.

1585
01:04:29.559 --> 01:04:31.898
- The train shot's good. - Okay.

1586
01:04:31.898 --> 01:04:33.628
Thomas is good. Thomas is good.

1587
01:04:33.628 --> 01:04:36.938
(He's not okay.)

1588
01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:38.539
(Ho Dong, Jin Young, and Hye Ryun's group shot)

1589
01:04:38.539 --> 01:04:39.539
Go.

1590
01:04:39.539 --> 01:04:41.008
(Ho Dong, Jin Young, and Hye Ryun's group shot)

1591
01:04:42.608 --> 01:04:44.278
(Jimmy Jib on a selfie stick)

1592
01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:46.579
- Jimmy Jib? - Jimmy Jib.

1593
01:04:46.579 --> 01:04:47.849
It's comedy.

1594
01:04:48.378 --> 01:04:50.579
It's hard to control.

1595
01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:52.418
We connected five selfie sticks.

1596
01:04:52.418 --> 01:04:53.648
(It's a combination of 5 selfie sticks.)

1597
01:04:55.148 --> 01:04:58.258
(Risky)

1598
01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:00.889
- No! - The idea is good.

1599
01:05:00.889 --> 01:05:03.699
(What happened to the selfie stick Jimmy Jib?)

1600
01:05:04.559 --> 01:05:05.659
What?

1601
01:05:06.159 --> 01:05:08.469
(Jimmy Jib is dead 5 minutes after the shooting.)

1602
01:05:10.168 --> 01:05:12.068
(The last scene)

1603
01:05:12.068 --> 01:05:15.539
(Jimmy Jib is done here.)

1604
01:05:15.539 --> 01:05:18.608
I think they got all the core scenes.

1605
01:05:18.608 --> 01:05:20.878
(Finally they begin shooting in the last studio.)

1606
01:05:22.809 --> 01:05:26.179
(Director Yoo is washing his feet.)

1607
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:28.188
Ho Dong. It's going to be...

1608
01:05:28.188 --> 01:05:29.749
difficult from now on.

1609
01:05:29.749 --> 01:05:31.619
We're almost done.

1610
01:05:31.619 --> 01:05:32.858
We have two scenes left.

1611
01:05:32.858 --> 01:05:35.329
- We're going to use our feet. - Me?

1612
01:05:35.688 --> 01:05:36.898
- Us. - Okay.

1613
01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:38.659
We're going to slap you.

1614
01:05:38.659 --> 01:05:39.659
(We're going to slap you with our feet.)

1615
01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:42.398
(Goodness.)

1616
01:05:42.398 --> 01:05:45.938
I think it's American pranks you watch on every holiday.

1617
01:05:45.938 --> 01:05:47.269
- At the end... - I know, right?

1618
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:48.469
- Right. - Right.

1619
01:05:48.469 --> 01:05:50.278
They go like this at the end.

1620
01:05:50.278 --> 01:05:52.508
Oh, my gosh.

1621
01:05:52.508 --> 01:05:56.349
(Ho Dong will be slapped with feet and spout water in his mouth.)

1622
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:57.349
Ready.

1623
01:05:57.878 --> 01:05:59.418
(First take)

1624
01:05:59.418 --> 01:06:00.418
Action.

1625
01:06:00.588 --> 01:06:02.318
How could you do this to me?

1626
01:06:02.988 --> 01:06:05.188
(Slapping)

1627
01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.528
(Smash)

1628
01:06:08.389 --> 01:06:11.329
(Chuckling)

1629
01:06:11.798 --> 01:06:13.398
- Cut. - Was it good?

1630
01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.128
- Was it good? - I slapped too high.

1631
01:06:15.128 --> 01:06:17.039
Was it good though?

1632
01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.039
(The pain comes late.)

1633
01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:20.168
- Was it good? - It was good.

1634
01:06:20.168 --> 01:06:22.809
He hit my temple. I felt dizzy.

1635
01:06:22.809 --> 01:06:24.079
I moved a bit.

1636
01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:27.278
If you watch in the high-speed camera, my eyes will be turned back.

1637
01:06:27.749 --> 01:06:29.548
(Checking with the high-speed camera)

1638
01:06:29.548 --> 01:06:30.619
Does he spout water?

1639
01:06:31.079 --> 01:06:32.918
- It was good. - It was good.

1640
01:06:33.519 --> 01:06:35.349
If it's a prank, are you going to kill me?

1641
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:36.449
Yes.

1642
01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:38.258
I'll kill you.

1643
01:06:38.258 --> 01:06:39.488
(He's scared.)

1644
01:06:40.219 --> 01:06:41.458
This isn't a prank.

1645
01:06:42.159 --> 01:06:43.829
- This isn't. - Even if it is,

1646
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:45.999
it has to be real now.

1647
01:06:45.999 --> 01:06:48.028
(Even if it is a prank, it has to be real now.)

1648
01:06:48.028 --> 01:06:49.729
Change all the plans.

1649
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:52.269
(Sae Yoon is able to continue his life.)

1650
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:54.309
"It has to be real now."

1651
01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:57.438
Even if it isn't a prank, he'll die.

1652
01:06:57.438 --> 01:06:58.479
(Even if it isn't a prank, he'll die.)

1653
01:06:59.008 --> 01:07:00.878
How could you do this to me?

1654
01:07:01.679 --> 01:07:02.849
(It's a miss.)

1655
01:07:03.179 --> 01:07:04.648
(Whatever. Let me do it again.)

1656
01:07:04.648 --> 01:07:07.648
(Director Yoo's second crisis)

1657
01:07:08.148 --> 01:07:09.519
(He's so shocked that he can't even say anything.)

1658
01:07:09.519 --> 01:07:11.818
- I was so scared. - You have to get it at once.

1659
01:07:12.258 --> 01:07:13.829
Ho Dong. I was too scared to do it.

1660
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.258
(Sae Yoon finally realizes.)

1661
01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:16.628
I was nervous.

1662
01:07:17.059 --> 01:07:18.559
Ho Dong.

1663
01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:20.398
(He's dizzy.)

1664
01:07:21.528 --> 01:07:23.068
- Something to tie. - Hold on.

1665
01:07:24.599 --> 01:07:25.838
He's shocked.

1666
01:07:25.838 --> 01:07:27.309
(Director Yoo's in fear of his life.)

1667
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:30.139
- I'll use the previous one. - Be confident.

1668
01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:31.338
I'm so scared.

1669
01:07:31.338 --> 01:07:32.778
Get it at once. You have to hit me right.

1670
01:07:32.778 --> 01:07:34.809
Let's get it at once.

1671
01:07:34.809 --> 01:07:37.119
He wasn't satisfied.

1672
01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.719
- He wants to try it again. - Yes.

1673
01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:42.289
I was grateful that he volunteered to try it again.

1674
01:07:42.548 --> 01:07:44.258
- As a director. - Did you slap me right this time?

1675
01:07:44.588 --> 01:07:47.028
- Action. - How could you do this to me?

1676
01:07:48.088 --> 01:07:50.188
(Slapping)

1677
01:07:51.099 --> 01:07:53.699
(Will they succeed this time?)

1678
01:07:53.798 --> 01:07:54.798
Come here.

1679
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:56.128
Ho Dong.

1680
01:07:56.128 --> 01:07:57.898
- Good. - My goodness.

1681
01:07:57.898 --> 01:07:59.369
- It was good. - Didn't you hit me with your heel?

1682
01:07:59.369 --> 01:08:00.409
What do you mean it's good?

1683
01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.568
- It was good. - It was good. Okay.

1684
01:08:02.568 --> 01:08:03.608
(The camera director runs away.)

1685
01:08:03.608 --> 01:08:05.238
(Something to tie please.)

1686
01:08:05.238 --> 01:08:06.809
I hear a beep.

1687
01:08:06.809 --> 01:08:08.079
It's a disaster text.

1688
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:09.608
"Disaster text."

1689
01:08:09.608 --> 01:08:10.778
Because of fine dust.

1690
01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:13.479
You sit here. I'll show you.

1691
01:08:13.479 --> 01:08:14.988
(Shivering)

1692
01:08:14.988 --> 01:08:16.748
(Sit here, Sae Yoon.)

1693
01:08:16.748 --> 01:08:17.819
Okay.

1694
01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:19.258
- Good job. - Give me a round of applause.

1695
01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:21.828
(Everyone claps.)

1696
01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:23.599
- Kang Ho Dong. - Yes.

1697
01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:26.929
- Kang Ho Dong. - Kang Ho Dong.

1698
01:08:26.929 --> 01:08:28.668
- Kang Ho Dong. - Kang Ho Dong.

1699
01:08:28.668 --> 01:08:31.998
- Strongest man, Kang Ho Dong. - Kang Ho Dong.

1700
01:08:31.998 --> 01:08:34.868
- Kang Ho Dong. - Kang Ho Dong.

1701
01:08:34.868 --> 01:08:37.139
It's nothing. You can do it too.

1702
01:08:37.139 --> 01:08:38.179
(You can do it too.)

1703
01:08:38.739 --> 01:08:39.739
- What is that? - What is that?

1704
01:08:39.739 --> 01:08:41.309
- Out of nowhere. - Is he running a campaign?

1705
01:08:41.309 --> 01:08:42.408
What are they doing?

1706
01:08:42.408 --> 01:08:45.948
(Preparing for the last scene)

1707
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:48.948
Let me explain.

1708
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:51.118
There will be feet around your face...

1709
01:08:51.118 --> 01:08:53.219
and hit you along the beat.

1710
01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:56.588
You just have to lip-sync insensitively.

1711
01:08:56.588 --> 01:08:58.859
- I'm totally fine. Go as you want. - Okay.

1712
01:08:59.758 --> 01:09:00.769
Good luck.

1713
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:01.929
(He said it bravely, but he's nervous.)

1714
01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:03.298
You're so cool, Kang Ho Dong.

1715
01:09:03.298 --> 01:09:04.899
- Please pay attention. - You're so cool.

1716
01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:07.269
(Director Yoo's monitoring.)

1717
01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:10.168
- The angle is really funny. - I know.

1718
01:09:10.168 --> 01:09:11.508
- I can't see his ears. - Are you ready?

1719
01:09:11.508 --> 01:09:13.878
(His ears are gone.)

1720
01:09:13.878 --> 01:09:14.908
- It's so funny. - His ears.

1721
01:09:14.908 --> 01:09:16.948
- The cameras are ready. - Okay.

1722
01:09:18.019 --> 01:09:19.349
"Kicked My Luck Away".

1723
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:20.418
(First take)

1724
01:09:25.588 --> 01:09:26.719
Lived as I feel like.

1725
01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:28.389
(Slapping)

1726
01:09:28.828 --> 01:09:30.088
(Glancing)

1727
01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:33.128
(Laughing)

1728
01:09:33.128 --> 01:09:35.498
Why did you glance at her? Why?

1729
01:09:35.498 --> 01:09:36.998
He slapped so hard.

1730
01:09:37.698 --> 01:09:38.798
- Goodness. - That hurt.

1731
01:09:38.798 --> 01:09:40.408
(He's embarrassed.)

1732
01:09:40.469 --> 01:09:42.269
I put on red manicure. Should I do it?

1733
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:43.779
- Really? Do you want to? - Is it okay?

1734
01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:44.779
Try.

1735
01:09:44.908 --> 01:09:45.979
Let me try.

1736
01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:48.378
(Jin Young joins after washing her feet.)

1737
01:09:48.378 --> 01:09:51.819
I'll slap him hard at once, or Ho Dong will be too tired.

1738
01:09:51.878 --> 01:09:55.189
- You have to use your feet. - Of course.

1739
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:58.219
- Don't use the heels. - That's it.

1740
01:09:58.219 --> 01:09:59.219
- Good. - Goodness.

1741
01:09:59.219 --> 01:10:00.328
Good.

1742
01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.859
We'll just do it without you.

1743
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:06.029
No. Otherwise, you'll have to take more shots.

1744
01:10:06.029 --> 01:10:07.198
I'll finish it at once.

1745
01:10:07.998 --> 01:10:08.998
(Thump)

1746
01:10:09.368 --> 01:10:10.939
- She's good. - She's good.

1747
01:10:11.368 --> 01:10:12.698
- It's the last. - Okay.

1748
01:10:13.069 --> 01:10:14.139
Music please.

1749
01:10:14.538 --> 01:10:16.609
Relax. Ho Dong. Relax.

1750
01:10:16.609 --> 01:10:17.779
(Murmuring)

1751
01:10:18.208 --> 01:10:25.179
(Everyone's nervous.)

1752
01:10:25.819 --> 01:10:27.448
(Music starts.)

1753
01:10:27.448 --> 01:10:29.149
1, 2, 3, 4.

1754
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:32.788
(Director Yoo keeps the beat.)

1755
01:10:33.118 --> 01:10:35.529
Lived as I feel like

1756
01:10:36.489 --> 01:10:40.328
(Jin Young concentrates without laughing.)

1757
01:10:42.628 --> 01:10:44.899
Kicked my luck away

1758
01:10:44.899 --> 01:10:46.239
(Finally it's the last scene.)

1759
01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:48.668
(The attack is harder than before.)

1760
01:10:48.668 --> 01:10:49.969
Ho Dong. Get out through them.

1761
01:10:51.708 --> 01:10:53.279
(Groaning)

1762
01:10:53.279 --> 01:10:54.609
(He fails to escape.)

1763
01:10:54.908 --> 01:10:57.149
(Laughing)

1764
01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:58.519
(Ho Dong's sacrifice creates the best scene.)

1765
01:10:58.519 --> 01:11:01.219
- That's awesome. - That's awesome.

1766
01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:03.248
- You're amazing. - Your face turned red.

1767
01:11:05.359 --> 01:11:08.729
(The shooting ends with an applause.)

1768
01:11:08.729 --> 01:11:11.029
(Jin Young stayed with them until the end.)

1769
01:11:11.998 --> 01:11:14.599
(He's spaced out.)

1770
01:11:15.998 --> 01:11:17.139
Clap.

1771
01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.498
(Clap!)

1772
01:11:18.599 --> 01:11:21.569
(Kang Ho Dong is the best!)

1773
01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:23.578
Everyone, worship Kang Ho Dong.

1774
01:11:24.939 --> 01:11:26.008
- Are you okay? - It's hilarious.

1775
01:11:26.109 --> 01:11:28.979
- Good job. - Good job.

1776
01:11:28.979 --> 01:11:30.948
- Thank you so much, Jin Young. - Thank you.

1777
01:11:30.948 --> 01:11:33.078
- Thank you so much. - Good job.

1778
01:11:33.548 --> 01:11:34.948
- I'm so grateful. - It's nothing.

1779
01:11:34.948 --> 01:11:36.958
- You're amazing. - Thank you for contacting me.

1780
01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:39.489
- It wasn't a prank. - No.

1781
01:11:39.489 --> 01:11:40.828
To be honest,

1782
01:11:41.529 --> 01:11:43.189
I don't think we'll keep the train shot.

1783
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:44.658
(We won't keep the train shot.)

1784
01:11:45.059 --> 01:11:46.698
It wasn't stable.

1785
01:11:46.698 --> 01:11:49.668
That's when I was sure it was a prank.

1786
01:11:49.668 --> 01:11:52.338
I don't think we can keep it.

1787
01:11:52.698 --> 01:11:54.538
- Good job, everyone. - Good job.

1788
01:11:54.538 --> 01:11:56.739
- Good job. - Good job.

1789
01:11:56.739 --> 01:11:57.739
(Ho Dong's "Kicked My Luck Away" music video is completed.)

1790
01:12:01.479 --> 01:12:05.048
(Splendid choreography)

1791
01:12:05.048 --> 01:12:08.118
(Hilarious comedy)

1792
01:12:09.349 --> 01:12:12.158
("Kicked My Luck Away" is coming soon.)

1793
01:12:13.258 --> 01:12:14.258
You did a great job.

1794
01:12:14.258 --> 01:12:15.658
- It's pretty good. - Yes.

1795
01:12:15.658 --> 01:12:16.899
It's brilliant and cool.

1796
01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.698
- Everyone had a good idea. - Right.

1797
01:12:18.698 --> 01:12:22.298
So we watched the making film of the last team.

1798
01:12:22.298 --> 01:12:25.899
Lee Sang Min had to leave due to another schedule...

1799
01:12:25.899 --> 01:12:27.939
- Unwillingly. - unwillingly.

1800
01:12:27.939 --> 01:12:29.809
I hope you understand.

1801
01:12:29.809 --> 01:12:33.008
Let's meet the new singer, Kang Ho Dong.

1802
01:12:33.008 --> 01:12:34.109
Let's bring him to the stage.

1803
01:12:34.109 --> 01:12:37.448
(He appears ambitiously like a rookie.)

1804
01:12:37.448 --> 01:12:38.779
He's a great dancer.

1805
01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:40.219
(Brother School Film Contest)

1806
01:12:40.219 --> 01:12:47.258

1808
01:12:50.088 --> 01:12:51.758
(Everyone's excited.)

1809
01:12:53.399 --> 01:12:55.168
Kang Ho Dong!

1810
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:58.198
(New singer Kang Ho Dong's ambitious dance)

1811
01:12:58.198 --> 01:12:59.269
- Good. - Good.

1812
01:12:59.368 --> 01:13:01.109
- Good. - Good.

1813
01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:03.038
New singer Kang Ho Dong!

1814
01:13:15.849 --> 01:13:17.618
(Launching stylishness)

1815
01:13:21.788 --> 01:13:23.029
It's not.

1816
01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.708
(It's fun.)

1817
01:13:48.418 --> 01:13:49.519
Good.

1818
01:13:53.088 --> 01:13:54.429
(He's on fire.)

1819
01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:56.258
- All right. - That's good.

1820
01:14:00.429 --> 01:14:03.128
(The stage explodes with swagger.)

1821
01:14:05.569 --> 01:14:06.739
(Getting kicked)

1822
01:14:07.538 --> 01:14:08.569
(Acting cute)

1823
01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:09.868
That was cute.

1824
01:14:09.868 --> 01:14:11.179
- That was cute. - What's going on?

1825
01:14:13.078 --> 01:14:14.849
It's so adorable.

1826
01:14:14.849 --> 01:14:16.809
- 1, 2. - Cutie.

1827
01:14:30.298 --> 01:14:31.559
He's so good.

1828
01:14:34.298 --> 01:14:38.338
(Living life, living life)

1829
01:14:38.338 --> 01:14:42.239
(Sure isn't easy)

1830
01:14:42.338 --> 01:14:45.179
(Now, it's time to take courage)

1831
01:14:45.179 --> 01:14:49.779
(And live to the fullest)

1832
01:14:51.979 --> 01:14:55.489
(I kicked my luck away)

1833
01:14:55.588 --> 01:14:59.118
(You can only dance to the exciting beat.)

1834
01:15:03.088 --> 01:15:04.458
He's so good.

1835
01:15:06.798 --> 01:15:10.269
(I kicked my luck away)

1836
01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.168
(All right, let's go.)

1837
01:15:17.809 --> 01:15:19.439
(Full of swagger)

1838
01:15:23.179 --> 01:15:25.878
(I kicked my luck away)

1839
01:15:28.389 --> 01:15:29.819
(It's an elaborate finish.)

1840
01:15:29.819 --> 01:15:31.889
- What was that? - Amazing.

1841
01:15:32.588 --> 01:15:34.088
- He did an amazing job. - Gosh. Amazing.

1842
01:15:34.288 --> 01:15:36.158
(Amazing)

1843
01:15:38.998 --> 01:15:40.569
- Was that an illusion? - There you go.

1844
01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:41.969
(Screeching)

1845
01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:43.838
- All right. - That was good.

1846
01:15:43.838 --> 01:15:45.599
(It's the cry of a regrettable man who kicked his luck away.)

1847
01:15:45.599 --> 01:15:47.668
All right. We got it.

1848
01:15:48.069 --> 01:15:49.139
(Even the wrap-up is impressionable.)

1849
01:15:49.139 --> 01:15:50.739
- Good work. - Good work.

1850
01:15:50.939 --> 01:15:53.008
- That was the best. - Kang Ho Dong's team...

1851
01:15:53.239 --> 01:15:56.479
had a ton of their budget left. They spent it on firecrackers.

1852
01:15:56.779 --> 01:15:59.649
- That was awesome. - Don't get the wrong impression.

1853
01:15:59.979 --> 01:16:02.448
- What do you think? - Instead of just being funny,

1854
01:16:02.448 --> 01:16:05.059
he took it very seriously. It had a huge effect.

1855
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:06.758
He's now been a wrestler, a show host,

1856
01:16:06.758 --> 01:16:08.529
- and now a singer. - A pop artist.

1857
01:16:08.529 --> 01:16:09.989
- A singer now too. - A wrestling host singer.

1858
01:16:09.989 --> 01:16:11.658
In fact, because...

1859
01:16:11.828 --> 01:16:14.298
he shares the same genre with Kim Yeong Cheol.

1860
01:16:14.298 --> 01:16:17.198
- That's right. - There's quite a competition.

1861
01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.269
How do you feel after hearing the song, Yeong Cheol.

1862
01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:23.639
I think my singing far exceeds his.

1863
01:16:23.639 --> 01:16:25.208
- Is that the end? - All right.

1864
01:16:25.208 --> 01:16:26.679
- Now, presently, - What's going on?

1865
01:16:26.679 --> 01:16:27.948
His comment is over?

1866
01:16:28.048 --> 01:16:30.548
- It's really over? - That's a good wrap up.

1867
01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:34.219
We're taking real-time votes off our main website.

1868
01:16:34.448 --> 01:16:38.719
Please turn in your valuable votes, everyone.

1869
01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.788
- All right. - Now, it's time...

1870
01:16:40.859 --> 01:16:43.158
to view the winning music video.

1871
01:16:43.158 --> 01:16:44.559
- That's right. - But, unfortunately,

1872
01:16:44.559 --> 01:16:48.198
all the other music videos will be made available later...

1873
01:16:48.198 --> 01:16:51.498
at 11pm tonight online.

1874
01:16:51.498 --> 01:16:54.408
But the winning team, will get their music video...

1875
01:16:54.408 --> 01:16:56.439
- fully featured live on stage. - The full version?

1876
01:16:56.439 --> 01:16:59.408
- It's worth doing. - That's really amazing.

1877
01:16:59.408 --> 01:17:02.508
But we need to decide on the order of things.

1878
01:17:02.508 --> 01:17:06.179
But usually, teams that perform first...

1879
01:17:06.179 --> 01:17:07.748
have the advantage in real-time votes.

1880
01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.288
- Really? - They might press it first.

1881
01:17:09.288 --> 01:17:11.859
Because more votes can be expended earlier?

1882
01:17:11.859 --> 01:17:14.328
Therefore, if the three teams...

1883
01:17:14.328 --> 01:17:17.599
can decide on the order, we'll follow through.

1884
01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:19.798
The game that has been chosen for this purpose...

1885
01:17:19.798 --> 01:17:21.498
is "Gather the Glitters".

1886
01:17:21.498 --> 01:17:23.498
- With motivation. - While chanting.

1887
01:17:23.569 --> 01:17:26.399
- The glitter. - Whoever cleans the best.

1888
01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.668
If you bring the total figure back to us...

1889
01:17:29.668 --> 01:17:32.338
You collaborate so well on my wordplay.

1890
01:17:33.208 --> 01:17:34.578
- Fist bump. - Fist bump.

1891
01:17:34.878 --> 01:17:36.309
It's all about the team that brings back the most glitter.

1892
01:17:36.309 --> 01:17:37.578
- For us... - Do you have some for us?

1893
01:17:38.118 --> 01:17:39.719
- Where are you going? - Since it's Lunar New Year's Day,

1894
01:17:39.719 --> 01:17:41.748
let's play a traditional game.

1895
01:17:41.849 --> 01:17:44.118
Let's base it on whoever tosses an object closest to a line.

1896
01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:46.588
- Sure. - You could've said that sitting.

1897
01:17:46.588 --> 01:17:48.489
- My clothes got caught. - All right.

1898
01:17:48.788 --> 01:17:50.758
We'll be tossing beverage caps.

1899
01:17:50.998 --> 01:17:53.029
- Up to this line. - Since we don't have much time,

1900
01:17:53.029 --> 01:17:56.269
- we'll have one person up each. - Just one person each.

1901
01:17:56.399 --> 01:17:57.868
- The directors should go first. - Yes, the directors.

1902
01:17:57.868 --> 01:18:00.139
- You should do it. - Please stand over here.

1903
01:18:00.139 --> 01:18:01.538
The directors should do it.

1904
01:18:01.538 --> 01:18:02.739
Up here, please.

1905
01:18:02.739 --> 01:18:04.779
- Stand over here. - Over there.

1906
01:18:04.779 --> 01:18:06.179
- And toss up to that white line. - Okay.

1907
01:18:06.179 --> 01:18:08.908
- The directors will be doing it. - Please take a seat.

1908
01:18:08.908 --> 01:18:11.378
- What? - It'll be the directors tossing.

1909
01:18:12.519 --> 01:18:13.948
(He scrambles to his seat.)

1910
01:18:13.948 --> 01:18:15.788
I kicked my luck away

1911
01:18:15.788 --> 01:18:18.189
- They're doing it. - Toss it to this white line please.

1912
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:19.758
Each director, please step up.

1913
01:18:19.758 --> 01:18:21.429
Who will be tossing first?

1914
01:18:21.429 --> 01:18:22.628
- I'll go for it. - All right.

1915
01:18:22.628 --> 01:18:25.458
Aim for the white line. It's where I'm standing.

1916
01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:26.859
Just do it.

1917
01:18:30.899 --> 01:18:31.969
(He gives it a light toss.)

1918
01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:35.069
(The first toss already gets pretty close.)

1919
01:18:35.069 --> 01:18:36.538
- He's good. - Nice shot.

1920
01:18:36.538 --> 01:18:38.439
- He looks confident. - I'm terrible at such games.

1921
01:18:38.439 --> 01:18:39.809
- You can't show the countdown? - I can.

1922
01:18:40.139 --> 01:18:41.479
This will be my third.

1923
01:18:41.809 --> 01:18:43.649
- All right. - I'm terrible at such games.

1924
01:18:43.649 --> 01:18:45.748
- Let's go, Eun I. - Pushing is allowed, right?

1925
01:18:45.748 --> 01:18:46.918
- Pushing is allowed, right? - What's going on?

1926
01:18:51.288 --> 01:18:53.088
(Bouncing off)

1927
01:18:53.288 --> 01:18:57.128
Kim Yeong Cheol Team's Eun I is leading right now.

1928
01:18:57.128 --> 01:18:59.359
- You're really something. - We'll go first.

1929
01:18:59.729 --> 01:19:02.029
- You're really something. - We'll go first.

1930
01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:03.639
Gosh.

1931
01:19:03.668 --> 01:19:04.769
Yes.

1932
01:19:04.769 --> 01:19:05.868
(Knee kicking)

1933
01:19:05.868 --> 01:19:07.838
- I kicked my luck away - I kicked my luck away

1934
01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:09.569
- He totally ruined it. - My goodness.

1935
01:19:09.569 --> 01:19:12.378
You have the right to choose, Eun I.

1936
01:19:12.378 --> 01:19:13.779
In which order should we play your work?

1937
01:19:13.779 --> 01:19:15.849
- Where in the order? - I'll...

1938
01:19:15.948 --> 01:19:17.219
be a bit ambitious and pick first.

1939
01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.248
- First? - Yes.

1940
01:19:18.248 --> 01:19:20.179
Okay, now Kim Yeong Cheol...

1941
01:19:20.418 --> 01:19:21.918
and Eun I are first.

1942
01:19:21.989 --> 01:19:24.989
Who's next? It's Sae Yoon.

1943
01:19:25.088 --> 01:19:26.489
- We will... - No, don't.

1944
01:19:26.618 --> 01:19:27.788
Hey, Sae Yoon.

1945
01:19:27.788 --> 01:19:30.059
(Discussing feverishly)

1946
01:19:30.059 --> 01:19:32.828
- We will... - You're not choosing third, right?

1947
01:19:33.198 --> 01:19:34.298
- Yes? - Gosh.

1948
01:19:34.798 --> 01:19:36.569
- He was dead on. - Since we're group three,

1949
01:19:36.569 --> 01:19:37.969
- we'll choose third. - But we did warn you.

1950
01:19:37.969 --> 01:19:39.739
Going sooner might be a bit more favorable.

1951
01:19:39.739 --> 01:19:42.309
- But if we go second... - It might be confusing.

1952
01:19:42.309 --> 01:19:44.739
It might be confusing. We'll choose to go third.

1953
01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:47.208
Then, going second naturally goes to Shin Dong.

1954
01:19:47.208 --> 01:19:49.779
The order begins with Kim Yeong Cheol,

1955
01:19:49.779 --> 01:19:53.219
then Min Kyung Hoon, and finishes with Kang Ho Dong.

1956
01:19:53.219 --> 01:19:54.889
We'll be showing...

1957
01:19:54.889 --> 01:19:57.758
- just exactly half of the video. - Yes, only the first half.

1958
01:19:57.758 --> 01:19:59.489
But we have...

1959
01:19:59.489 --> 01:20:01.158
- such a big twist. - Only the winning team...

1960
01:20:01.158 --> 01:20:02.758
will get to show the full version today.

1961
01:20:02.758 --> 01:20:04.328
But the first half of your video...

1962
01:20:04.328 --> 01:20:06.328
We have a lot of surprises hidden in the second half.

1963
01:20:06.328 --> 01:20:08.198
- It's time for the first team. - Gosh.

1964
01:20:08.269 --> 01:20:11.798
We'll beseeing Eun I's video featuring Yeong Cheol.

1965
01:20:11.998 --> 01:20:13.868
- "Can I?". - "Can I?".

1966
01:20:13.868 --> 01:20:15.908
Let us view it all together.

1967
01:20:15.908 --> 01:20:17.408
We're second.

1968
01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:19.439
What's going on?

1969
01:20:19.439 --> 01:20:20.908
That's Uhm Jung Hwa's first cover picture.

1970
01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:22.748
Oh, gosh.

1971
01:20:23.679 --> 01:20:25.078
I'll be there right away.

1972
01:20:28.048 --> 01:20:29.219
("Can I?")

1973
01:20:29.219 --> 01:20:30.258
(Expressing surprise)

1974
01:20:30.889 --> 01:20:34.158
- It's like a 90's film. - It's slightly childish.

1975
01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:35.989
Wheesung should have been here.

1976
01:20:36.489 --> 01:20:37.729
This is so dramatic.

1977
01:20:41.529 --> 01:20:43.639
He's the highlight of this music video.

1978
01:21:14.998 --> 01:21:16.529
He's in quite a few scenes.

1979
01:21:16.529 --> 01:21:19.069
- He's featured a lot. - He's in too many scenes.

1980
01:21:39.989 --> 01:21:42.458
- Isn't he a good actor? - Yes, he is.

1981
01:21:42.458 --> 01:21:43.998
(Feeling proud)

1982
01:21:51.739 --> 01:21:52.838
What's going on?

1983
01:22:18.198 --> 01:22:19.729
- This is so much fun. - This is good.

1984
01:22:20.059 --> 01:22:21.698
That looks awesome.

1985
01:22:24.269 --> 01:22:25.698
Gosh.

1986
01:22:26.838 --> 01:22:28.838
No, this part should've came out.

1987
01:22:28.838 --> 01:22:30.439
- Uhm Jung Hwa. - This is the limit.

1988
01:22:30.439 --> 01:22:31.878
When does Uhm Jung Hwa come out?

1989
01:22:31.939 --> 01:22:33.779
- How is it? - Vote for what makes you curious.

1990
01:22:33.779 --> 01:22:36.208
Ho Dong, what do you think? Don't you want to watch part two?

1991
01:22:36.779 --> 01:22:38.319
(Laughing)

1992
01:22:38.479 --> 01:22:39.679
What was that?

1993
01:22:39.679 --> 01:22:42.219
- Let's move on. - I won't even watch yours.

1994
01:22:42.219 --> 01:22:46.288
The next one was directed by Shin Dong.

1995
01:22:46.418 --> 01:22:49.889
Yes, featuring our own Kyung Hoon...

1996
01:22:49.889 --> 01:22:51.229
is "Aftereffect".

1997
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:52.298
- Let's take a look. - Let's take a look.

1998
01:22:52.298 --> 01:22:53.399
- I'm full of expectation. - Me too.

1999
01:22:53.399 --> 01:22:55.798
- I'm very curious about this one. - I do want to watch all three.

2000
01:22:55.798 --> 01:22:57.239
Look at that shot.

2001
01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:59.368
- Gosh. - This one is really...

2002
01:23:00.931 --> 01:23:01.931
It's impressive.

2003
01:23:01.931 --> 01:23:03.070
Look at that shot.

2004
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:04.501
- Gosh. - This one...

2005
01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:05.737
- is really... - The font is perfect.

2006
01:23:05.737 --> 01:23:07.237
- It's like a movie. - Mom, I made this.

2007
01:23:07.466 --> 01:23:08.676
Is it fun?

2008
01:23:08.676 --> 01:23:11.476
Kyung Hoon, go to your brother.

2009
01:23:10.807 --> 01:23:12.677
One. Good. How about this one?

2010
01:23:12.677 --> 01:23:13.747
Two.

2011
01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:16.986
Teacher.

2012
01:23:16.986 --> 01:23:18.917
- Hello. - Hello.

2013
01:23:19.516 --> 01:23:21.186
This is heavy, teacher.

2014
01:23:26.427 --> 01:23:27.427
Hurry on in.

2015
01:23:27.427 --> 01:23:29.196
- We have to study Korean. - Okay.

2016
01:23:36.137 --> 01:23:37.866
He's an expert at falling in love.

2017
01:23:39.667 --> 01:23:41.337
He falls in love with pretty much everyone.

2018
01:24:05.396 --> 01:24:08.537
The shots are great, and so is the music.

2019
01:25:02.087 --> 01:25:03.417
I really got scared.

2020
01:25:04.757 --> 01:25:06.226
- The acting is so solid. - He's good.

2021
01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:07.557
He's so good at acting.

2022
01:25:07.557 --> 01:25:08.896
I know. He's good.

2023
01:25:46.097 --> 01:25:47.337
Does it end here?

2024
01:25:47.337 --> 01:25:48.337
(Does it really end here?)

2025
01:25:48.337 --> 01:25:50.606
But it's so good from the second part.

2026
01:25:50.906 --> 01:25:51.906
It's no joke.

2027
01:25:51.906 --> 01:25:54.776
Of course there's Kyung Hoon's fight scene.

2028
01:25:55.576 --> 01:25:57.047
But even apart from that,

2029
01:25:57.547 --> 01:25:59.276
- there's a huge twist. - Vote for us.

2030
01:25:59.276 --> 01:26:00.717
But for that...

2031
01:26:00.717 --> 01:26:02.946
action scene you just mentioned,

2032
01:26:02.946 --> 01:26:05.016
if your team fails to get in first place,

2033
01:26:05.016 --> 01:26:06.047
it might never be shared live.

2034
01:26:06.047 --> 01:26:07.217
- That's true. - That's so harsh.

2035
01:26:07.217 --> 01:26:08.287
(Feeling urgent)

2036
01:26:08.287 --> 01:26:10.856
Why is the tutor cooking in the kitchen though?

2037
01:26:11.356 --> 01:26:12.656
I thought she was a chef too.

2038
01:26:12.656 --> 01:26:14.057
- She's just really close to them. - Is that why?

2039
01:26:14.057 --> 01:26:15.297
She's like family.

2040
01:26:15.297 --> 01:26:18.266
But she should cook after giving her lesson.

2041
01:26:18.266 --> 01:26:19.497
But she was cooking first.

2042
01:26:19.497 --> 01:26:21.196
- That's what she did. - She went to cook afterwards.

2043
01:26:21.196 --> 01:26:22.866
But when it comes to leaving the most suspense,

2044
01:26:22.866 --> 01:26:24.266
the answer should be clear.

2045
01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:26.537
The competition is so fierce. Goodness.

2046
01:26:26.537 --> 01:26:28.707
- For now... - But...

2047
01:26:28.707 --> 01:26:31.047
the title front on the opening scene...

2048
01:26:31.047 --> 01:26:32.476
was so pretty.

2049
01:26:32.476 --> 01:26:34.247
They call that mise-en-scene.

2050
01:26:34.247 --> 01:26:36.417
But it's as if the haziness...

2051
01:26:36.417 --> 01:26:39.946
of the introduction scene and the angle...

2052
01:26:39.946 --> 01:26:42.217
explains the entire mood of the video.

2053
01:26:42.217 --> 01:26:43.316
Are you helping them right now?

2054
01:26:43.316 --> 01:26:44.787
- Oh, my. - I'll also dare to point out...

2055
01:26:44.787 --> 01:26:47.427
that I wrote the title font personally.

2056
01:26:47.427 --> 01:26:48.597
- It's so good. - That's your writing?

2057
01:26:48.927 --> 01:26:50.696
- Yes. - Personally...

2058
01:26:50.696 --> 01:26:53.526
There's only one last music video to view now.

2059
01:26:53.526 --> 01:26:57.366
- The 3rd one. - Yes, only the 3rd one remains.

2060
01:26:57.366 --> 01:26:59.366
"Kicked My Luck Away".

2061
01:26:59.366 --> 01:27:01.507
- "Kicked My Luck Away". - Let's watch together.

2062
01:27:01.507 --> 01:27:03.106
"Can I" kick their luck away?

2063
01:27:03.476 --> 01:27:04.877
(Brother School Film Contest)

2064
01:27:05.106 --> 01:27:06.146
"Kicked My Luck Away".

2065
01:27:09.547 --> 01:27:11.347
(Ho Dong is also watching it for the first time.)

2066
01:27:11.347 --> 01:27:13.217
("Kicked My Luck Away")

2067
01:27:13.217 --> 01:27:14.287
That's a good start.

2068
01:27:44.986 --> 01:27:46.587
(Yeong Cheol sings along at some point.)

2069
01:28:06.106 --> 01:28:07.137
(Chuckling)

2070
01:28:13.717 --> 01:28:14.877
It's very intense.

2071
01:28:20.316 --> 01:28:21.387
(Luck)

2072
01:28:25.087 --> 01:28:26.127
Swagger.

2073
01:28:32.797 --> 01:28:34.467
(It's a strong finish.)

2074
01:28:35.797 --> 01:28:37.307
Hold on. Wasn't that really good?

2075
01:28:37.736 --> 01:28:39.266
- That was neatly done. - It's like an advertisement.

2076
01:28:39.266 --> 01:28:41.906
I know that Sae Yoon...

2077
01:28:41.906 --> 01:28:43.877
films a lot of advertisements.

2078
01:28:43.877 --> 01:28:45.347
It felt like I was watching an advertisement.

2079
01:28:45.347 --> 01:28:47.747
- Yes, for chicken. - Kang Ho Dong's advertisement.

2080
01:28:47.747 --> 01:28:50.316
- That means it has impact. - Of course.

2081
01:28:50.316 --> 01:28:52.486
But definitely, the video...

2082
01:28:52.486 --> 01:28:54.557
had a lot of personality and creativity.

2083
01:28:54.557 --> 01:28:56.757
- The work is great. - That's right.

2084
01:28:56.757 --> 01:28:59.387
But before we commence the final vote,

2085
01:28:59.387 --> 01:29:03.026
each team will take the time to appeal...

2086
01:29:03.026 --> 01:29:04.467
to our viewers.

2087
01:29:04.766 --> 01:29:06.627
- You have 30 seconds. - 30 seconds each.

2088
01:29:06.927 --> 01:29:08.236
First,

2089
01:29:08.236 --> 01:29:10.266
- Kyung Hoon's team, please. - Kyung Hoon's team.

2090
01:29:10.507 --> 01:29:11.967
There is a real...

2091
01:29:11.967 --> 01:29:14.337
twist in the second half.

2092
01:29:14.337 --> 01:29:17.677
Please support us and watch it to the end.

2093
01:29:17.677 --> 01:29:20.616
Please stay tuned for our video.

2094
01:29:20.616 --> 01:29:21.747
We're number one.

2095
01:29:21.747 --> 01:29:23.076
As you witnessed,

2096
01:29:23.076 --> 01:29:25.016
Uhm Jung Hwa didn't have...

2097
01:29:25.016 --> 01:29:26.787
- a single scene in the first half. - That's right.

2098
01:29:26.787 --> 01:29:28.257
For those of you who are curious...

2099
01:29:28.257 --> 01:29:31.526
to see how she featured,

2100
01:29:31.526 --> 01:29:33.726
- get right to pressing number two. - Yes, right away.

2101
01:29:33.726 --> 01:29:35.557
We think our top music video...

2102
01:29:35.557 --> 01:29:36.856
is both funny and inspiring.

2103
01:29:36.856 --> 01:29:37.967
I'm not sure about "inspiring".

2104
01:29:37.967 --> 01:29:39.226
- Okay. - There's a lot of laughter.

2105
01:29:39.226 --> 01:29:41.696
There are plenty of laughs to be had until the end.

2106
01:29:41.696 --> 01:29:43.667
There's no inspiration, but there's plenty of humor.

2107
01:29:43.667 --> 01:29:45.266
To those of you who wish to laugh,

2108
01:29:45.266 --> 01:29:46.766
please press number two without a doubt.

2109
01:29:46.766 --> 01:29:48.606
You'll see why Uhm Jung Hwa...

2110
01:29:48.606 --> 01:29:50.347
came all the way out there on a freezing day.

2111
01:29:50.347 --> 01:29:52.507
- Please, choose number two. - Okay.

2112
01:29:52.707 --> 01:29:55.347
Sae Yoon's brilliance in this music video...

2113
01:29:55.347 --> 01:29:57.587
is truly one of a kind.

2114
01:29:57.587 --> 01:29:59.247
The best of his genius,

2115
01:29:59.247 --> 01:30:03.116
are all included in part two of "Kicked My Luck Away".

2116
01:30:03.116 --> 01:30:05.457
It's not all about scale and picture quality.

2117
01:30:05.457 --> 01:30:06.457
Gosh.

2118
01:30:06.856 --> 01:30:08.927
Their looks too cheap.

2119
01:30:08.927 --> 01:30:11.696
It's not all about scale and picture quality.

2120
01:30:12.167 --> 01:30:14.936
There are scenes that have been left out from the final cut.

2121
01:30:14.936 --> 01:30:18.307
All the tracking shots, aerial shots, and overhead shots...

2122
01:30:18.307 --> 01:30:20.507
are included the second part.

2123
01:30:20.507 --> 01:30:23.606
All things feet-related will be revealed in part two.

2124
01:30:23.606 --> 01:30:25.476
I ask for your support for number three.

2125
01:30:25.476 --> 01:30:26.946
- Number three. - Okay.

2126
01:30:26.946 --> 01:30:28.377
- Two. - Number two.

2127
01:30:28.377 --> 01:30:32.387
Now, we will close the voting.

2128
01:30:32.387 --> 01:30:33.816
Shall we all exclaim together?

2129
01:30:34.116 --> 01:30:39.787
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

2130
01:30:41.097 --> 01:30:42.597
- The end. - Good work, everyone.

2131
01:30:42.597 --> 01:30:43.866
Thank you.

2132
01:30:43.866 --> 01:30:44.896

2133
01:30:45.927 --> 01:30:50.366

2136

(The final winning team will be revealed in a moment.)

2137
01:31:05.547 --> 01:31:06.646
Are the results in?

2138
01:31:06.917 --> 01:31:08.816
The results are in.

2139
01:31:08.816 --> 01:31:12.387
We now present to you first place...

2140
01:31:12.957 --> 01:31:14.696
for this year's first annual Brother School Film Contest.

2141
01:31:14.696 --> 01:31:16.026
(The winning team is revealed.)

2142
01:31:16.967 --> 01:31:17.997
(The hosts seem surprised.)

2143
01:31:17.997 --> 01:31:20.026
(Is it not what they expected?)

2144
01:31:20.396 --> 01:31:21.467
Congratulations.

2145
01:31:21.467 --> 01:31:22.936
(Which team...)

2146
01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.967
(will seize...)

2147

(the victory?)

2148
01:32:27.537 --> 01:32:28.597
Congratulations.

2149
01:31:28.394 --> 01:31:29.863
(Which team...)

2150
01:31:29.863 --> 01:31:31.964
(will seize...)

2151
01:31:31.964 --> 01:31:34.273
(the victory?)

2152
01:31:34.474 --> 01:31:37.804
It's Kyung Hoon's "Aftereffect".

2153
01:31:37.804 --> 01:31:41.613
(Kyung Hoon and Kim Hee Chul take the win.)

2154
01:31:41.613 --> 01:31:43.514
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2155
01:31:44.014 --> 01:31:45.483
Good work.

2156
01:31:45.644 --> 01:31:46.884
I was curious about part two.

2157
01:31:46.884 --> 01:31:47.913
Good work.

2158
01:31:47.913 --> 01:31:49.684
- That's so right. - Great.

2159
01:31:49.684 --> 01:31:50.754
You did a great job.

2160
01:31:50.754 --> 01:31:53.323
- It was awesome. - It's like a movie.

2161
01:31:53.323 --> 01:31:55.754
- It was the best ever. - I admit it too.

2162
01:31:55.754 --> 01:31:56.823
All we did was trying to be funny.

2163
01:31:56.823 --> 01:31:58.294
Please make a comment.

2164
01:31:58.378 --> 01:32:01.348
- I knew we'd win. - Sure.

2165
01:32:01.348 --> 01:32:02.447
How arrogant.

2166
01:32:02.747 --> 01:32:05.388
What I mean is our plot was very well knit...

2167
01:32:05.388 --> 01:32:07.117
What did you just say?

2168
01:32:07.117 --> 01:32:09.388
I mean because the plot was well made,

2169
01:32:09.388 --> 01:32:12.228
people vote for ours to find out the rest of the story.

You deserve it.

2175

Can I?

2184

- Of course, you can. - Can I?

2185
01:32:45.857 --> 01:32:48.397
