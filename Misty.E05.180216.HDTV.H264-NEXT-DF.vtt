<i>They believe Kevin Lee was murdered
and that it wasn't an accident.</i>

4
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.129
<i>The police suspect you.</i>

5
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:25.080
I didn't do it.

6
00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:30.508
I didn't do it!

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.753
The only reason they called you
in to question you

8
00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:38.413
was because they found circumstantial
evidence that points to you.

9
00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.872
Didn't you hear me say it wasn't me?

10
00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:42.610
The best protection
for a suspect is silence.

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.751
Don't say anything, no matter
what they ask you.

12
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:48.476
If you must say something,
discuss it with me first.

13
00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:50.394
We need to buy time...

14
00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:54.245
Hye Ran.

15
00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.187
Who here decided that I'm a suspect?

16
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.849
You called me here saying you
just had a few simple questions.

17
00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.866
You stick me in an interrogation room
and treat me like a suspect?

18
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.587
Was it you? Did you leak it?

19
00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:13.158
No, I'm innocent.

20
00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.486
Do you have evidence that points to me?

21
00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:21.678
Or are you taking a hot case and
accusing a famous person as a suspect?

22
00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:23.977
Do you want your name in the papers?

23
00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:25.388
You're out of line...

24
00:01:25.388 --> 00:01:28.998
The police should catch criminals,
not make them up, Detective.

25
00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:32.209
You people have imprisoned many
innocent people in the past 10 years.

26
00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.629
At least, 10,000 people.
Did you know that?

27
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.399
You were in a car accident
that night, weren't you?

28
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.790
You don't have to answer that.

29
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:02.869
I believe the interview is over.

30
00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.571
If you have more questions,
you can contact me.

31
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:08.212
My car slid on the snowy roads
and I hit a guard rail.

32
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:11.011
Why?

33
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.873
You think I hit Kevin Lee?

34
00:02:14.873 --> 00:02:17.263
- Hye Ran.
- I never said that.

35
00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:19.933
By any chance...

36
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:22.702
did you?

37
00:02:28.588 --> 00:02:30.850
You want me to fall into a trap?

38
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.141
A clumsy investigation where you
try whatever works...

39
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:36.398
Is this how the Korean police
still operates?

40
00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:38.820
- That's enough.
- I'm Go Hye Ran.

41
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.391
I spent half my time as a reporter
going up against prosecutors.

42
00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:44.983
So?

43
00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:47.090
If you're going to go
up against me, do it properly.

44
00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:04.617
If you need a statement regarding
her car accident that night

45
00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.183
I will send you one.

46
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.892
Wow... awesome.

47
00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:20.173
- What about the blackbox?
- Oh, yeah.

48
00:03:20.173 --> 00:03:22.265
I took a look and it's gone.

49
00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:23.953
The chip was taken out.

50
00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.855
What black box?

51
00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:27.244
Whose black box?

52
00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:30.047
You don't mean Go Hye Ran's car, do you?

53
00:03:30.047 --> 00:03:31.601
There was nothing else noticeable?

54
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.863
No, nothing.

55
00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:35.144
Are you people crazy?

56
00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:39.602
You called her in as a witness and
searched her car without a warrant?

57
00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:42.903
What if Go Hye Ran finds out?

58
00:03:42.903 --> 00:03:44.613
Why would you do that?

59
00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:56.672
Don't deal with this emotionally.

60
00:03:56.672 --> 00:04:00.781
I'm not dealing with it emotionally.
I'm being reasonably upset.

61
00:04:00.781 --> 00:04:04.213
The brooch you wore on the news
that day was in Lee Jae Young's car.

62
00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:07.495
That means you were in the car
with Lee Jae Young that day.

63
00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:13.398
Coincidentally, your car
was in an accident that day.

64
00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:16.737
Isn't it obvious that people could
think it was connected to Lee Jae Young?

65
00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:19.018
What about you?

66
00:04:20.377 --> 00:04:21.550
Not the police.

67
00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.177
What do you think?

68
00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.208
For that day...

69
00:04:32.198 --> 00:04:34.997
we need to find someone
who can verify your alibi.

70
00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:40.287
You think the same thing.

71
00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:42.689
You think I killed him.

72
00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.088
Right?

73
00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:51.903
- Let's talk outside.
- Forget it.

74
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.182
A lawyer who doesn't believe me...

75
00:04:56.304 --> 00:04:57.489
I don't need that.

76
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.376
I'm your husband as well as
your lawyer, so listen to me.

77
00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:05.203
That's right. You are my husband.

78
00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:06.242
But...

79
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.569
if you are my husband...

80
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.439
you should've asked if I was okay
before anything else.

81
00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.448
Rather than my alibi,
ask about my feelings and how I am.

82
00:05:18.523 --> 00:05:20.687
You should've worried about that first.

83
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.686
I didn't kill anyone.

84
00:05:48.607 --> 00:05:52.026
I have no reason to avoid anything.

85
00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:05.360
- She's coming!
- There she is!

86
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.506
- Out of the way!
- Move!

87
00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:11.228
Why were you at the police station?

88
00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:14.665
What's your relationship
to Lee Jae Young?

89
00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.648
Please tell us the truth.

90
00:06:16.648 --> 00:06:19.186
Tell us what happened.

91
00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:21.302
- Go Hye Ran!
- Are you responsible for it?

92
00:06:21.302 --> 00:06:23.824
What are your thoughts
on Kevin Lee's death?

93
00:06:23.824 --> 00:06:27.321
They say you are
the only suspect. Is that true?

94
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.722
Lack of detailed knowledge of the case.

95
00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:47.657
A weak investigation
with no clear-cut direction.

96
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:51.494
Rather than looking for the truth,
news that is suggestive and provocative.

97
00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.545
News media that only cares
about pulling in readers.

98
00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:58.374
Irresponsible articles that don't care
about anything besides that.

99
00:06:58.374 --> 00:07:02.794
It's not only your reputations you lose,
but the trust people have in media.

100
00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:06.470
I hope this will not go any further.

101
00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:12.235
Let's try to keep some dignity. Hm?

102
00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:38.684
<i>[Episode 5: Scandal]</i>

103
00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:40.800
Have you heard?

104
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.170
Senior Hye Ran was at the police station.

105
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.456
She and Kevin Lee had something.

106
00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:45.869
Really? What kind of relationship?

107
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:47.648
You know what kind.

108
00:07:47.648 --> 00:07:49.341
You're not even positive.

109
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.268
Hey, hey. Remember his first interview?

110
00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:54.189
The mood between them was really strange.

111
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:56.869
Yes, they did have some sort tension.

112
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:58.477
What tension?

113
00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:01.198
That's when they
were attracted to each other.

114
00:08:01.198 --> 00:08:04.210
Even with that documentary,
Kevin picked her out.

115
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.607
He said it had to be Go Hye Ran.

116
00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:07.658
Well, I don't know.

117
00:08:07.658 --> 00:08:08.958
I guess that's true.

118
00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.718
Wow, that's big news.

119
00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:13.468
Hey, I heard they shared
the same room in Thailand.

120
00:08:13.468 --> 00:08:15.317
- Yes, it seemed that way.
- Huh?

121
00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:17.629
I doubt it. Really?

122
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:19.187
I'm telling you it's true.

123
00:08:19.187 --> 00:08:22.259
The lighting rookie
saw them go in together.

124
00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:23.283
Really?

125
00:08:23.283 --> 00:08:24.903
I heard Go Hye Ran's husband was there.

126
00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:27.317
Wow, she did that with her husband there?

127
00:08:27.317 --> 00:08:28.848
Those two were crazy.

128
00:08:28.848 --> 00:08:30.429
Did you two see it?

129
00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:32.685
- You shocked me.
- Who is this lighting rookie?

130
00:08:32.685 --> 00:08:34.074
Can he stand by what he said?

131
00:08:34.074 --> 00:08:36.540
Hey, what did you say before?

132
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.584
The two of them were so cold to each
other that shooting was difficult.

133
00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:41.689
Wasn't that you?

134
00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:43.936
That's the weird part.

135
00:08:43.936 --> 00:08:46.166
If there was nothing going on,
why would they be cold?

136
00:08:46.166 --> 00:08:47.328
That's more suspicious.

137
00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:48.365
You're right.

138
00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:51.036
Then were they just acting
this whole time.

139
00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:53.093
Wow.

140
00:08:53.093 --> 00:08:57.030
Please don't go around
saying such baseless comments.

141
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.593
You're all reporters.

142
00:08:58.593 --> 00:09:00.644
You talking about things with no facts.

143
00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:03.543
Gossiping about and insulting
a fellow reporter...

144
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.080
Isn't this kind of wrong?

145
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.305
That punk!

146
00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:08.016
- Hold it in.
- Let me go.

147
00:09:08.016 --> 00:09:09.531
That punk always acts this way.

148
00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:10.822
It's Go Hye Ran... Go Hye Ran.

149
00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:16.656
Senior.

150
00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:17.819

than Ji Won's scandal.

They're saying that

- Give me a cigarette.
- A cig... cigarette?

00:10:31.258 --> 00:10:32.347
It's okay.

164
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:40.284
Hye Ran.

165
00:10:40.284 --> 00:10:42.314
Why aren't my clothes here?

166
00:10:42.314 --> 00:10:44.352
What happened is...

167
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.155
an order came down from the bosses.

168
00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:50.001
I don't know what to do.

169
00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:55.974
The news is not a joke.

170
00:10:55.974 --> 00:10:57.574
What are we supposed to do?

171
00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:58.772
What's going to happen?

172
00:11:05.988 --> 00:11:09.231
Uh, Anchor Lee.
Did you get this script?

173
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:10.593
Yes, Team Leader.

174
00:11:11.827 --> 00:11:14.040
Check the headline news once more?

175
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.102
Okay.

176
00:11:16.324 --> 00:11:17.756
- Hey!
- Yes?

177
00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:20.213
Did you turn on all the lights?

178
00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:22.031
Yes, all of them.

179
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:25.083
- All of them are on?
- Yes, all...

180
00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:27.713
What...

181
00:11:27.713 --> 00:11:30.154
What am I supposed to do?

182
00:11:30.154 --> 00:11:33.102
Use reflector panels or something
and get it brighter.

183
00:11:33.102 --> 00:11:36.782
You have to use the reflector panels.
We have to do something.

184
00:11:36.782 --> 00:11:39.150
How's the camera? Have you set it up?

185
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.472
The anchor has changed.
What are you doing huddling there?

186
00:11:42.472 --> 00:11:43.492
Are you dating?

187
00:11:43.492 --> 00:11:44.953
Yes, Sir.

188
00:11:44.953 --> 00:11:45.986
Get to work.

189
00:11:54.354 --> 00:11:55.865
Just look here.

190
00:12:17.074 --> 00:12:21.003
I think I need... an explanation.

191
00:12:21.003 --> 00:12:23.333
You know what
the most fun kind of talking is?

192
00:12:24.814 --> 00:12:26.524
It's making fun of others.

193
00:12:26.524 --> 00:12:28.934
Especially behind the back
of a successful person.

194
00:12:28.934 --> 00:12:32.112
But now, that successful person
has stepped in crap.

195
00:12:32.112 --> 00:12:33.506
What do you think people will do?

196
00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:34.781
I didn't do it.

197
00:12:36.362 --> 00:12:39.488
I had nothing to do
with Kevin Lee's death.

198
00:12:39.488 --> 00:12:42.952
Whether you did or not
isn't important right now.

199
00:12:42.952 --> 00:12:45.920
The problem is that people are
starting to believe you are connected.

200
00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:48.800
So...

201
00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:54.492
you're going to end me like this?

202
00:12:54.492 --> 00:12:57.352
It'll be announced tomorrow
at an emergency meeting.

203
00:12:57.352 --> 00:12:59.827
You'll have to go on probation
and wait for now.

204
00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:02.107
I haven't done anything wrong,
so why am I on probation?

205
00:13:02.107 --> 00:13:03.176
Hye Ran!

206
00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:05.426
Go and wait.

207
00:13:05.426 --> 00:13:07.596
It wasn't me.

208
00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:09.309
I didn't do it, Director!

209
00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:10.497
Go and wait.

210
00:13:20.844 --> 00:13:25.890
<i>We have news on pro golfer,
Kevin Lee, who died on the 18th.</i>

211
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.194
<i>There's a chance that it was murder
and not an accident.</i>

212
00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:32.274

last year and returned...</i>

213

<i>This is the place
where Kevin Lee lost his life.</i>

214
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:37.878
<i>It is a steep road with poor visibility.</i>

215
00:13:37.878 --> 00:13:40.583
<i>There was a snowstorm
on the day of the accident.</i>

216
00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:42.083
<i>Kevin Lee was...</i>

217
00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:51.798
What am I to do?

218
00:13:59.824 --> 00:14:03.267
I know it is difficult,
but I'd like to confirm a few things.

219
00:14:05.038 --> 00:14:09.538
Do you happen to know why
your husband went out that night?

220
00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:13.636
No.

221
00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:20.977
Were you home all day yesterday?

222
00:14:22.776 --> 00:14:23.856
Yes.

223
00:14:25.044 --> 00:14:28.705
I wasn't feeling well,
so I fell asleep early.

224
00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:43.367
I see.

225
00:14:45.828 --> 00:14:49.208
I know this may not be
the right time to bring this up.

226
00:14:50.376 --> 00:14:55.405
Still, I feel this is something we should
do to know what exactly happened.

227
00:14:57.205 --> 00:14:58.785
About an autopsy...

228
00:15:01.597 --> 00:15:03.077
will you agree to do one?

229
00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:06.726
An autopsy?

230
00:15:06.726 --> 00:15:08.775
I don't mean anything by it.

231
00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:10.535
I know this was a car accident.

232
00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:13.716
But, it isn't clear who
was the victim or the perpetrator.

233
00:15:13.716 --> 00:15:17.678
We sometimes do autopsies
to find out more details.

234
00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:20.535
My husband...

235
00:15:21.506 --> 00:15:23.242
You don't think it was an accident?

236
00:15:23.242 --> 00:15:25.163
That's what I'm trying to confirm.

237
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.959
Oh, it's cold.

238
00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.434
When are you going to check
Kevin Lee's timeline?

239
00:16:20.115 --> 00:16:21.755
I'll do it tomorrow.

240
00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:23.179
Did you check his home CCTV?

241
00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:26.030
Check the exact time he left his home.

242
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.101
Okay.

243
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.242
By the way...

244
00:16:30.242 --> 00:16:32.694
why do you think it was murder?

245
00:16:34.252 --> 00:16:36.703
Do you really think
Go Hye Ran killed him?

246
00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:49.819
<i>The autopsy of Kevin Lee, who died

00:17:07.202 --> 00:17:11.242
<i>Most autopsies take anywhere
from a week to one month.</i>

253
00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:17.202
Yes, Hye Ran.

254
00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:20.720
Yes.

255
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.351
I decided to do the autopsy.

256
00:17:23.332 --> 00:17:25.069
The police wanted to do it.

257

<i>[Not A Simple Accident, Autopsy Needed]</i>

258
00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:30.194
I thought it would be for the best.

259
00:17:30.194 --> 00:17:31.272
Sorry.

260
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.084
I know you cared about him.

261
00:17:35.084 --> 00:17:37.310
Now, it's difficult for you
because of this.

262
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.789
Don't worry about it.

263
00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:42.860
Though it is a bit difficult.

264
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:45.503
I can resolve it.

265
00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:50.992
By the way, how are you?

266
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.721
Are you okay all alone?

267
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:56.451
Yes.

268
00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:58.301
I can handle it.

269
00:17:58.301 --> 00:17:59.374
Oh, yeah.

270
00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:04.365
We'll be having a funeral
after the autopsy.

271
00:18:05.425 --> 00:18:07.555
You'll be there, right?

272
00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:11.823
Of course.

273
00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.223
He was your husband.

274
00:18:15.223 --> 00:18:17.865

That dead golfer.

In order to be your lawyer...

305
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.831
You said you were going to be my lawyer.

306
00:21:45.944 --> 00:21:48.118
Why can't you ask me yourself?

307
00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:51.485
Are you afraid of what I'll say?

308
00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:54.828
You can't even handle that and
you said you'd be my lawyer?

00:21:58.768 --> 00:21:59.797
Fine.

310
00:22:01.126 --> 00:22:02.856
I'll tell you only the truth.

311
00:22:05.297 --> 00:22:06.706

How will you explain

Ask the right question, Kang Tae Wook.

I didn't sleep with him.

You don't believe me?

321
00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:38.713
Too bad. What's our relationship then?

322
00:22:38.713 --> 00:22:41.944
I told you. He was a guest
and I interviewed him.

323
00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:44.965
There's one more thing.
He's my friend's husband.

324
00:22:44.965 --> 00:22:48.405
There... I've told you everything.

325
00:22:48.405 --> 00:22:50.005
What else do you want to know?

326
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.734
You said you would tell me the truth.

327
00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:55.742
I am telling you the truth.
Why won't you believe me?

328
00:22:57.423 --> 00:23:00.684
I've had hundreds of guests
on my news show.

329
00:23:00.684 --> 00:23:06.344
I've had meetings, meals, coffee,
and drinks with guests many times.

330
00:23:06.344 --> 00:23:08.533
Any time one of them dies in an accident

331
00:23:08.533 --> 00:23:10.915
will I become a suspect and be doubted?

332
00:23:13.942 --> 00:23:15.152
Tae Wook.

333
00:23:16.808 --> 00:23:19.370
Are you trying to be my lawyer?

334
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.071
Or are you trying to confirm
your suspicions?

335
00:23:26.815 --> 00:23:28.770
It doesn't matter even if you killed him.

336
00:23:32.841 --> 00:23:36.682
It won't change my mind
about wanting to be your lawyer.

337
00:23:40.132 --> 00:23:41.800
I didn't kill him!

338
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.316
I didn't sleep with him, you bastard!

339
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.291
<i>What is it?</i>

340
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:35.988
<i>You don't actually
love your husband, do you?</i>

341
00:24:45.492 --> 00:24:46.796
Your husband.

342
00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:51.600
Do you love him?

343
00:24:57.883 --> 00:24:59.765
<i>He was the first person.</i>

344
00:25:01.005 --> 00:25:05.735
<i>The first person to love me,
all of me, just as I am.</i>

345
00:25:11.515 --> 00:25:12.669
What about you?

346
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.399
Do you love me?

347
00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:25.414
I felt that way about you.

348
00:25:26.654 --> 00:25:28.023
You and I...

349
00:25:28.943 --> 00:25:31.393
were young, and it was passionate.

350
00:25:32.943 --> 00:25:34.364
In that moment...

351
00:25:36.053 --> 00:25:37.551
you were all that I had.

352
00:25:39.894 --> 00:25:41.664
What kind of game are you playing now?

353
00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:43.717
Every once in a while, in my life...

354
00:25:45.388 --> 00:25:48.018
I thought of you whenever
I was tired, or things were tough.

355
00:25:49.212 --> 00:25:51.394
When I thought of you...

356
00:25:52.831 --> 00:25:55.432
I returned back to those times
when I liked you.

357
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.901
It made me feel better.

358
00:26:00.817 --> 00:26:04.283
Just thinking about the time
I spent with you...

359
00:26:06.376 --> 00:26:10.292
Even 10 years, and
another 10 years after that...

360
00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:13.457
I still want to feel that way.

361
00:26:14.969 --> 00:26:18.686
I don't want to remember you
with hatred and anger.

362
00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:22.736
Let me remember you
as a man I loved, Jae Young.

363
00:26:25.098 --> 00:26:26.687
So, you loved me?

364
00:26:27.598 --> 00:26:29.059
You expect me to believe that?

365
00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:30.549
Just like you said...

366
00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:35.018
we just didn't legally register it,
but we were like a married couple.

367
00:26:36.038 --> 00:26:39.828
If I didn't love you,
how could I be with you that long?

368
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:45.008
Then what about your husband?

369
00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:50.223
Do you love him too?

370
00:27:02.529 --> 00:27:03.635
I need him.

371
00:27:05.355 --> 00:27:06.665
That's all it is?

372
00:27:09.526 --> 00:27:10.705
That's all it is.

373
00:28:27.097 --> 00:28:29.763
<i>What is the nature of their relationship?</i>

374
00:28:34.195 --> 00:28:36.645
What do you mean by that?

375
00:28:37.517 --> 00:28:39.274
Kevin Lee and Hye Ran.

376
00:28:44.253 --> 00:28:46.050
When did they first start up?

377
00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:53.142
Why are you being
like this too, Tae Wook?

378
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:57.577
Don't you know that Go Hye Ran
is not that kind of woman?

379
00:28:59.407 --> 00:29:01.117
I thought I knew.

380
00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.567
Now, I'm less certain about it.

381
00:29:06.219 --> 00:29:08.050
Back when she had
the abortion, and even now.

382
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:13.478
I feel like I know her less and less.

383
00:29:29.224 --> 00:29:31.434
I didn't sleep with him, you bastard!

384
00:29:31.434 --> 00:29:33.191
<i>Why are you being so naive?</i>

385
00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:35.970
Men and women have something
chemical that draws them to each other.

386
00:29:36.994 --> 00:29:39.194
That's a whole different issue,
Lawyer Kang.

387
00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.729
<i>[Search Warrant]</i>

388
00:30:01.729 --> 00:30:04.364
I'd like a search warrant
for Go Hye Ran's car.

389
00:30:04.364 --> 00:30:06.534
The autopsy results are not back yet.

390
00:30:06.534 --> 00:30:08.883
Give me the warrant before then.

391
00:30:08.883 --> 00:30:11.692
I'm concerned that we will
lose evidence if we delay.

392
00:30:11.692 --> 00:30:13.012
Senior.

393
00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:17.152
Let's talk comfortably to each other.

394
00:30:18.704 --> 00:30:19.743
Talk.

395
00:30:19.743 --> 00:30:23.143
There's a good chance
this will be a simple car accident.

396
00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:25.175
If that's what happens...

397
00:30:25.175 --> 00:30:28.274
you won't get an honorary retirement.

398
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:31.478
You're going up against Go Hye Ran.

399
00:30:31.478 --> 00:30:35.356
She's an anchor known by the whole
country. And she is a former reporter.

400
00:30:35.356 --> 00:30:37.856
- Ki Hoon.
- Yes, go on.

401
00:30:37.856 --> 00:30:39.185
You know Kevin Lee, right?

402
00:30:41.436 --> 00:30:43.229
He was an athlete.

403
00:30:43.229 --> 00:30:46.259
Would someone like that die
from an accident like that?

404
00:30:46.259 --> 00:30:47.628
He didn't even brake.

405
00:30:47.628 --> 00:30:48.809
Because he was drunk.

406
00:30:48.809 --> 00:30:51.730
The air bag went off in his face,
but there are no marks on his face.

407
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.850
Why do you think that is?

408
00:30:53.898 --> 00:30:56.109
Because he was already dead.

409
00:30:56.109 --> 00:30:59.300
You can't get a warrant
if all you have is a theory.

410
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.427
Get evidence.

411
00:31:00.427 --> 00:31:02.513
Give me a warrant.
I'll find the evidence.

412
00:31:02.513 --> 00:31:06.004
I'll get her call logs,
navigation record, and her black box.

413
00:31:06.004 --> 00:31:07.834
Then we can track her movements.

414
00:31:09.605 --> 00:31:11.108
Wait for the autopsy results.

415
00:31:11.108 --> 00:31:13.220
I'll give you the warrant
once you have Go Hye Ran.

416
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.541
- Ki Hoon.
- Senior.

417
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:17.376
You know what happens
if you mess with the press.

418
00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:20.460
We won't be the police anymore,
we'll be the ones people are watching.

419
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.550
We can't take on that burden.

420
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.731
Wait for the autopsy results.
We'll talk then.

421
00:31:43.764 --> 00:31:46.485
I've been a detective for 30 years.

422
00:31:46.485 --> 00:31:49.698
I knew right away
when I saw the crime scene.

423
00:31:49.698 --> 00:31:51.930
It wasn't a simple accident.

424
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.012
Wait and see.

425
00:31:58.371 --> 00:31:59.858
Director Jang.

426
00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:02.479
How are you managing your team?

427
00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:05.359
JBC's main anchor
has been accused of murder?

428
00:32:05.359 --> 00:32:07.796
This is something
that should be in the news.

429
00:32:09.078 --> 00:32:10.698
I apologize.

430
00:32:10.698 --> 00:32:12.759
How were the ratings yesterday?

431
00:32:12.759 --> 00:32:14.498
Ah...

432
00:32:14.498 --> 00:32:17.195
They fell six percent
from the previous day.

433
00:32:17.195 --> 00:32:20.317
What? Not 0.6 but 6?

434
00:32:20.317 --> 00:32:23.667
Are you maintaining the advertisers?

435
00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:26.837
Currently, four have pulled out.

436
00:32:26.837 --> 00:32:28.245
- Team Leader Woong.
- Yes?

437
00:32:28.245 --> 00:32:29.759
- Come here.
- Yes.

438
00:32:31.507 --> 00:32:32.805
You little...

439
00:32:34.205 --> 00:32:35.520
What were you doing?

440
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.839
When Go Hye Ran got called by the police,
you should've had a plan.

441
00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:41.460
Lee Yeon Jung? How could you use her?

442
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.109
I'm sorry.

443
00:32:43.109 --> 00:32:47.546
I want to hear plans on how to get it
back up six percent by tomorrow morning.

444
00:32:47.546 --> 00:32:48.636
Report to me.

445
00:32:48.636 --> 00:32:50.694
As for Go Hye Ran...

446
00:32:51.725 --> 00:32:53.196
we'll discuss that afterward.

447
00:33:00.188 --> 00:33:03.143
Director, why don't we just call
Han Ji Won back from Daejeon?

448
00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.142
Give me a cigarette.

449
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:11.232
Vice President is being so harsh.

450
00:33:11.232 --> 00:33:14.588
How can we get six percent
back overnight?

451
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.922
Is there no possibility with Go Hye Ran?

452
00:33:27.922 --> 00:33:30.415
Director, you have to let it go.

453
00:33:30.415 --> 00:33:32.642
We're in no position
to worry about Go Hye Ran.

454
00:33:32.642 --> 00:33:36.636
You and I could both get fired
if we let emotions get in our way.

455
00:33:47.882 --> 00:33:49.262
Oh, my head hurts.

456
00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:54.474
The medical diagnosis of the injuries
sustained by the victim

457
00:33:54.474 --> 00:33:58.904
describes his injuries
and the degree of them.

458
00:33:58.904 --> 00:34:02.934
The diagnosis does not prove
the defendant was behind the assault.

459
00:34:02.934 --> 00:34:05.303
It cannot be used as evidence.

460
00:34:05.303 --> 00:34:09.203
Therefore, based on Criminal Code 260

461
00:34:09.203 --> 00:34:12.964
and Criminal Procedure Code 308

462
00:34:12.964 --> 00:34:15.475
the defendant is found not guilty.

463
00:34:35.095 --> 00:34:37.901
Oh, Lawyer Kang. So much charisma.

464
00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:38.935
I like it.

465
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.665
Congratulations, Senior.

466
00:34:45.468 --> 00:34:47.975
You finally won.

467
00:34:47.975 --> 00:34:50.774
Your wife is the best.

468
00:34:50.774 --> 00:34:53.486
She said she supported your convictions.

469
00:34:53.486 --> 00:34:55.785
She even did that news story for you.

470
00:34:55.785 --> 00:34:57.897
The media is amazing.

471
00:34:57.897 --> 00:35:00.776
We could have won without the news.

472
00:35:00.776 --> 00:35:02.055
Oh, right...

473
00:35:04.057 --> 00:35:05.615
Is your wife okay?

474
00:35:07.568 --> 00:35:09.055
Yes, she is.

475
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:11.539
That's a relief.

476
00:35:11.539 --> 00:35:15.984
My wife tells me things aren't
good for her in the newsroom.

477
00:35:15.984 --> 00:35:19.336
Even the vice president
is pressuring her.

478
00:35:19.336 --> 00:35:23.325
It seems a comeback
on News Nine may be difficult.

479
00:35:23.325 --> 00:35:24.955
It must be tough.

480
00:35:24.955 --> 00:35:28.714
Honestly, people like us in law
don't like to get mixed up with family.

481
00:35:28.714 --> 00:35:31.361
It really is low-class work.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.972
What is it? Just say it.

484
00:35:55.972 --> 00:35:58.501
Uh, well, yes.

485
00:35:58.501 --> 00:36:00.499
Honestly...

486
00:36:00.499 --> 00:36:02.051
the mood out there is not good.

487
00:36:02.051 --> 00:36:04.271
Of course, I believe Anchor Go Hye Ran.

488
00:36:04.271 --> 00:36:07.578
I've seen how much she loves you.

489
00:36:07.578 --> 00:36:11.030
Why would she be with
that golfer? What nonsense.

490
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.970
People gossip so much.

491
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.919
Everywhere you go,
they're having a blast gossiping.

492
00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:19.399
It's not like they know.

493
00:36:19.399 --> 00:36:22.142
Is this an unlucky year
for your birth year, by any chance?

494
00:36:24.705 --> 00:36:28.707
Anyway, everywhere you go...

495
00:36:28.707 --> 00:36:32.267
it is true that things
don't look so good.

496
00:36:44.787 --> 00:36:45.990
Yes, Mother.

497
00:36:48.107 --> 00:36:49.906
<i>He looked very tired.</i>

498
00:36:50.845 --> 00:36:52.097
<i>I mean Tae Wook.</i>

499
00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:55.531
<i>Did you talk to him?</i>

500
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:56.999
<i>You should console him.</i>

501
00:36:56.999 --> 00:36:58.428
I'm busy right now.

502
00:36:58.428 --> 00:37:00.879
This isn't the time to put up walls.

503
00:37:00.879 --> 00:37:02.479
In this situation

504
00:37:02.479 --> 00:37:06.544
Tae Wook is the only person
who will take your side.

505
00:37:06.544 --> 00:37:08.272
- <i>Talk to him...</i>
- I'm hanging up.

506
00:37:28.406 --> 00:37:31.513
What are you doing
to manage your household?

507
00:37:31.513 --> 00:37:34.175
I'm so embarrassed
that I can't hold my head up.

508
00:37:34.175 --> 00:37:37.622
Don't listen to people.
It's not true.

509
00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:42.024
- She was just a witness.
- Go Hye Ran and Kevin Lee.

510
00:37:42.024 --> 00:37:43.767
Are you envious?

511
00:37:43.767 --> 00:37:48.381
You should quit soccer and play golf.

512
00:37:48.381 --> 00:37:51.490
Even a cold woman
like Go Hye Ran fell for him.

513
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.468
Organize things and split up for good.

514
00:37:54.468 --> 00:37:56.481
They even went abroad together.

515
00:37:56.481 --> 00:37:58.890
I hear things were insane there too.

516
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.050
Did they sleep together?

517
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.271
I no longer want to see her.

518
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:05.537
I can't let it go this time.

519
00:38:05.537 --> 00:38:10.426
My friend's cousin's friend's husband
is part of the crew.

520
00:38:10.426 --> 00:38:13.015
- They apparently shared the same room.
- Hey.

521
00:38:13.015 --> 00:38:15.703
- Are you listening to me?
- They slept together.

522
00:38:15.703 --> 00:38:20.084
Do you think Go Hye Ran seduced him,
or was it Kevin Lee who seduced her?

523
00:38:20.084 --> 00:38:21.484
It's obvious, isn't it?

524
00:38:21.484 --> 00:38:24.263
Have you seen the look
in Go Hye Ran's eyes, and that body?

525
00:38:24.263 --> 00:38:27.707
- What kind of guy would say no?
- Tae Wook.

526
00:38:27.707 --> 00:38:29.939
Image is everything in broadcasting.

527
00:38:29.939 --> 00:38:31.973
I guess she's the opposite in reality.

528
00:38:31.973 --> 00:38:34.664
One woman anchor is going to
destroy that station...

529
00:38:35.834 --> 00:38:37.510
Hey! Who are you?

530
00:38:42.292 --> 00:38:44.171
<i>[Lawyer Tae Wook]</i>
Sue me.

531
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.140
What are you doing
in front of your mother?

532
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:55.832
She is my wife.

533
00:38:55.832 --> 00:38:58.559
The whole world can point their
fingers at her and curse her.

534
00:38:58.559 --> 00:39:02.289
I... will be by her side.

535
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.479
I will have them point their fingers at
me and have them curse me too.

536
00:39:07.508 --> 00:39:09.323
Because I am her husband.

537
00:39:29.086 --> 00:39:31.176
<i>I don't love you.</i>

538
00:39:31.176 --> 00:39:33.457
Is that okay?

539
00:39:33.457 --> 00:39:34.635
I love you.

540
00:39:36.345 --> 00:39:39.720
<i>It's enough if I love you.</i>

541
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:50.406
Manager Jung, it's me.

542
00:39:51.524 --> 00:39:54.995
Please find all the negative,
baseless articles about my wife.

543
00:39:54.995 --> 00:39:57.575
I will be suing them for defamation.

544
00:39:57.575 --> 00:39:59.825
Find the papers
and reporters' names for me.

545
00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:04.214
Yes.

546
00:40:04.214 --> 00:40:07.104
I will be starting my defense now.

547
00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:08.185
Please prepare.

548
00:40:09.028 --> 00:40:10.947
<i>[Resignation]</i>

549
00:40:13.328 --> 00:40:14.522
It's my resignation.

550
00:40:16.394 --> 00:40:18.115
<i>[Resignation]</i>

551
00:40:20.707 --> 00:40:21.950
It's my resignation.

552
00:40:22.983 --> 00:40:24.110
What are you doing?

553
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.599
You can figure it out, Director.

554
00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:31.602
So, you're innocent enough that
you're willing to use your last card.

555
00:40:31.602 --> 00:40:33.023
Is that it?

556
00:40:33.023 --> 00:40:35.273
Thank you for everything.

557
00:40:35.273 --> 00:40:36.651
Stay healthy.

558
00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:39.996
Give up on being
the Blue House press secretary.

559
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:45.921
I only have one neck.

560
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.061
I can't put my neck on the line for
someone who's going to leave soon.

561
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.012
What do you want to do?

562
00:40:56.825 --> 00:40:58.159
You choose.

563
00:41:08.896 --> 00:41:11.651
Director! No, this isn't right.

564
00:41:11.651 --> 00:41:14.689
What are you thinking?
I'm sorry.

565
00:41:14.689 --> 00:41:18.090
This is like you're killing yourself.

566
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:19.175
Oh Dae Woong.

567
00:41:20.396 --> 00:41:22.666
What do you think the news is?

568
00:41:23.706 --> 00:41:24.794
The news?

569
00:41:26.385 --> 00:41:28.240
Well, the news...

570
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.939
Justice, truth in our world.

571
00:41:30.939 --> 00:41:33.671
It's all a show in the end, a show.

572
00:41:33.671 --> 00:41:36.858
A show, a show that delivers facts.

573
00:41:36.858 --> 00:41:37.950
A show?

574
00:41:39.072 --> 00:41:42.168
Go Hye Ran will be on News Nine.

575
00:41:42.168 --> 00:41:45.898
How will Go Hye Ran
get that six percent back?

576
00:41:45.898 --> 00:41:48.360
Aren't you curious? I am.

577
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.869
What if the ratings drop even more?

578
00:41:50.869 --> 00:41:53.168
What if people protest?

579
00:41:53.168 --> 00:41:55.117
Director!

580
00:41:55.117 --> 00:41:57.938
10 minutes to air.
I'm heading down.

581
00:41:57.938 --> 00:41:59.021
All right.

582
00:42:19.883 --> 00:42:22.048
Regarding the press secretary offer...

583
00:42:23.178 --> 00:42:25.099
I think we will have to rescind that.

584
00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:30.639
Was that the decision
of the Senior Press Secretary?

585
00:42:30.639 --> 00:42:33.439
I will report it to him once I get back.

586
00:42:35.628 --> 00:42:38.077
I see. I understand.

587
00:42:43.331 --> 00:42:46.526
If it's okay with you

588
00:42:46.526 --> 00:42:50.517
could you report back to him once
you see me on News Nine tonight?

589
00:42:50.517 --> 00:42:54.088
Were you not let go from News Nine?

590
00:42:55.738 --> 00:42:58.497
It's true that broadcasting
can be a cold industry.

591
00:42:58.497 --> 00:43:01.619
But, they do not
take away one's livelihood

592
00:43:01.619 --> 00:43:04.742
just for being questioned as a witness.

593
00:43:04.742 --> 00:43:05.867
So...

594
00:43:19.856 --> 00:43:21.258
Gosh!

595
00:43:25.322 --> 00:43:26.588
Team Leader Woong.

596
00:43:26.588 --> 00:43:28.539
Will it be okay for Go Hye Ran to go on?

597
00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:30.005
I really don't know.

598
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:32.979
Stand by!

599
00:43:36.427 --> 00:43:38.075
Studio, stand by.

600
00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:48.240
Hello to all our viewers.

601
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.898
I am Go Hye Ran on JBC's News Nine.

602
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.628
<i>Before I start the news today</i>

603
00:43:55.628 --> 00:43:59.834
<i>I feel I must say something
to help you understand.</i>

604
00:44:01.814 --> 00:44:04.325
<i>As it was reported on the news yesterday</i>

605
00:44:04.325 --> 00:44:09.003
<i>I was questioned by the police as
a witness regarding Kevin Lee's death.</i>

606
00:44:10.334 --> 00:44:14.704
<i>The police believe that this
was not a simple car accident.</i>

607
00:44:16.006 --> 00:44:17.863
<i>There are many articles
all over the internet</i>

608
00:44:17.863 --> 00:44:22.829
<i>hypothesizing that I am
the prime suspect.</i>

609
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:26.481
<i>I want to tell everyone that I am
still just a reference witness.</i>

610
00:44:29.247 --> 00:44:34.207
<i>I would like to ask that articles
expanding on this hypothesis stop.</i>

611
00:44:35.677 --> 00:44:38.889
Unfortunately, this incident
is in the public domain.

612
00:44:38.889 --> 00:44:41.468
I felt it was best
to be clear and honest.

613
00:44:41.468 --> 00:44:43.816
That is how I feel and how JBC feels.

614
00:44:45.023 --> 00:44:48.803
If I am needed for the investigation,
I will continue to cooperate.

615
00:44:48.803 --> 00:44:54.534
Until the truth comes to light,
I will continue on with News Nine.

616
00:44:59.691 --> 00:45:04.102
As Go Hye Ran's News Nine has always done

617
00:45:04.102 --> 00:45:07.001
we will continue to be
impartial and transparent.

618
00:45:07.001 --> 00:45:09.503
That is how we
will approach you, the viewers.

619
00:45:12.032 --> 00:45:14.255
<i>Now, on to our first news item.</i>

620
00:45:16.784 --> 00:45:18.668
She is cool, as always.

621
00:45:18.668 --> 00:45:20.030
Don't you agree?

622
00:45:21.639 --> 00:45:23.043
Is that the list of people to sue?

623
00:45:23.043 --> 00:45:24.776
Ah, yes.

624
00:45:24.776 --> 00:45:28.564
Why don't we get all the people
who put up bad rumors too?

625
00:45:28.564 --> 00:45:30.055
Let's sue them all.

626
00:45:42.869 --> 00:45:44.702
<i>[Vice President]</i>

627
00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:53.081
Go Hye Ran knows the news.

628
00:45:55.463 --> 00:45:57.084
She knows the news.

629
00:45:57.983 --> 00:45:59.628
That's all for Go Hye Ran's News Nine.

630
00:45:59.628 --> 00:46:02.128
- Thank you.
- Signal, stand by. Signal.

631
00:46:02.128 --> 00:46:03.195
Start.

632
00:46:31.898 --> 00:46:34.811
You worked hard.
You were awesome, Senior.

633
00:46:38.278 --> 00:46:39.550
Great job.

634
00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.860
You did great.

635
00:46:49.396 --> 00:46:50.488
Thanks.

636
00:47:33.409 --> 00:47:34.530
What is it?

637
00:47:36.432 --> 00:47:38.622
Let me ask you one thing.

638
00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:40.296
You have more to ask me?

639
00:47:41.517 --> 00:47:44.568
What did you do with the black box chip?

640
00:47:52.456 --> 00:47:53.577
I don't know.

641
00:47:54.916 --> 00:47:56.128
You don't know?

642
00:47:56.128 --> 00:47:59.577
They checked at the auto mechanic
and it was already gone.

643
00:47:59.577 --> 00:48:01.175
It wasn't there.

644
00:48:01.175 --> 00:48:03.979
The chip wasn't there
when the car came in.

645
00:48:03.979 --> 00:48:06.959
I wondered if it was sent
to the insurance company.

646
00:48:06.959 --> 00:48:08.059
Oh.

647
00:48:09.117 --> 00:48:10.988
Really?

648
00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:12.829
Honestly...

649
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:16.617
I thought they lost it at the mechanic,
but they said it was never there.

650
00:48:16.617 --> 00:48:19.459
I don't know what happened,
so it's driving me crazy.

651
00:48:20.459 --> 00:48:23.510
It's the only thing that would prove
that I didn't kill Kevin Lee.

652
00:48:24.608 --> 00:48:26.130
It disappeared.

653
00:48:27.985 --> 00:48:30.599
I'm sure you don't believe me.

654
00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:31.809
The news...

655
00:48:33.389 --> 00:48:35.528
You were great, as you always are.

656
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.108
I apologize for acting like a jerk.

657
00:48:47.108 --> 00:48:48.198
I'm sorry.

658
00:48:49.298 --> 00:48:50.738
This may sounds worse.

659
00:48:51.778 --> 00:48:53.809
I was just angry.

660
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:57.048
The fact that you were mixed up in
this situation with a person like that...

661
00:48:57.048 --> 00:48:58.349
It upset me and made me mad.

662
00:49:06.178 --> 00:49:07.780
From now on, I believe you.

663
00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:12.269
I'm going to believe everything you say.

664
00:49:13.338 --> 00:49:15.099
So, let me help you.

665
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.331
As your husband and as your lawyer.

666
00:49:24.921 --> 00:49:26.079
Now...

667
00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:30.110
will you lean on me, Hye Ran?

668
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:45.276
Oh.

669
00:50:46.264 --> 00:50:47.298
What is this?

670
00:50:50.401 --> 00:50:51.548
Wow.

671
00:50:56.722 --> 00:50:57.974
Take a look at this.

672
00:50:57.974 --> 00:50:59.144
What is it?

673
00:51:00.651 --> 00:51:01.827
Did you find something?

674
00:51:01.827 --> 00:51:03.854
Yes. Look at this.

675
00:51:11.519 --> 00:51:13.432
Seo Eun Joo said she was home.

676
00:51:13.432 --> 00:51:15.459
Yet, she's getting out
of Go Hye Ran's car.

677
00:51:15.459 --> 00:51:16.751
Isn't that strange?

678
00:51:17.889 --> 00:51:22.140
I wasn't feeling well,
so I fell asleep early.

679
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.570
Why would she lie about that?

680
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.871
Shouldn't we look into
Seo Eun Joo, as well?

681
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:32.088
Why would she have met
Go Hye Ran at that time?

682
00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:33.140
What time was it?

683
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.517
It was a bit past 1:00 a.m.

684
00:51:34.517 --> 00:51:36.048
When did Kevin Lee leave?

685
00:51:36.048 --> 00:51:39.528
Kevin Lee returned at...

686
00:51:40.727 --> 00:51:42.338
Oh, here it is.

687
00:51:44.528 --> 00:51:45.537
What time is this?

688
00:51:45.537 --> 00:51:49.586
It's less than 10 minutes after
Go Hye Ran drops Seo Eun Joo off.

689
00:51:49.586 --> 00:51:50.798
Also...

690
00:51:52.448 --> 00:51:55.715
He comes back out about 30 minutes later.

691
00:51:56.677 --> 00:52:00.869
Then he is found dead at 5:00 a.m.

692
00:52:24.689 --> 00:52:25.756
Sit down.

693
00:52:27.285 --> 00:52:29.345
Didn't you hear me?

694
00:52:29.345 --> 00:52:30.595
Sit down.

695
00:52:42.044 --> 00:52:45.693
Did you have fun playing with my husband?

696
00:52:48.713 --> 00:52:52.231
He's not a boring person,
Lee Jae Young.

697
00:52:52.231 --> 00:52:55.642
Having him was probably the fun part.

698
00:52:55.642 --> 00:53:00.072
Money, fame, et cetera.

699
00:53:00.072 --> 00:53:02.242
- Is that it?
- So, how much do you need?

700
00:53:04.861 --> 00:53:08.351
You played well with my husband,
so you should get paid.

701
00:53:13.001 --> 00:53:14.722
Look here, Seo Eun Joo.

702
00:53:14.722 --> 00:53:16.552
You're not thinking...

703
00:53:16.552 --> 00:53:20.311
you're the first girl my husband
cheated with, are you?

704
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.121
You don't look that naive.

705
00:53:25.541 --> 00:53:30.014
I'd rather not hear about how you
were drawn to him, or that you like him.

706
00:53:30.014 --> 00:53:33.390
I know neither of you
is that type of person.

707
00:53:36.032 --> 00:53:37.102
Wow.

708
00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:40.110
You're not what I expected.

709
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:43.671
This is quite the twist.

710
00:53:43.671 --> 00:53:45.720
He has a game in less than a month.

711
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.162
He needs to work out and focus.

712
00:53:48.162 --> 00:53:51.280
That means he no longer
has time to play with you.

713
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.481
So, just tell me how much you need.

714
00:53:57.936 --> 00:54:00.934
Is this how you're going
to get rid of Go Hye Ran too?

715
00:54:02.457 --> 00:54:06.164
Will this work on her?

716
00:54:08.775 --> 00:54:10.735
Did you really not know?

717
00:54:11.825 --> 00:54:13.115
Lee Jae Young.

718
00:54:14.655 --> 00:54:16.794
He was seeing both
Senior Hye Ran and me.

719
00:54:51.146 --> 00:54:53.244
<i>[Eun Joo]</i>

720
00:55:03.525 --> 00:55:04.724
Yes, Eun Joo.

721
00:55:08.617 --> 00:55:09.749
Hello?

722
00:55:10.943 --> 00:55:12.023
<i>Eun Joo.</i>

723
00:55:15.488 --> 00:55:16.608
Hye Ran.

724
00:55:19.189 --> 00:55:20.468
Is it true?

725
00:55:21.939 --> 00:55:23.309
What do you mean?

726
00:55:24.226 --> 00:55:25.302
<i>Did you...</i>

727
00:55:26.267 --> 00:55:28.601
<i>sleep with my husband?</i>

728
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:08.396
Where are you right now?

729
00:57:04.405 --> 00:57:06.356
Just tell me the truth.

730
00:57:09.276 --> 00:57:11.175
- Was it Han Ji Won?
- Answer me.

731
00:57:11.175 --> 00:57:12.267
Is it true?

732
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:21.775
Do I have to ask him to confirm it?

733
00:57:23.517 --> 00:57:25.905
Hm? Hye Ran?

734
00:57:45.742 --> 00:57:46.896
Take a look at this first.

735
00:58:14.912 --> 00:58:18.496
I'm actually being blackmailed
by your husband right now.

736
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:25.293
Recently, pictures of your husband and
Han Ji Won were sent to the station.

737
00:58:26.416 --> 00:58:29.006
They think that I did it.

738
00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:31.736
To put it simply, I didn't do it.

739
00:58:37.117 --> 00:58:38.325
But, why...

740
00:58:38.325 --> 00:58:41.465
He must've wanted
to put me in the same boat.

741
00:58:41.465 --> 00:58:44.376
That's why your husband
created this entire situation.

742
00:58:50.646 --> 00:58:52.921
You're my friend.

743
00:58:52.921 --> 00:58:56.260
I wanted to resolve it without
you finding out, Eun Joo.

744
00:58:58.111 --> 00:59:00.611
This is a sex crime.

745
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:03.780
He forcefully assaulted me.

746
00:59:06.381 --> 00:59:08.534
The day these get exposed to the world...

747
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.599
your husband won't be able
to come back from that.

748
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.582
It's not just your husband.

749
00:59:16.968 --> 00:59:19.086
You and I will both be finished.

750
00:59:59.822 --> 01:00:01.088
Are you all right?

751
01:00:12.215 --> 01:00:13.610
What do I do, Hye Ran?

752
01:00:17.539 --> 01:00:19.108
To tell you the truth...

753
01:00:21.678 --> 01:00:23.017
I'm pregnant.

754
01:00:26.557 --> 01:00:28.193
What do I do?

755
01:00:40.061 --> 01:00:41.497
Go back to the US.

756
01:00:43.157 --> 01:00:44.858
Forget everything here.

757
01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:48.177
Take your husband and go back to the US.

758
01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:51.896
Go and live as if nothing happened.

759
01:00:52.977 --> 01:00:55.322
I'll take care of things here.

760
01:00:56.222 --> 01:00:57.599
Whatever happened today...

761
01:00:58.604 --> 01:01:00.387
You didn't hear a thing.

762
01:01:01.686 --> 01:01:02.947
You didn't see a thing.

763
01:01:03.818 --> 01:01:04.945
Got it?

764
01:01:04.945 --> 01:01:06.590
Oh, Hye Ran!

765
01:01:50.372 --> 01:01:51.510
Honey.

766
01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:53.829
Will you be okay?

767
01:01:57.385 --> 01:01:58.727
Should I go with you?

768
01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:55.209
- Coffee.
- Yeah.

769
01:02:59.981 --> 01:03:02.331
Oh... isn't that Go Hye Ran?

770
01:03:04.492 --> 01:03:05.570
Eun Joo.

771
01:03:09.412 --> 01:03:10.950
Thank you for coming.

772
01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:20.854
It's been hard, right?

773
01:03:23.113 --> 01:03:24.552
I have to get through it.

774
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.881
What will you do?

775
01:03:28.881 --> 01:03:32.720
It's not what I expected,
so I'm taken aback.

776
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.651
<i>No, we were in the same class.</i>

777
01:03:35.651 --> 01:03:40.880
- We just knew each other's names.
- That's right.

778
01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.180
Hye Ran and I were close friends
for all three years.

779
01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:49.561
- Sung Jae.
- Yes, Team Leader.

780
01:03:50.811 --> 01:03:52.541
Suppose they are friends.

781
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:58.421
One says they were very close,
but another says they weren't.

782
01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:00.990
Does that mean they were close or not?

783
01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:04.622
- Doesn't that mean they aren't close?
- Then...

784
01:04:06.401 --> 01:04:11.037
do you think those two
look close or not close?

785
01:04:11.037 --> 01:04:13.664
Thank you so much for coming.

786
01:04:13.664 --> 01:04:15.055
They look close.

787
01:04:15.055 --> 01:04:16.211
Isn't that strange?

788
01:04:16.211 --> 01:04:18.302
It's very strange.

789
01:04:18.302 --> 01:04:21.530
Go Hye Ran is the prime suspect too.

790
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:25.758
Also, she may have been
seeing her husband.

791
01:04:25.758 --> 01:04:26.970
But, look at them.

792
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:29.347
They could be pulling
at each other's hair.

793
01:04:29.347 --> 01:04:32.992
But, look at their friendship.
It is very beautiful

794
01:04:34.198 --> 01:04:35.889
What would you do
if you were Seo Eun Joo?

795
01:04:35.889 --> 01:04:37.624
Would you leave her be?

796
01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.968
- I would just...
- What if...

797
01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:44.037
they were on the same side?

798
01:04:44.037 --> 01:04:45.108
What?

799
01:04:46.787 --> 01:04:51.008
What would happen if those two
women were on the same side?

800
01:04:51.008 --> 01:04:53.258
Then Kevin Lee wouldn't matter.

801
01:04:55.227 --> 01:04:56.957
- Team Leader.
- Sung Jae.

802
01:04:59.278 --> 01:05:01.207
This is very interesting.

803
01:05:03.758 --> 01:05:04.871
Right?

804
01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:08.581
What about the autopsy results?

805
01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.881
They told me results
would be out soon.

806
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:24.626
You're really okay, right?

807
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.731
I'll have to be okay.

808
01:05:38.849 --> 01:05:41.405
<i>Are you confident?</i>

809
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.231
If you don't have the confidence
to handle this situation

810
01:05:48.231 --> 01:05:50.021
cut ties now and give up.

811
01:05:51.662 --> 01:05:53.164
No, I will do it.

812
01:05:54.561 --> 01:05:57.671
I will protect Hye Ran.

813
01:05:58.773 --> 01:06:00.948
It will become a dirty fight.

814
01:06:00.948 --> 01:06:02.106
I know.

815
01:06:02.106 --> 01:06:04.372
The truth is not important.

816
01:06:04.372 --> 01:06:07.412
Who makes their version
look more like the truth?

817
01:06:07.412 --> 01:06:09.224
That battle will win the fight.

818
01:06:11.564 --> 01:06:12.999
I know that.

819
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:33.992
Sung Jae, this won't do.

820
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:36.713
We need a new game plan
for Lee Jae Young's case.

821
01:06:38.872 --> 01:06:40.577
What? Again?

822
01:06:40.577 --> 01:06:42.760
Gosh, Team Leader!

823

830
01:08:55.469 --> 01:08:57.794

01:08:57.794 --> 01:08:59.538
<i>When I said I would protect you</i>

832

you have and everything you want.</i>

<i>I'm going to do everything
I promised, no matter what.</i>

834

<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

835
01:09:11.036 --> 01:09:13.163
<i>I want to bury this.</i>

836
01:09:13.163 --> 01:09:14.738
<i>Can you do it?</i>

837
01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:18.330
<i>Who is trying to screw
with me to this degree?</i>

838
01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:20.491
<i>I will never let
that person get away with it.</i>
