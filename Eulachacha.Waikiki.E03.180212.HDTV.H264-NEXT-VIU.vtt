1
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.470
We are the world

2
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.810
We are the world

3
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.810
Firstly, I would love to say thank you to everyone...

4
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.150
for staying at Waikiki Guesthouse.

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.749
I really hope you have a great trip...

6
00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.549
with Waikiki Guesthouse.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.920
It's your turn.

8
00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.189
- Ladies and gentlemen! - Everyone,

9
00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.420
Thank you.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.920
Okay.

11
00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:35.160
Is that all?

12
00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:36.490
My speech was a lot longer than that.

13
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.599
Mine is just condensed.

14
00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:38.929
They just need to get the point.

15
00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.160
Forget it.

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.469
What would I expect from you?

17
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.599
Alright, let's have some fun today!

18
00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:46.069
Cheers!

19
00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:47.510
- Cheers! - Cheers!

20
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.149
What's wrong with him?

21
00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.649
He got dumped recently.

22
00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.880
(Finally, I can be honest about how I feel.)

23
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.950
(I was always thinking ahead.)

24
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.260
You don't have to worry about him. Here we go...

25
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.790
Cheers!

26
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.960
- Cheers! - Cheers!

27
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:11.560
What's wrong with her?

28
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.900
She also got dumped a few days ago.

29
00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.670
It was really brutal. It couldn't get worse than that.

30
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.170
Don't worry about them. Here we go again!

31
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.040
- Cheers! - Cheers!

32
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.379
Well, I don't feel like it anymore. I'll go back to my room and rest.

33
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:25.909
Why? I thought we are having fun.

34
00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.010
Where are you going? Wait!

35
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.249
- Excuse me? - Wait!

36
00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.579
- Stop it! - Don't go!

37
00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.579
Mayday! Mayday!

38
00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.650
- Please wait! - This is emergency!

39
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.790
Goodness!

40
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.960
You guys!

41
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960
Stop blowing your nose,

42
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.829
or your brains will come out.

43
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.060
For how long will you be like this?

44
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.999
Don't you see our guests feeling uncomfortable because of you two?

45
00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.639
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.499
I just can't get over Tae Hyun.

47
00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.710
I can't stop crying.

48
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.139
- What are you talking about? - What are you talking about?

49
00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.379
Don't cry, Seo Jin.

50
00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.350
Seo Jin!

51
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.290
- Oh, my goodness. - Are you Jean Valjean or what?

52
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.269
Tae Hyun, what are you doing here?

53
00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.399
I wanted to see you.

54
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.769
I wanted to see you so much.

55
00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:26.799
Weren't you disappointed in me?

56
00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.269
Why would I be disappointed in you?

57
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.170
Is it because of your facial hair?

58
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.179
That's so stupid! What's so wrong with it?

59
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.350
Are you a fool?

60
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.119
Even if you grow bananas from the top of your head...

61
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.920
Even if you grow...

62
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.649
kelp and seaweed from your armpits...

63
00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:44.720
He's insane.

64
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.519
I don't care, Seo Jin.

65
00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.630
Tae Hyun.

66
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.000
Do you want to officially become my girlfriend?

67
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.630
Tae Hyun!

68
00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.600
Kelp or seaweed...

69
00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.500
It doesn't matter.

70
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.369
Do they think they are in a movie or something?

71
00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.709
It's like such an ugly and awful...

72
00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.480
third-rate cult film.

73
00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.109
Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

74
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.179
I'm so jealous.

75
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.720
Alright...

76
00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.459
("A Beautiful Farewell")

77
00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.559
- Let's go. - Let's do this!

78
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.630
- That's it! - Yes!

79
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.700
- We did it! - Yes!

80
00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.750
- Tae Hyun, here's your coffee. - Thank you.

81
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.489
Tae Hyun, you are bleeding.

82
00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.260
It's okay. I get nosebleeds often.

83
00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.839
They are such nice paintings.

84
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.679
We are already here. It's pretty late. You should go in now.

85
00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:15.750
Okay.

86
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.189
Oh, I almost forgot about this.

87
00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.129
- Here you are. - What is this?

88
00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.770
You have to open this in your room.

89
00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:36.699
I'll go now.

90
00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.040
- Take care! - I will.

91
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.259
I love you.

92
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.359
I'm home.

93
00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.059
You are home! How was the date?

94
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.400
Chewbacca, why are you blushing so much right now?

95
00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.340
It's like you just had a kiss or something.

96
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.400
It's not like that.

97
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.340
What do you mean? It's so obvious!

98
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.210
- What is that? - This?

99
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.609
It's a gift from Tae Hyun.

100
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:18.640
Gift?

101
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.809
Let's open it!

102
00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:21.780
Why do you want to do that? It's mine!

103
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.009
Because I'm your older brother!

104
00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:24.850
Why can't I see it?

105
00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.350
It's quite nice.

106
00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.359
What? What is this?

107
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.699
It's a razor!

108
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.400
Well, that's...

109
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.100
That's something I've never seen before.

110
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.340
I've never seen a woman...

111
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.170
who gets a razor from her boyfriend.

112
00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:51.379
- Stop talking. - Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

113
00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:54.109
What's your problem now?

114
00:05:54.109 --> 00:05:55.650
Come to think of it,

115
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.650
I don't think I ever gave Soo Ah a proper gift.

116
00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:10.499
What is this smell?

117
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.460
It's gimbap!

118
00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.069
What do you think you are doing? It's for Tae Hyun!

119
00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.100
That's so annoying! I'm not going to have it!

120
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.340
Don't eat it.

121
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.869
You've never cooked a bag of ramyeon for us before.

122
00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:24.309
But look what you are doing to your boyfriend now.

123
00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.710
How stingy.

124
00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:28.580
Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

125
00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:31.650
What now?

126
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.720
I never made gimbap for Soo Ah.

127
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.259
There are not many guys who make...

128
00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:39.619
gimbap for their girlfriends in Korea.

129
00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.330
Don't you agree, Du Shik?

130
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.330
Don't you need to ask me...

131
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.400
if I ever had a girlfriend first?

132
00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:50.499
- I'm sorry. - You are so mean!

133
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.299
Seo Jin, why are you just standing there?

134
00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:27.869
There's no reason. You have a nosebleed.

135
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:30.580
I'm just stressed out a lot because of my work.

136
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.239
So it's happening more often these days.

137
00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:33.340
I see.

138
00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:38.580
I'm almost done with this article. Just wait for a bit.

139
00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.520
I will. Take your time.

140
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.189
I need to study too.

141
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.470
Nowadays...

142
00:07:58.239 --> 00:07:59.569
It is...

143
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.569
I'm done.

144
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.009
What is that?

145
00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.150
It's gimbap.

146
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.679
Did you make that for me?

147
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.780
Yes, I did.

148
00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:11.420
Please try it.

149
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.679
That looks delicious.

150
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.090
Seo Jin, gimbap tastes best when you eat it with your hands.

151
00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:22.660
This looks amazing.

152
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.999
This is so delicious.

153
00:08:28.929 --> 00:08:30.540
You should try one too.

154
00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:35.670
It's okay. I can feed myself.

155
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.280
Seo Jin, I want to feed you.

156
00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:40.510
Please try this.

157
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.079
Here we go!

158
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.549
Look at you!

159
00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:46.020
You are cute.

160
00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:48.219
Goodness! What is that?

161
00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:52.790
What do you mean? I couldn't see anything.

162
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.990
I guess there was nothing.

163
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.729
Look how cute you are!

164
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.360
You're so cute and mischievous.

165
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.270
Seo Jin, you know one isn't enough.

166
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.770
Here you go. Open up.

167
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.110
- It's okay. I'm fine. - Open up.

168
00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:18.179
Can you watch something else?

169
00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:19.819
Please let me watch this.

170
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:22.319
It's new every time I watch it.

171
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.329
There are no tissues left.

172
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.729
Don't touch the remote control.

173
00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:36.299
Gosh.

174
00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:37.599
I'm back.

175
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.500
Chewbacca, you're back.

176
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.209
How was your date?

177
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.439
It was all right.

178
00:09:42.439 --> 00:09:44.079
Then why do you look so depressed?

179
00:09:44.079 --> 00:09:46.479
- Did you have a fight? - No.

180
00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:49.110
Tae Hyun seems to have a weird habit.

181
00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:51.979
- Like what? - He picks his nose a lot.

182
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:55.319
Everyone does that from time to time. It's no big deal.

183
00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:56.790
It's more serious than that.

184
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.860
After picking his nose, he ate food with his hand,

185
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.829
fed me, and pinched my cheek.

186
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:02.890
Chewbacca.

187
00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:05.099
You're so selfish.

188
00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:06.199
Why?

189
00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:08.530
Tae Hyun said he was okay with your facial hair,

190
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.069
but you can't stand him picking his nose?

191
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:11.439
They're not the same.

192
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.469
I was born this way. His is a habit.

193
00:10:13.469 --> 00:10:16.010
Whatever. If it bothers you so much, talk to him.

194
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.240
Will it be okay? What if he gets angry?

195
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.579
If he can accept that you have facial hair, I'm sure he'll be fine.

196
00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:21.979
This is my seat.

197
00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:27.120
What is it now? Tell us.

198
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.520
We're out of toilet paper.

199
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.089
Oh, my head hurts.

200
00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.260
- My goodness. - Dong Gu.

201
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.530
I made some porridge. Have some.

202
00:10:36.189 --> 00:10:37.429
I don't feel like eating.

203
00:10:37.729 --> 00:10:39.329
How long are you going to be like this?

204
00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:41.900
You're not eating or sleeping. You might die.

205
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.729
Leave me alone to die.

206
00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:45.799
I don't want to live any longer.

207
00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:48.170
You're crazy.

208
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.880
Why would you risk your life for just a girl like Soo Ah?

209
00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:54.110
What?

210
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.179
Just a girl like Soo Ah?

211
00:10:57.479 --> 00:10:58.750
Are you done?

212
00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:00.179
What?

213
00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:02.449
Soo Ah might be nothing to you,

214
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:04.689
but I loved her truly.

215
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.890
To me, Soo Ah is a memory I'll never forget...

216
00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:11.059
and a wound that will never heal, okay?

217
00:11:15.099 --> 00:11:17.699
Why is he taking it out on me? Hey!

218
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.229
What are you doing here alone?

219
00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:50.770
Nothing.

220
00:11:57.479 --> 00:11:58.839
It must be hard for you.

221
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.380
A sudden breakup is painful.

222
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.120
I've been there too.

223
00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:08.490
Dong Gu.

224
00:12:08.849 --> 00:12:10.920
No matter how painful it is now,

225
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.660
you can overcome anything with time.

226
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.829
- So... - No.

227
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.530
I don't think so.

228
00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:20.870
I'll never be over Soo Ah even in a hundred years.

229
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.530
Why?

230
00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:24.400
I couldn't do much for her.

231
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.370
I regret it so much.

232
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.640
Do you know what I regret the most?

233
00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:37.750
Even our last moment together wasn't beautiful.

234
00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:41.589
I wish I could meet her just once more...

235
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.020
and say goodbye to her...

236
00:12:48.329 --> 00:12:50.429
in a beautiful way.

237
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.979
What brings you here?

238
00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:15.620
I have a favor to ask you.

239
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.020
What is it?

240
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.490
- Can you meet Dong Gu just once? - Why should I?

241
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.660
He's suffering a lot.

242
00:13:22.929 --> 00:13:25.429
He's not eating or sleeping. He cries all day.

243
00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:27.030
What does that have to do with me?

244
00:13:27.429 --> 00:13:29.599
You were together for four years.

245
00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:32.640
You shouldn't break up like this.

246
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.740
- Why don't you meet him and... - In any case,

247
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.610
I don't want to meet him. Please go back.

248
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.179
I have to work.

249
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.979
It'll mean a lot to him. Please meet him just once.

250
00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:46.449
Soo Ah.

251
00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:50.390
Please.

252
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.990
Soo Ah.

253
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.929
Soo Ah. Just this once.

254
00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:58.160
I don't care. Go back now.

255
00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:00.260
Soo Ah!

256
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.370
Soo Ah, please meet him once.

257
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.969
Soo Ah!

258
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.179
Why are you staring at me? Do I have something on my face?

259
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.589
No. It's nothing.

260
00:14:22.689 --> 00:14:24.589
I'm almost done here. Give me just a second.

261
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.490
Okay.

262
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.089
(Nose)

263
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.069
(Nose)

264
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.339
(Nose)

265
00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:45.179
(Nose)

266
00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:51.349
- Tae Hyun. - Gosh, what is it?

267
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.650
I'm sorry to say this,

268
00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:55.449
but can you stop picking your nose?

269
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.319
Sorry. I didn't realize.

270
00:15:01.089 --> 00:15:02.290
Please don't.

271
00:15:03.429 --> 00:15:04.559
Don't.

272
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.099
Stop rolling and flicking your booger too.

273
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.740
Okay. I'm sorry.

274
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.439
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this,

275
00:15:17.439 --> 00:15:19.979
- but I think I have to. - Okay.

276
00:15:19.979 --> 00:15:22.079
You pick your nose just too much. Do you know that?

277
00:15:22.209 --> 00:15:23.349
Really? Me?

278
00:15:23.349 --> 00:15:26.920
Yes. You said your nose often bleeds for no reason.

279
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.490
You're wrong.

280
00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:31.120
Your nose bleeds because you pick your nose too often.

281
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.760
It must be a habit I wasn't aware of. I'm so sorry.

282
00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:39.059
It's okay. You can always break a habit.

283
00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:43.270
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

284
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.740
You didn't.

285
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.969
You were just concerned about me. Why would it hurt my feelings?

286
00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:48.540
That's a relief.

287
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.110
Let's grab a beer somewhere.

288
00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:53.410
- Let's go. - Okay.

289
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.520
Dong Gu, over here.

290
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.260
What is it? Why did you want to see me here?

291
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.360
There's this girl I met while working at the convenience store.

292
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.599
She's been asking me to set her up with someone.

293
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.229
- And? - What do you think?

294
00:16:12.229 --> 00:16:13.360
I'm setting her up with you.

295
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.670
A new girl will help you get over your ex-girlfriend.

296
00:16:15.729 --> 00:16:17.000
- So... - Are you out of your mind?

297
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
- What's wrong? - Can't you take me more seriously?

298
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.309
Thinking of Soo Ah still makes my heart ache.

299
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:24.780
I'm not ready to get over Soo Ah,

300
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.410
and I don't want to. Do you get it?

301
00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:28.780
Don't leave like this.

302
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.250
- Just say hi. - You're out of your mind.

303
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.420
Here she comes.

304
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.880
- Min Ah! - What?

305
00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:44.059
Min Ah, this is my friend, Kang Dong Gu.

306
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.299
Hi.

307
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.030
I'm Lee Min Ah.

308
00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.299
Hi.

309
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.299
I'm saying hi to her for your sake.

310
00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:52.670
Don't do this again, okay?

311
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:54.309
Okay.

312
00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:57.740
I've heard a lot about you.

313
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.979
I see.

314
00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:01.410
Okay.

315
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:04.049
Should we go grab a coffee somewhere?

316
00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:06.449
Why don't we have a drink instead?

317
00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:07.850
- That sounds great. - Min Ah.

318
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.620
Dong Gu has to go.

319
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.090
He broke up with a girl recently.

320
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.529
He's not ready for a date yet.

321
00:17:15.929 --> 00:17:17.860
I see.

322
00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:20.699
Don't worry. It's no problem.

323
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.769
Dong Gu, I'm sorry I didn't know how you were feeling.

324
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:27.469
Go home, and get some rest.

325
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.269
Get a lot of rest.

326
00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:30.580
Okay.

327
00:17:30.979 --> 00:17:32.509
It was nice meeting you.

328
00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:33.709
See you again.

329
00:17:34.949 --> 00:17:37.150
Du Shik, buy me grilled clams, okay?

330
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.249
Okay.

331
00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:40.219
How have you been? We haven't talked in a while.

332
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.459
Dong Gu.

333
00:17:45.719 --> 00:17:47.130
Why are you looking back?

334
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.390
Are you disappointed?

335
00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:50.429
You broke up with Soo Ah only recently.

336
00:17:50.999 --> 00:17:52.160
Pull yourself together.

337
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.870
It tastes good.

338
00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.900
What food should we order?

339
00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:02.039
Perilla leaves...

340
00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.479
Tae Hyun, there you go again.

341
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.249
- I'm sorry. - I must do something.

342
00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:13.679
I think we need a special measure.

343
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.390
A special measure?

344
00:18:20.189 --> 00:18:23.289
Seo Jin, is this really necessary?

345
00:18:23.289 --> 00:18:25.560
It's necessary so you can break your habit.

346
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.959
You don't like it?

347
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.969
It's okay. All right.

348
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.229
Cheers.

349
00:18:30.969 --> 00:18:32.070
Hold on.

350
00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:35.239
- Cheers. - Cheers.

351
00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:41.350
Cheers.

352
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.519
Go ahead.

353
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:50.959
Sorry.

354
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.660
Dong Gu.

355
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.259
Oh, it's you.

356
00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.630
Yes. Min Ah wanted grilled clams.

357
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:57.860
What are you doing here?

358
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.699
I wanted to drink some soju and sort my thoughts.

359
00:19:01.699 --> 00:19:02.870
- By yourself? - Yes.

360
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.439
- At a grilled clam place? - Yes. What?

361
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.570
I come here alone a couple of times a week. Is that strange?

362
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.969
Would you like to join us?

363
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.110
- Sure. - No.

364
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.650
Dong Gu wants to sort his thoughts alone.

365
00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:16.910
He's been suffering a lot lately.

366
00:19:17.979 --> 00:19:21.050
Dong Gu, forget about us and eat a lot.

367
00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:23.120
Eat as much as you want.

368
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.219
I will.

369
00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:27.429
I'm leaving.

370
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.259
- Here you go. - Thanks.

371
00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:34.429
What would you like?

372
00:19:34.429 --> 00:19:36.529
I'd like a bottle of soju with grilled clams.

373
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:38.269
By yourself? It'll be a lot.

374
00:19:38.269 --> 00:19:40.640
I always eat it 2 to 3 times a week.

375
00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:41.739
I'll take it.

376
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.550
Gosh, this is so much.

377
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.709
The amount is endless.

378
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.979
I'll pour you some.

379
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.650
- Cheers. - Cheers.

380
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.590
Isn't he so tactless?

381
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.959
How can anyone be so tactless like him?

382
00:20:02.959 --> 00:20:05.830
- Who is he? - He's Lee Jun Ki, my housemate.

383
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.300
He must be born with that personality.

384
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.439
How could he be so tactless?

385
00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:13.039
- Let's drink the last shot. - Okay.

386
00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:17.239
That was a good meal.

387
00:20:17.239 --> 00:20:19.509
- Shall we go now? - Shall we?

388
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.850
Are you leaving too?

389
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.679
I was about to leave.

390
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.320
You have a lot of clams left.

391
00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:30.150
I'll pack them to go for Sol.

392
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.890
You'll give grilled clams to Sol?

393
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.320
She just turned 100 days old.

394
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.729
I'll blend them for her.

395
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.100
Ma'am, may I pack these?

396
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.679
Tae Hyun, you're doing it again.

397
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.779
You do it whenever I'm not around.

398
00:20:59.749 --> 00:21:01.749
Seo Jin, isn't this too harsh?

399
00:21:01.749 --> 00:21:03.590
What do you mean?

400
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.060
I'll hit you every time you pick your nose.

401
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.029
I understand, so let's stop it.

402
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.860
Stop what?

403
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.199
Isn't what I say important to you?

404
00:21:13.199 --> 00:21:14.769
Why don't you listen to me?

405
00:21:14.769 --> 00:21:16.670
Please stop.

406
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.039
Why are you getting upset?

407
00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:19.840
Is it such a huge sin to pick my nose?

408
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.009
I'm doing this for you.

409
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.039
Your nose bleeds often, and it's not hygienic.

410
00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:26.179
Honestly,

411
00:21:27.209 --> 00:21:29.150
it doesn't look good either.

412
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.219
"It doesn't look good"?

413
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.949
You have facial hair.

414
00:21:37.189 --> 00:21:39.219
Why are you bringing that up?

415
00:21:39.219 --> 00:21:40.959
I was understanding about your facial hair.

416
00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:42.130
Why can't you accept what I do?

417
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.590
How are they the same?

418
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.300
I was born with it, but this is your habit.

419
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.900
I was born with the tendency to have a lot of boogers.

420
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.969
What did you say?

421
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.100
Be honest.

422
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.969
Which is worse? Your facial hair or me picking my nose?

423
00:21:54.509 --> 00:21:56.670
Do you want to know? Shall I ask around?

424
00:21:57.279 --> 00:21:58.279
Excuse me.

425
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.949
This woman has facial hair like a man.

426
00:22:01.979 --> 00:22:04.320
Which is worse, picking one's nose or facial hair?

427
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:06.749
What's wrong with you? You're embarrassing me.

428
00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:09.590
Embarrassing? Are you embarrassed of me?

429
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.420
I'm embarrassed of you too. Do you know why?

430
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.630
When I'm on a date with you all day long,

431
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.429
your facial hair starts to grow. I can see it.

432
00:22:20.199 --> 00:22:22.670
When I kiss you,

433
00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:25.400
it stings.

434
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.140
I apply ointment every time I go home after kissing you.

435
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.479
The thought of myself...

436
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.479
I put up with it.

437
00:22:32.479 --> 00:22:34.580
Why do you make me a pathetic person...

438
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.709
for picking my nose? Why?

439
00:22:36.709 --> 00:22:38.650
Why didn't you tell me before?

440
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.320
How did you put up with it?

441
00:22:40.719 --> 00:22:41.989
You're so narrow-minded.

442
00:22:41.989 --> 00:22:43.189
"Narrow-minded"?

443
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.420
Are you done talking?

444
00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:47.830
Yes, I called you narrow-minded.

445
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.989
A man shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

446
00:22:49.989 --> 00:22:51.459
You're right. I'm narrow-minded.

447
00:22:51.459 --> 00:22:52.499
So what? You're hairy.

448
00:22:52.499 --> 00:22:53.900
Hairy?

449
00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:55.999
You're a booger.

450
00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:57.999
- "A booger"? - Yes, you're a booger.

451
00:22:57.999 --> 00:22:59.340
Don't call me that.

452
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.400
You're the Wolfman of Huam-dong.

453
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.070
"The Wolfman of Huam-dong"?

454
00:23:02.969 --> 00:23:05.009
- You're the Booger of Wangshimni. - Wangshimni?

455
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.439
Don't look down on Wangshimni.

456
00:23:06.439 --> 00:23:08.679
I can't tolerate that. Let's break up.

457
00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:10.009
Let's break up.

458
00:23:10.009 --> 00:23:11.449
Don't call me again, Booger.

459
00:23:11.449 --> 00:23:13.449
You better not call me, Wolfman of Huam-dong.

460
00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:14.850
I can't hear you, Booger.

461
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.689
- Booger, I can't hear you. - Wolfman.

462
00:23:16.689 --> 00:23:17.989
- Wolfman. - I can't hear you.

463
00:23:17.989 --> 00:23:20.060
Please calm down.

464
00:23:22.689 --> 00:23:23.689
You startled me.

465
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:25.759
Haven't you left?

466
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.600
Please see Dong Gu one last time, please?

467
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.239
What's wrong with you?

468
00:23:31.239 --> 00:23:32.600
Did Dong Gu make you do it?

469
00:23:32.769 --> 00:23:35.410
- No. - Then why are you doing this?

470
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.070
I know how it feels...

471
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.509
not to say goodbye properly to someone you love.

472
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.910
I know it better than anyone else.

473
00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:45.550
Please see him one last time.

474
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.719
I beg you.

475
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.689
No.

476
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:53.560
I don't want to see Dong Gu ever again.

477
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.289
Stop wasting your time, and leave.

478
00:23:57.429 --> 00:23:59.300
You're being too harsh.

479
00:24:00.499 --> 00:24:01.529
Soo Ah.

480
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.739
If you continue, I won't tolerate it.

481
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.439
What?

482
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.009
What will you do if you won't tolerate it?

483
00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:16.249
- Darn it. - Gosh.

484
00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:17.779
My bag.

485
00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:21.850
What's wrong with her? Wait.

486
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.759
Thank you for dinner tonight.

487
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.890
You're welcome.

488
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.029
Don't forget your blind date on Friday.

489
00:24:29.189 --> 00:24:30.999
- What, a blind date? - Okay.

490
00:24:31.229 --> 00:24:33.060
Is he introducing her to someone else?

491
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.499
I haven't gotten her number yet. He's so disloyal.

492
00:24:35.499 --> 00:24:36.900
Hold on.

493
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.039
Why do I need her phone number?

494
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.910
Are you really interested in her?

495
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:44.479
Wake up. Come back to senses, Dong Gu.

496
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.380
Haven't you left yet?

497
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.489
What's wrong?

498
00:24:54.489 --> 00:24:56.620
Something got stuck in my teeth.

499
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.060
Min Ah, do you have a business card?

500
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.189
Why do you need it?

501
00:24:59.189 --> 00:25:02.060
Business cards are perfect for picking your teeth.

502
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.390
When I have something...

503
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.459
stuck in my teeth, I get a seizure. Didn't you know?

504
00:25:05.459 --> 00:25:06.560
- I didn't. - I see.

505
00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:08.400
Do you have a business card, Min Ah?

506
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.400
I have one.

507
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.800
Here you go.

508
00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:15.739
It's a precious business card that Pig Mother gave you.

509
00:25:15.739 --> 00:25:17.239
How can I use it?

510
00:25:17.239 --> 00:25:19.209
That's true. Wait, I might have another one.

511
00:25:19.209 --> 00:25:20.380
Do you have one?

512
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.249
A business card? Wait.

513
00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:23.580
I don't have...

514
00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:28.320
I have one from my old company.

515
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320
Is it okay?

516
00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:31.759
This is the right angle.

517
00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:34.160
It's my favorite angle.

518
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.729
It's perfect for picking teeth.

519
00:25:36.729 --> 00:25:38.729
It's difficult to find it.

520
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.870
I'm glad to hear that.

521
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.199
Have a good night.

522
00:25:43.969 --> 00:25:45.600
This is great.

523
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.840
What's wrong with him?

524
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.939
That was smooth.

525
00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.050
It was brilliant. Awesome.

526
00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:00.989
Yoon Ah, please stop.

527
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.320
If you promise to meet Dong Gu.

528
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.719
Goodness.

529
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.060
Give back my bag.

530
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.900
I won't let it go unless you promise to meet Dong Gu.

531
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.029
What's wrong with you?

532
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:20.340
You shouldn't do this to someone you once loved.

533
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.969
Please meet him just once.

534
00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:25.140
Okay, I will.

535
00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:26.580
Really?

536
00:26:26.739 --> 00:26:27.749
Where's Dong Gu now?

537
00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:29.249
He probably be in the guesthouse.

538
00:26:30.449 --> 00:26:31.449
Let's go.

539
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.590
It's Dong Gu. We met on a blind date today.

540
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.459
I just called to see if you went home safely.

541
00:26:41.929 --> 00:26:43.900
It was good to meet you today.

542
00:26:46.699 --> 00:26:47.729
Soo Ah.

543
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:51.100
Did you go on a blind date?

544
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:53.600
No, but why are you here?

545
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.840
You said that your last wish is to see her one more time.

546
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.009
That's true but...

547
00:26:58.009 --> 00:26:59.709
Soo Ah, let me explain.

548
00:26:59.709 --> 00:27:02.209
Dong Gu, let's talk.

549
00:27:02.209 --> 00:27:03.279
What?

550
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.120
Okay, sure.

551
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.900
You misunderstood, Soo Ah.

552
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.830
I wasn't thinking about going on a blind date,

553
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.969
but Du Shik told me to come out.

554
00:27:23.969 --> 00:27:25.600
I must have lost my mind.

555
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.870
I'm really sorry.

556
00:27:30.009 --> 00:27:31.009
Dong Gu.

557
00:27:32.739 --> 00:27:34.779
You don't have to apologize.

558
00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:37.949
I don't deserve your apologies either.

559
00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:40.949
During the last four years,

560
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.590
thank you so much for liking me.

561
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.289
I was happy.

562
00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:47.529
- However... - Stop it.

563
00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:51.029
What are you trying to say?

564
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:52.300
You should get angry instead.

565
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.100
If you do this, I can't hang onto you.

566
00:27:56.699 --> 00:27:58.140
It seems like it's really over.

567
00:28:01.939 --> 00:28:04.539
Soo Ah, I'll treat you better.

568
00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:06.739
I'll treat you 1,000 times better than that jerk.

569
00:28:06.739 --> 00:28:08.550
- Soo Ah, please... - Dong Gu.

570
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.880
You already treated me well enough.

571
00:28:11.979 --> 00:28:13.850
What happened wasn't your fault.

572
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.850
It was all my fault.

573
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.560
I changed.

574
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.590
You know what?

575
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.300
I'm so happy to be with Yoon Seok.

576
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.400
So please forget about me.

577
00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.070
I hope you'll be happy too.

578
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.370
I'm sorry.

579
00:28:38.179 --> 00:28:39.340
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

580
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.310
I'm really sorry.

581
00:28:49.189 --> 00:28:51.160
Thank you so much...

582
00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:53.719
for liking me.

583
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:01.969
I'll be going now.

584

585
00:29:47.449 --> 00:29:49.110
You always live thinking about tomorrow.

586
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:53.350
Those who live for tomorrow will be killed by the one living for today.

587
00:29:54.019 --> 00:29:55.420
I live only for today.

588
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.390
You have no idea how messed up that is.

589
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:03.060
I will show you now.

590
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:09.469
Please leave your profile there and leave.

591
00:30:09.729 --> 00:30:10.800
Yes, sir.

592
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.739
It was Lee Jun Ki, the new actor!

593
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.279
Please don't forget me.

594
00:30:25.179 --> 00:30:27.350
I hope you to make a film that gets 10 million viewers!

595
00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:38.300
("Are You Still Dreaming?")

596
00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:40.199
- See you again. - Bye.

597
00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:41.300
See you again.

598
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.429
- Bye. - Bye.

599
00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:44.170
I'm home.

600
00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:46.170
You suit up. Where did you go like that this morning?

601
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.110
I visited every film production with my profile as a work out.

602
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.380
Does that do anything?

603
00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.310
You are always in the background with no lines anyway.

604
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.880
You are wasting paper.

605
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.310
- It's a waste. - What did you say?

606
00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:59.050
How can you say that to someone who worked so hard in the morning?

607
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.519
That's why your first love called you the Wolfman of Huam-dong.

608
00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:06.560
I told you not to say that.

609
00:31:06.689 --> 00:31:08.890
- Stop it. Stop it! - What are you doing?

610
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.830
- I told you to stop! - Guests are here. Don't fight.

611
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.429
- Kang Seo Jin! - Let go, you brat!

612
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.670
What is that camera?

613
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.769
What is that for?

614
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:18.769
- I'm filming tomorrow. - Filming?

615
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.039
- What filming? - I'm helping Tae Shik out.

616
00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:23.239
Why do you need an extra job?

617
00:31:23.439 --> 00:31:24.610
It's for money.

618
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.610
Money? Did anything happen to you?

619
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.880
What? Nothing happened.

620
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.179
I'm done with Soo Ah.

621
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.920
It looks like Soo Ah has someone better anyway.

622
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.660
I should let her go.

623
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:45.759
What does that have to do with making money though?

624
00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:49.229
After breaking up with her, I realize all I have left is films.

625
00:31:49.729 --> 00:31:51.969
I think I'll just focus on films more from this year.

626
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.179
I'm going to film our movie this year with enough budget.

627
00:31:57.179 --> 00:31:59.410
Jun Ki, practice your acting.

628
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.880
And Du Shik, don't be lazy with your scenario.

629
00:32:02.949 --> 00:32:05.979
That's my Dong Gu! You are strong-willed again!

630
00:32:07.189 --> 00:32:09.219
Are you going to write everything like you told me though?

631
00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:11.289
The one with the president's son reincarnated?

632
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.729
I wonder how many days they can keep up with that.

633
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.009
Why are you sighing?

634
00:32:29.939 --> 00:32:31.810
What's going on?

635
00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:33.880
Seo Jin,

636
00:32:34.449 --> 00:32:35.810
do you have a dream too?

637
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.249
A dream? Yes, I do.

638
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.019
I want to be a journalist.

639
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.949
That has been my dream since I was a kid.

640
00:32:42.189 --> 00:32:45.219
But now I can't remember how many times I failed at it.

641
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.590
Why are you asking me that?

642
00:32:48.189 --> 00:32:49.390
Because I'm envious of it.

643
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.029
Everyone has a dream.

644
00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:53.330
Dong Gu does, and Jun Ki does too.

645
00:32:53.769 --> 00:32:54.900
Du Shik and you also have dreams.

646
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.229
How can you be envious of that?

647
00:32:56.529 --> 00:32:57.870
Do you not have any dream?

648
00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.910
I used to have it, but I can't have one in my situation.

649
00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.739
What does your situation have to do with your dream?

650
00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:04.410
You know what I'm going through.

651
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.709
I have Sol too.

652
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.410
Yoon Ah, do you know about J. K. Rowling?

653
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.749
She was also a divorcee with a child.

654
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.550
Her only income was 15 dollars a week from the government.

655
00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:18.160
She even ran out of formula, so she had to water it down.

656
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.229
Do you know what book she wrote going through all that?

657
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.999
It's the Harry Potter series.

658
00:33:25.499 --> 00:33:27.870
Having a lack of time, being in a bad situation,

659
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.800
and having poor parents...

660
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.600
Those are just excuses.

661
00:33:32.199 --> 00:33:34.509
So tell me. What is your dream?

662
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.580
I will help you out. So just tell me.

663
00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:41.779
I want to be a rapper.

664
00:33:42.209 --> 00:33:43.509
A rapper?

665
00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:47.080
Like Dok2 and B.I?

666
00:33:47.249 --> 00:33:48.989
Why? Is that weird?

667
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.959
I don't think it's weird. It's just not what I expected.

668
00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:53.459
Are you good at rapping though?

669
00:33:53.459 --> 00:33:54.789
I can do it a little bit.

670
00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.630
- Do you want me to show you? - Okay.

671
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:05.939
Yes, get it

672
00:34:05.939 --> 00:34:08.809
The world in front of me it is a fantasy

673
00:34:08.809 --> 00:34:09.869
It's a nice meal

674
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:11.880
The best of it is the Prime Minister's Award

675
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.050
Or is it a Presidential Award? Is that true?

676
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.280
You are lingerie, Misari, and the third wheel

677
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.749
You are Misery!

678
00:34:23.689 --> 00:34:24.789
what do you think?

679
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.920
That's very unique.

680
00:34:27.189 --> 00:34:29.689
I think you'll get better if you practice a bit more.

681
00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:32.930
Do you really think so? Do you think I should go for this?

682
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.200
Of course! Why not?

683
00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:37.030
That's your dream.

684
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.240
Thank you, Seo Jin.

685
00:34:38.499 --> 00:34:41.570
If it wasn't you, I would've only thought about it instead of trying.

686
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.939
- I can't thank you enough. - Don't worry about it.

687
00:34:44.579 --> 00:34:45.709
Cheer up.

688
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.979
Private Kim, wake up. You can't die like this.

689
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.650
Let's go back home alive.

690
00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:56.119
Mayday! Mayday!

691
00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:58.360
It's an emergency.

692
00:34:59.019 --> 00:35:02.630
Private Kim, we are almost there. Hang in there!

693
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.860
Private Kim!

694
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:08.970
You jerks.

695
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.939
I will see you again in the afterlife.

696
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.380
- This is what I've prepared! - Well, you are...

697
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.889
aware of what kind of movie you are auditioning for, right?

698
00:35:28.889 --> 00:35:29.990
Of course, sir!

699
00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.920
It's called "Marine". Isn't it about special operations marine?

700
00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.329
No, it's not. Our film is about a swimmer.

701
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:36.630
It's about Marine Boy, Park Tae Hwan.

702
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.300
It's about swimming, the Olympics, and youth!

703
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.530
I'm sorry, sir.

704
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.400
I've been auditioning for so many films these days.

705
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.030
Please let me try once more.

706
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.439
No, you don't have to do that.

707
00:35:44.439 --> 00:35:45.800
Just go.

708
00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.309
Please give me one more chance, sir.

709
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:50.639
I'm good at swimming.

710
00:35:50.639 --> 00:35:52.979
I'm okay with a small role. You don't even need to pay me.

711
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.150
Please give me anything to do, sir.

712
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.749
Please!

713
00:35:56.809 --> 00:35:59.079
Alright. Can you take off your clothes?

714
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.249
What?

715
00:36:01.789 --> 00:36:02.920
Why do you want that all of a sudden?

716
00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.590
It's about swimmers.

717
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.689
So I should look at your body if I want to give you a small role.

718
00:36:07.689 --> 00:36:09.189
Oh, I see. I'll take my clothes off.

719
00:36:11.959 --> 00:36:13.499
Wait, wait!

720
00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:14.900
Is that all your hair?

721
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.800
Yes, it's hair.

722
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.599
- Are your legs like that too? - Yes!

723
00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.539
- I have a lot of testosterone. - You didn't get a role.

724
00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:23.369
- What? - Zipper yourself up, and get out.

725
00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:24.539
Why?

726
00:36:24.539 --> 00:36:26.539
Have you seen any swimmers who have so much hair like you?

727
00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:28.780
They shave it all to reduce the air resistance.

728
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.019
Not only they shave their heads, they also shave their armpits.

729
00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:32.820
They even shave their most important parts too!

730
00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.720
I will shave them all.

731
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.559
Except for my head, I will get rid of every hair on my body.

732
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.130
Don't worry about it, sir!

733
00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.999
"Marine"!

734
00:37:05.249 --> 00:37:06.950
This is where you get waxed.

735
00:37:13.659 --> 00:37:15.789
Do I really have to do this?

736
00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.959
This is driving me crazy.

737
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.459
What is this?

738
00:37:19.459 --> 00:37:20.970
Who put such a worn-out doll here?

739
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:24.039
- Oh, my gosh! - Hello.

740
00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:25.769
Hi, who are you?

741
00:37:25.769 --> 00:37:27.670
I'll be waxing you today.

742
00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:29.409
Are you? Really?

743
00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:31.579
Don't be embarrassed.

744
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.249
Many men get waxed these days.

745
00:37:34.479 --> 00:37:35.510
Really?

746
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.880
I see. Let's do this. I don't have much time anyway.

747
00:37:37.979 --> 00:37:39.950
Please lie on your back. I'll start it shortly.

748
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.820
By the way, do you want me to get rid of this?

749
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.959
Just keep it. You'll need it.

750
00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:46.260
Please take off your robe.

751
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.290
I'll start now.

752
00:37:59.629 --> 00:38:01.530
Please bear the pain no matter what.

753
00:38:06.899 --> 00:38:08.569
I'll get rid of the sheet.

754
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.470
What's happening now?

755
00:38:20.249 --> 00:38:23.819
I guess that's why this is here.

756
00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:30.990
("President Ms. Bruce Lee")

757
00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:34.530
("President Ms. Bruce Lee")

758
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.530
Are you manipulating the view counts again?

759
00:38:36.629 --> 00:38:37.930
Do you have to do that?

760
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.700
Everyone does this.

761
00:38:40.339 --> 00:38:42.410
Why isn't it going up? This is annoying.

762
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:45.010
- Seo Jin. - Yes?

763
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.310
Can I borrow your ID?

764
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.640
- Why? - I want to leave some comments.

765
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:49.209
No.

766
00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.080
Seo Jin, I wrote a song.

767
00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.450
- Would you mind listening to it? - What?

768
00:38:56.019 --> 00:38:58.249
You already finished writing a song?

769
00:38:59.019 --> 00:39:01.120
A song? What song is that?

770
00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:04.060
Yoon Ah's dream is to be a rapper.

771
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.229
A rapper?

772
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:07.299
Does that mean you rap?

773
00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:08.330
Yes.

774
00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:11.269
I wrote a song while thinking about Seo Jin.

775
00:39:11.269 --> 00:39:12.339
Do you want to hear it?

776
00:39:12.339 --> 00:39:13.999
Sure, of course.

777
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.310
I didn't know this about you.

778
00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:19.609
Drop the beat.

779
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:26.819
Yes, get it

780
00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:29.419
You have eyes like a hawk

781
00:39:29.549 --> 00:39:32.120
Hunting for a scoop

782
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.519
On a hungry afternoon

783
00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:37.229
Try to fool me, show me your mind

784
00:39:37.229 --> 00:39:38.629
Hide yourself

785
00:39:38.629 --> 00:39:41.430
Once caught, you'll be smashed

786
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.269
If you're scared, freeze

787
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.240
What do you think?

788
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.310
Well, I liked it.

789
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.010
It was very unique...

790
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.919
and had a grotesque charm.

791
00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:00.549
Really?

792
00:40:00.549 --> 00:40:02.419
I have another one. Do you want to hear it too?

793
00:40:02.419 --> 00:40:06.220
No. I mean, I have to take a shower.

794
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.620
I'll hear it later. Later.

795
00:40:18.939 --> 00:40:20.939
Seo Jin, here we go.

796
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.269
Get it

797
00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:26.410
My name is Han Yoon Ah

798
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.649
In English, it's Yoon Ah Han

799
00:40:29.649 --> 00:40:32.479
Your name is Kang Seo Jin

800
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.890
Backwards, it's Jin Seo Kang

801
00:40:36.819 --> 00:40:37.890
Gosh.

802
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.120
What a surprise.

803
00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.530
How can she become a rapper like that?

804
00:40:48.359 --> 00:40:49.970
What are you doing? Get out!

805
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:51.870
I'm sorry. You should have made some sound.

806
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:53.499
How can I make a sound while taking a shower?

807
00:40:55.709 --> 00:40:56.740
Hold on.

808
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:01.209
Jun Ki. What happened to you?

809
00:41:01.209 --> 00:41:02.410
Nothing.

810
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.080
Something happened. What is this?

811
00:41:04.479 --> 00:41:06.019
- Nothing happened. - Let me see.

812
00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:07.519
Where did everything go?

813
00:41:07.519 --> 00:41:09.950
- It's just your imagination. - No, it isn't. Let me see.

814
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.089
- Stop turning me around. - Your armpits...

815
00:41:14.859 --> 00:41:17.030
What? A Brazilian wax?

816
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.629
Why did you do it?

817
00:41:18.899 --> 00:41:20.859
It was the director's order.

818
00:41:20.859 --> 00:41:22.499
I had to do it to get the role.

819
00:41:22.499 --> 00:41:24.370
You're doing all kinds of ridiculous things.

820
00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:25.669
What's your role?

821
00:41:25.669 --> 00:41:26.700
Swimmer 8.

822
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.010
You don't even have a name?

823
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.569
I'm sure you don't have any lines either.

824
00:41:30.569 --> 00:41:32.510
It's an important role.

825
00:41:32.709 --> 00:41:34.879
There's even a Swimmer 28.

826
00:41:34.879 --> 00:41:35.910
Is that so?

827
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.479
That sounds amazing. There will be 28 swimmers?

828
00:41:38.479 --> 00:41:39.549
Be quiet.

829
00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:42.249
It's Ji Soo.

830
00:41:42.549 --> 00:41:44.689
Hello. Hi, Ji Soo.

831
00:41:44.689 --> 00:41:46.060
Yes, it's me, Jun Ki.

832
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.519
Tomorrow? I don't have any plans. Why?

833
00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:49.930
With your mom?

834
00:41:50.129 --> 00:41:52.799
Of course. Okay.

835
00:41:52.799 --> 00:41:54.499
See you tomorrow. Bye.

836
00:41:54.859 --> 00:41:56.530
Did you already find a new girl?

837
00:41:57.169 --> 00:41:58.569
I wonder how many days it'll last this time.

838
00:41:58.569 --> 00:42:00.640
It's serious this time.

839
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:03.310
I'm even meeting her mom for a meal.

840
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.140
Really? It must be really serious this time.

841
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.640
It is.

842
00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.249
She feels completely different from the other girls.

843
00:42:11.379 --> 00:42:13.749
Dong Gu, when you were with Soo Ah,

844
00:42:13.749 --> 00:42:15.419
did you get this feeling here?

845
00:42:18.549 --> 00:42:20.990
Well, I guess.

846
00:42:22.959 --> 00:42:24.459
- Hey. - What?

847
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.470
I was just curious. I'm sorry.

848
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.870
No, it's okay. There's no need to be sorry.

849
00:42:34.799 --> 00:42:36.910
- Good luck. - Thanks.

850
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:38.109
Gosh.

851
00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.140
You're so insensitive.

852
00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.180
Why would you talk about Soo Ah?

853
00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.450
I didn't mean to.

854
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.749
Also, he said it was okay, so why are you having a fit?

855
00:42:46.749 --> 00:42:48.990
He doesn't seem okay.

856
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:50.890
He's okay. Worry about yourself.

857
00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:52.319
Thank you very much.

858
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:59.959
(Delete)

859
00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.479
What are you doing here?

860
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:21.019
Nothing.

861
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.749
You were thinking about Soo Ah, weren't you?

862
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.819
It's hard, right?

863
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.790
You don't have to say anything. I know how hard it is.

864
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.830
I also know that no words could comfort you.

865
00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:41.069
So I prepared something for you.

866
00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.709
What is it?

867
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.649
Yes, get it

868
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.049
A broken heart

869
00:43:54.049 --> 00:43:55.149
Tears fall down

870
00:43:55.149 --> 00:43:58.120
Candy doesn't cry even when she's lonely or sad

871
00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.560
Neither does Dong Gu

872
00:44:00.189 --> 00:44:02.560
What are you doing now? Why are you suddenly rapping?

873
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.229
Look at my eyes, Red sun

874
00:44:05.229 --> 00:44:08.399
Forget about Soo Ah, get over her

875
00:44:09.129 --> 00:44:12.100
Stop it. Why are you rapping? Have you lost your mind?

876
00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.339
Run

877
00:44:13.339 --> 00:44:14.769
Run towards your dreams

878
00:44:14.769 --> 00:44:16.740
Keep going, Where?

879
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.280
Stop it. Why are you rapping?

880
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.709
You're so weird. Why are you doing this?

881
00:44:21.709 --> 00:44:24.080
Are you ready? Let's go

882
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.580
- Stop it. - Here we go

883
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.450
- What's with you? - Yes

884
00:44:34.689 --> 00:44:36.030
Where's Jun Ki?

885
00:44:36.629 --> 00:44:39.430
He got all dressed up to meet his girlfriend's mom.

886
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:40.700
Oh, right.

887
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.470
You're working today, right?

888
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.330
Yes. I have to film a party.

889
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:45.640
Are you going to the library?

890
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.899
Yes. I'm meeting my study group.

891
00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:49.910
The link between you and me

892
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.280
The sound within us

893
00:44:54.439 --> 00:44:56.580
What's up with her?

894
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.580
Her dream is to become a rapper.

895
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.350
A rapper? When she's that bad?

896
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.350
I shouldn't have encouraged her.

897
00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:04.549
It's driving me crazy.

898
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:06.519
You encouraged her?

899
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.129
There's nothing wrong with dreaming, but she's just too bad.

900
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.830
Stop her before it's too late.

901
00:45:11.859 --> 00:45:13.560
You never know what she'll get up to.

902
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.569
She's so serious I can't bring myself to tell her.

903
00:45:15.569 --> 00:45:18.030
Find a way. I have to go now.

904
00:45:18.939 --> 00:45:20.499
- Take one. - I'm okay.

905
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.709
The link between you and me

906
00:45:22.709 --> 00:45:24.669
The sound within us

907
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:26.540
The sound

908
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:35.319
Ji Soo has been bragging about you so much,

909
00:45:35.319 --> 00:45:37.319
so I was getting curious about you.

910
00:45:37.319 --> 00:45:40.890
Just like Ji Soo said, you're very handsome and polite.

911
00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:42.290
I'm flattered, but it's not true.

912
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.459
Goodness. You're modest too.

913
00:45:44.459 --> 00:45:46.100
Thank you.

914
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.169
- Excuse me. - Go ahead.

915
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:50.370
- Hello. - Are you okay?

916
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.799
- Really? I'll be right there. - I'm nervous. Eat up.

917
00:45:53.939 --> 00:45:55.299
What should I do?

918
00:45:55.439 --> 00:45:58.410
Something came up. I have to go now.

919
00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:59.479
I'm sorry.

920
00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:00.910
No problem.

921
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.749
- Drive safely. - Okay.

922
00:46:02.749 --> 00:46:04.080
I'll say goodbye here.

923
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.720
I'm Lee Jun Ki.

924
00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:13.689
I was so nervous.

925
00:46:13.689 --> 00:46:15.290
My legs feel weak.

926
00:46:17.459 --> 00:46:18.560
How did I do?

927
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.160
My mom seems to like you a lot.

928
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.200
Really?

929
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.870
That's a relief. Good job, Jun Ki.

930
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.370
- Why is she so late? - Is someone else coming?

931
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.810
My little sister got off work early and wants to meet you.

932
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.140
I'm getting nervous again.

933
00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.350
- I'm sorry. - No problem.

934
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.080
Jun Ki, meet my sister.

935
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.950
This is my little sister, Ji Min.

936
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.850
- I'm Lee Jun Ki. - Hello.

937
00:46:50.859 --> 00:46:52.830
I'll be waxing you today.

938
00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.299
What?

939
00:46:56.499 --> 00:46:58.470
What's wrong? Have you two met before?

940
00:46:59.069 --> 00:47:00.240
Well...

941
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.939
What is it? Tell me.

942
00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:07.410
Don't tell me you two have dated.

943
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.049
- No. - No way.

944
00:47:10.049 --> 00:47:11.450
That's absurd.

945
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.819
Then what is it?

946
00:47:12.819 --> 00:47:14.850
What is it, Ji Min? Tell me.

947
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.819
The thing is, your boyfriend visited our shop...

948
00:47:18.819 --> 00:47:21.120
as a customer yesterday.

949
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:22.990
He did?

950
00:47:23.629 --> 00:47:25.290
Did you get a wax?

951
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.229
Well, it's for my role.

952
00:47:30.229 --> 00:47:31.269
It's work-related.

953
00:47:31.269 --> 00:47:33.040
That's it?

954
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.709
It's no problem as long as you didn't do it yourself.

955
00:47:40.339 --> 00:47:41.410
What is it?

956
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.410
No way.

957
00:47:44.149 --> 00:47:46.549
Did you wax him yourself?

958
00:47:46.819 --> 00:47:47.850
Say no.

959
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.549
There were no male waxers.

960
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.019
Don't get any strange idea.

961
00:47:53.019 --> 00:47:54.660
It's my work.

962
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.760
- It's work. - It's work.

963
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.689
It's just work.

964
00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.060
Ji Soo!

965
00:48:01.129 --> 00:48:02.970
Ji Soo!

966
00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:04.830
Hold on.

967
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:06.899
I'm sorry.

968
00:48:07.399 --> 00:48:11.040
I had no idea she was your sister.

969
00:48:11.169 --> 00:48:13.640
It was for a movie. I had no choice.

970
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.810
I haven't even held your hand yet,

971
00:48:15.979 --> 00:48:17.549
but my sister...

972
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.350
saw everything.

973
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.379
Everything?

974
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:24.919
Well...

975
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.819
It's her work.

976
00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:30.660
All right.

977
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.660
But I still feel a bit uncomfortable.

978
00:48:33.459 --> 00:48:34.830
I'll be going home now.

979
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:37.229
Wait, Ji Soo.

980
00:48:37.229 --> 00:48:38.629
Ji Soo!

981
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.600
My goodness.

982
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.470
Why does she have to be Ji Soo's sister?

983
00:48:43.769 --> 00:48:44.810
Gosh.

984
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.140
Darn it.

985
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.749
- Is everything going well? - Yes.

986
00:48:52.979 --> 00:48:55.319
You haven't done this in a while. Are you sure you'll be all right?

987
00:48:55.319 --> 00:48:58.089
I'm Kang Dong Gu. You know I'm good.

988
00:48:58.089 --> 00:49:00.160
If that's the case, you should be working in the film industry.

989
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.859
Why are you doing this?

990
00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:05.030
Have you given up on films too?

991
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:06.729
No, I'll start again soon.

992
00:49:07.499 --> 00:49:09.169
But I need money for that.

993
00:49:09.169 --> 00:49:11.470
You shouldn't give up like me.

994
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.339
Do it as long as you can, okay?

995
00:49:13.499 --> 00:49:14.839
Yes, thank you.

996
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:18.609
Stop crying, Min Seo.

997
00:49:18.609 --> 00:49:20.180
The party is about to start.

998
00:49:20.709 --> 00:49:22.979
Will you keep taking photos?

999
00:49:22.979 --> 00:49:24.680
- The baby is crying. - Pardon?

1000
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:26.149
What do you mean?

1001
00:49:26.149 --> 00:49:28.890
Other photographers make the baby laugh when he cries.

1002
00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:30.149
Please do something.

1003
00:49:30.149 --> 00:49:32.149
Make him laugh?

1004
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.060
I'm not a comedian.

1005
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.160
Gosh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

1006
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.060
It's his first time on the job. I apologize.

1007
00:49:39.229 --> 00:49:40.359
Excuse me.

1008
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.169
What are you doing?

1009
00:49:44.169 --> 00:49:46.370
What should I do about the baby crying?

1010
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:49.609
You have to be better at making babies laugh for this job.

1011
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.839
Watch carefully.

1012
00:49:53.209 --> 00:49:54.510
Min Seo.

1013
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.780
Look at me.

1014
00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.089
Peekaboo.

1015
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.959
He's so adorable.

1016
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.629
Did you see that?

1017
00:50:16.729 --> 00:50:17.870
This is how you do it.

1018
00:50:18.269 --> 00:50:19.370
You try it.

1019
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:20.740
Are you telling me to try it?

1020
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.939
Do you think earning money is easy?

1021
00:50:23.669 --> 00:50:25.780
Forget it if you don't want to. Leave.

1022
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.379
No, I'll do it.

1023
00:50:28.379 --> 00:50:29.580
Do it well.

1024
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.080
Do it well, okay?

1025
00:50:52.399 --> 00:50:54.700
Seo Jin, may I borrow your laptop?

1026
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:56.169
Why do you need it?

1027
00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.470
I need to apply to participate in something.

1028
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:59.680
Participate in what?

1029
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.249
I want to go on "Show Me the Money".

1030
00:51:02.649 --> 00:51:04.680
"Show Me the Money"?

1031
00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.979
I want to be evaluated by professionals.

1032
00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.919
Yoon Ah, isn't it too early for that?

1033
00:51:11.919 --> 00:51:12.959
I know.

1034
00:51:12.959 --> 00:51:15.319
I know that my rap isn't at a professional level.

1035
00:51:15.629 --> 00:51:18.430
However, I think I can overcome it.

1036
00:51:20.229 --> 00:51:21.600
Listen, Yoon Ah.

1037
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.700
I didn't say it as not to hurt your feelings,

1038
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.269
but your rap is terrible.

1039
00:51:26.499 --> 00:51:27.769
What do you mean?

1040
00:51:27.769 --> 00:51:29.609
It's terrible in every way.

1041
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.680
Is my rap that bad?

1042
00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.510
Most people can rap like you.

1043
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.580
I can do it too. Want to hear it?

1044
00:51:38.649 --> 00:51:42.220
Insomnia, restlessness, I'm a zombie in the air

1045
00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.819
With some refreshing water, I can remove the weight of reality

1046
00:51:45.819 --> 00:51:49.530
My running is beautiful like there are flames behind my feet

1047
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.399
See? Don't you think I'm better than you?

1048
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:54.060
I see.

1049
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:56.629
I see how it is.

1050
00:51:57.629 --> 00:51:59.200
Why didn't you tell me before?

1051
00:51:59.439 --> 00:52:00.839
I'm sorry.

1052
00:52:01.999 --> 00:52:05.510
- I didn't want to hurt your... - No, it's okay.

1053
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:07.609
Don't worry.

1054
00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.019
Was I being too harsh?

1055
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:18.850
I shouldn't have encouraged her.

1056
00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:20.790
I don't know anymore.

1057
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.629
Gosh, the noodles got soggy.

1058
00:52:25.629 --> 00:52:27.530
- I'm so hungry. - You're back.

1059
00:52:27.999 --> 00:52:29.870
What's wrong? Did something happen?

1060
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:31.069
Don't ask.

1061
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:33.399
Did you make that just now?

1062
00:52:34.269 --> 00:52:35.499
Let me have one bite.

1063
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:40.780
No way.

1064
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.350
Make your own if you want some.

1065
00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:45.350
Didn't you eat with your girlfriend's mom?

1066
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:46.850
I couldn't eat properly.

1067
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.479
Let me have a bite. Give it to me.

1068
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:52.120
Make your own.

1069
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.390
You're so stingy.

1070
00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.459
Let me have one bite.

1071
00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.660
Are you holding on to it?

1072
00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.830
You're so strong. Do you lift weights?

1073
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.200
- Hey. - Give it back. I made it.

1074
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.530
My goodness.

1075
00:53:07.999 --> 00:53:09.470
You just wasted it.

1076
00:53:09.569 --> 00:53:10.669
What's going on?

1077
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.580
It's seeping through.

1078
00:53:25.278 --> 00:53:26.709
- Kang Seo Jin. - I'm sorry.

1079
00:53:26.808 --> 00:53:28.178
I'm so sorry.

1080
00:53:28.578 --> 00:53:30.419
Am I useless as a man now?

1081
00:53:30.419 --> 00:53:32.649
Doctor, what should I do?

1082
00:53:32.649 --> 00:53:34.218
My life is over.

1083
00:53:34.792 --> 00:53:36.161
Kang Seo Jin.

1084
00:53:38.391 --> 00:53:39.991
How could you?

1085
00:53:41.402 --> 00:53:44.201
What are you doing? Can't you do something?

1086
00:53:44.201 --> 00:53:45.272
I'm sorry.

1087
00:53:45.272 --> 00:53:47.601
Could you call the professor again?

1088
00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:49.241
- Please? - She's on her way.

1089
00:53:50.442 --> 00:53:53.672
Why did you call me when I just finished an operation?

1090
00:53:53.772 --> 00:53:57.811
It's because the intern is too embarrassed to see the patient.

1091
00:53:57.811 --> 00:54:00.482
Do you call yourself a doctor?

1092
00:54:00.482 --> 00:54:02.482
I'll have a word with you later.

1093
00:54:02.781 --> 00:54:05.451
What happened to the patient?

1094
00:54:06.552 --> 00:54:09.292
- Is that you, Jun Ki? - Who is it?

1095
00:54:10.462 --> 00:54:13.261
It's me, Ji Soo's mom.

1096
00:54:13.261 --> 00:54:14.802
Mom, could you do something?

1097
00:54:14.802 --> 00:54:15.931
You startled me.

1098
00:54:19.302 --> 00:54:20.402
Ma'am.

1099
00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:22.442
What brings you here?

1100
00:54:22.442 --> 00:54:23.942
I'm a doctor at this hospital.

1101
00:54:24.112 --> 00:54:26.371
What happened to you?

1102
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:28.342
He spilled hot ramyeon over him.

1103
00:54:29.011 --> 00:54:31.252
My goodness.

1104
00:54:31.451 --> 00:54:33.252
Let's take a look first.

1105
00:54:33.252 --> 00:54:34.351
Ma'am.

1106
00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:37.451
No, it's okay.

1107
00:54:37.552 --> 00:54:38.822
I'm okay.

1108
00:54:38.922 --> 00:54:41.261
I'll go back home now.

1109
00:54:42.721 --> 00:54:45.792
You're not okay. You can't go in this condition.

1110
00:54:45.792 --> 00:54:46.991
No, ma'am.

1111
00:54:47.132 --> 00:54:49.031
I'm really okay.

1112
00:54:49.502 --> 00:54:53.101
Listen to me. I'm a doctor before I'm Ji Soo's mom.

1113
00:54:53.402 --> 00:54:54.701
Ms. Kim, hold down the patient.

1114
00:54:54.701 --> 00:54:56.672
- Yes, ma'am. - Hold down what? Why?

1115
00:54:57.371 --> 00:54:58.542
Why?

1116
00:54:58.741 --> 00:54:59.842
Stay still.

1117
00:54:59.842 --> 00:55:01.511
No, no.

1118
00:55:01.982 --> 00:55:04.152
Ma'am, no.

1119
00:55:04.152 --> 00:55:05.652
- No. - Stay still.

1120
00:55:05.652 --> 00:55:07.581
- No, ma'am. - Don't move.

1121
00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:09.922
No, don't do it.

1122
00:55:09.922 --> 00:55:11.192
Don't!

1123
00:55:29.741 --> 00:55:31.772
What happened?

1124
00:55:34.882 --> 00:55:35.982
I'm sorry.

1125
00:55:45.192 --> 00:55:49.621
It's rare to be burnt like this with hot ramyeon.

1126
00:55:49.792 --> 00:55:51.661
So that was why.

1127
00:55:51.792 --> 00:55:52.862
Yes.

1128
00:55:53.192 --> 00:55:55.061
The treatment went well.

1129
00:55:55.061 --> 00:55:56.862
- You may go. - Thank you.

1130
00:55:57.601 --> 00:55:58.701
Ma'am.

1131
00:56:03.241 --> 00:56:04.371
Jun Ki.

1132
00:56:06.612 --> 00:56:07.882
Ji Soo.

1133
00:56:08.081 --> 00:56:09.882
Hello.

1134
00:56:10.011 --> 00:56:12.451
I need to make rounds. See you.

1135
00:56:13.011 --> 00:56:15.581
I'll be outside, Jun Ki.

1136
00:56:19.322 --> 00:56:20.922
Ji Soo.

1137
00:56:20.922 --> 00:56:23.862
Why do you do this to me, Jun Ki?

1138
00:56:24.192 --> 00:56:26.092
You got a wax from my sister.

1139
00:56:26.331 --> 00:56:27.831
And now my mom.

1140
00:56:27.831 --> 00:56:30.161
Are you planning to show it to all my family except me?

1141
00:56:30.802 --> 00:56:33.471
How can I look at my mom and sister now?

1142
00:56:33.632 --> 00:56:35.672
- Listen, Ji Soo. - Forget it.

1143
00:56:35.971 --> 00:56:37.201
I don't want to hear it.

1144
00:56:37.411 --> 00:56:38.712
Let's break up.

1145
00:56:38.712 --> 00:56:41.011
What? Break up?

1146
00:56:41.011 --> 00:56:42.911
- What do you mean? - I'm sorry.

1147
00:56:43.112 --> 00:56:44.681
I don't think I can bear it.

1148
00:56:45.712 --> 00:56:47.081
Goodbye, Jun Ki.

1149
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:49.982
We were fine. Wait, Ji Soo.

1150
00:56:50.281 --> 00:56:51.351
Ji Soo.

1151
00:56:54.022 --> 00:56:55.621
Ji Soo. Ji Soo.

1152
00:56:58.031 --> 00:57:00.161
Wait, Ji Soo.

1153
00:57:01.031 --> 00:57:03.232
Ji Soo, please listen to me.

1154
00:57:03.531 --> 00:57:04.831
Ji Soo.

1155
00:57:05.232 --> 00:57:06.672
Ji Soo!

1156
00:57:15.281 --> 00:57:19.112
There are three bears in the house

1157
00:57:19.112 --> 00:57:22.382
Daddy bear, mommy bear, and baby bear

1158
00:57:25.922 --> 00:57:27.261
What are you doing?

1159
00:57:27.422 --> 00:57:28.822
You're making him cry more.

1160
00:57:28.822 --> 00:57:30.632
- Is there anything else? - Something else?

1161
00:57:30.632 --> 00:57:31.661
I'll try again.

1162
00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:03.592
Our son, Min Seo. Thank you for being in our lives.

1163
00:58:03.822 --> 00:58:05.232
Happy first birthday.

1164
00:58:05.331 --> 00:58:06.792
We love you forever.

1165
00:58:26.612 --> 00:58:30.382
Did you hit your head until it bled?

1166
00:58:34.022 --> 00:58:36.692
I had to do it to make the baby laugh. I had no choice.

1167
00:58:37.491 --> 00:58:39.991
It's hard to make a living.

1168
00:58:39.991 --> 00:58:41.101
It's hard.

1169
00:58:42.402 --> 00:58:45.371
Ji Soo, please listen to me.

1170
00:58:45.601 --> 00:58:47.871
Don't hang up, Ji Soo.

1171
00:58:47.871 --> 00:58:49.302
I didn't do it on purpose.

1172
00:58:49.371 --> 00:58:51.942
Please hear me out, Ji Soo. Ji Soo, wait.

1173
00:58:54.681 --> 00:58:56.141
Why? Does she really want to break up?

1174
00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:57.252
Yes.

1175
00:58:58.152 --> 00:59:00.181
Why did you get a waxing in the first place?

1176
00:59:00.552 --> 00:59:04.022
Extras like me don't have a choice but to do as the directors say.

1177
00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:06.252
I'm sure you'll meet someone better.

1178
00:59:06.621 --> 00:59:07.661
Cheer up.

1179
00:59:09.061 --> 00:59:11.092
I'm sad about breaking up with Ji Soo,

1180
00:59:11.161 --> 00:59:14.232
but the thought that I might end up being an extra forever...

1181
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:16.061
makes me feel depressed.

1182
00:59:16.061 --> 00:59:18.172
Why would you say such a foolish thing like that?

1183
00:59:18.831 --> 00:59:20.802
Jun Ki. The actor, Hwang Jung Min,

1184
00:59:20.802 --> 00:59:22.772
was an obscure actor for ten years,

1185
00:59:22.772 --> 00:59:25.212
and Kwak Do Won was an obscure actor for almost twenty years.

1186
00:59:25.212 --> 00:59:26.212
So what are you saying?

1187
00:59:26.572 --> 00:59:28.212
Are you saying I'll be an extra for twenty years?

1188
00:59:28.212 --> 00:59:29.681
I'm trying to tell you that if you work hard you could become...

1189
00:59:29.681 --> 00:59:32.081
a great actor like Hwang Jung Min or Kwak Do Won.

1190
00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:35.351
You might slack off at times, but you do have talent in acting.

1191
00:59:36.252 --> 00:59:39.322
You're right. I am pretty good.

1192
00:59:39.322 --> 00:59:40.621
People do say I have talent.

1193
00:59:40.891 --> 00:59:44.192
Gosh. Let's cheer up guys.

1194
00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:48.132
If we stay positive, I'm sure someday our dreams will come true.

1195
00:59:48.132 --> 00:59:49.601
He's right. I agree.

1196
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:51.471
But in order to cheer up,

1197
00:59:51.931 --> 00:59:54.902
let's eat first. What do you say? I'm starving. Let's eat.

1198
00:59:54.902 --> 00:59:57.741
- You're always hungry. - When are you ever not hungry?

1199
00:59:57.741 --> 00:59:59.172
Answer me right now. Tell me.

1200
00:59:59.641 --> 01:00:00.882
I see muffins!

1201
01:00:02.942 --> 01:00:05.152
These will have to do for dinner today.

1202
01:00:05.482 --> 01:00:08.781
I wasn't in the mood to go grocery shopping, so I just made muffins.

1203
01:00:08.781 --> 01:00:09.922
Yoon Ah.

1204
01:00:10.451 --> 01:00:11.851
Are you still mad?

1205
01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:13.851
No. I'm not mad at all.

1206
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:16.522
I'm perfectly fine. I couldn't be happier.

1207
01:00:17.022 --> 01:00:20.462
I see. You're not angry. You don't seem angry at all.

1208
01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:29.172
- You made this yourself? - Why?

1209
01:00:29.572 --> 01:00:31.572
Can you bake muffins as well as I do?

1210
01:00:31.741 --> 01:00:34.281
Does everyone in the world bake as well as me?

1211
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:36.542
It's not that. It's really good.

1212
01:00:36.781 --> 01:00:39.281
You guys should try one too. Try one.

1213
01:00:39.281 --> 01:00:40.581
- Shall we? - Let's give it a try.

1214
01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.761
It really is good.

1215
01:00:48.761 --> 01:00:50.792
Yoon Ah. Did you really bake these yourself?

1216
01:00:50.891 --> 01:00:53.362
I agree. This is better than the ones sold in bakeries.

1217
01:00:53.362 --> 01:00:55.201
- Yes, I agree. - Really?

1218
01:00:55.201 --> 01:00:56.661
Believe me.

1219
01:00:56.831 --> 01:00:59.272
Yoon Ah. Rather than a rapper, why don't you...

1220
01:00:59.272 --> 01:01:01.201
try becoming a pastry chef?

1221
01:01:01.201 --> 01:01:02.802
A pastry chef?

1222
01:01:02.802 --> 01:01:05.672
To be honest, my second dream was to become a pastry chef.

1223
01:01:05.672 --> 01:01:08.281
Really? Then you should try becoming a pastry chef.

1224
01:01:08.281 --> 01:01:11.811
Should I? But I still want to become a rapper.

1225
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:14.522
- Yoon Ah. - All right. I was just kidding.

1226
01:01:16.081 --> 01:01:17.391
- Is it really good? - Yes.

1227
01:01:17.391 --> 01:01:18.422
You should become a pastry chef.

1228
01:01:18.422 --> 01:01:19.851
It's pretty tasty.

1229
01:01:19.851 --> 01:01:21.822
- Really? - You've found a talent.

1230
01:01:21.822 --> 01:01:22.822
It's really good?

1231
01:01:30.672 --> 01:01:32.201
That's nice and neat. I like it.

1232
01:01:32.402 --> 01:01:33.831
That's good. Let's go with that.

1233
01:01:36.502 --> 01:01:39.272
Hey. I like it. You look great.

1234
01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:41.942
What did I tell you? Now that you've gotten rid of the hair,

1235
01:01:41.942 --> 01:01:44.252
you look like a real swimmer.

1236
01:01:44.252 --> 01:01:46.811
Thank you. I'll do my best.

1237
01:01:47.752 --> 01:01:50.721
Gosh. Did you even shave your armpits?

1238
01:01:52.152 --> 01:01:53.962
Good job. Next person!

1239
01:01:55.121 --> 01:01:56.161
Yes!

1240
01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:57.692
My goodness. You startled me.

1241
01:01:58.491 --> 01:02:01.931
Did you really shave you head?

1242
01:02:01.931 --> 01:02:03.261
Yes, sir.

1243
01:02:05.101 --> 01:02:08.002
As long as it makes me look like a real swimmer, I don't need my hair.

1244
01:02:08.471 --> 01:02:10.572
I love it. I'm really impressed.

1245
01:02:10.572 --> 01:02:12.542
This is what a true actor should be like.

1246
01:02:12.542 --> 01:02:14.281
Director. Soo Hyun has arrived.

1247
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:15.882
- Really? - Yes, sir.

1248
01:02:17.141 --> 01:02:19.982
It's cold. I'm freezing. Let's hurry up and shoot the scene.

1249
01:02:20.721 --> 01:02:22.882
Soo Hyun. You didn't get a wax?

1250
01:02:22.882 --> 01:02:25.221
You know how I can't stand the cold.

1251
01:02:25.221 --> 01:02:26.991
I'd be too cold without hair. I'll catch a cold.

1252
01:02:26.991 --> 01:02:28.822
This is about swimmers.

1253
01:02:28.822 --> 01:02:31.331
If you act like this it won't look as real.

1254
01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.391
Director.

1255
01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:35.962
My role is a swimmer. I'm not a swimmer in real life, am I?

1256
01:02:36.101 --> 01:02:39.132
If you insist on getting a wax, you should look for another actor.

1257
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:41.072
No, no. That's not what I'm saying.

1258
01:02:41.072 --> 01:02:43.502
It's not that important how real this looks.

1259
01:02:43.502 --> 01:02:44.911
Let's go ahead and shoot the scene.

1260
01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:47.581
Wait. Why do these guys look so sleek?

1261
01:02:47.741 --> 01:02:49.382
They'll make me stand out.

1262
01:02:49.382 --> 01:02:51.112
The viewers won't be happy about that.

1263
01:02:51.112 --> 01:02:52.552
I can't shoot this like this.

1264
01:02:52.552 --> 01:02:55.851
Gosh. You're right. What should we do?

1265
01:02:56.822 --> 01:02:59.451
We'll now shoot the scene where the spectators cheer.

1266
01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:03.161
Everyone must cheer with emotion as if this were real.

1267
01:03:03.161 --> 01:03:04.232
Yes, sir.

1268
01:03:04.362 --> 01:03:07.601

I told you to go easy on him.
