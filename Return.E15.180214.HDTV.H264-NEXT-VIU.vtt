00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:06.850
(We deeply regret for causing any inconvenience.)

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.390
(We will strive in order to avoid disappointing our viewers.)

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.950
(We will strive in order to avoid disappointing our viewers.)

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.490
Previously on Return.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.089
You are under arrest for murdering and abandoning the body of Ms. Yum.

6
00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.000
I will prove In Ho's innocence.

7
00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.069
I want 1,000,000 dollars each from you and Oh Tae Suk.

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.700
- Shot. - What do you think this is?

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.440
(Courthouse)

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.770
Let me ask you again.

11
00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.639
Do you have a sister?

12
00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:35.910
(Witness)

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.650
Did you know the victim 10 years ago?

14
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.519
No, I didn't.

15
00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.260
Let me change my question.

16
00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.859
10 years ago, a case...

17
00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.559
had affected your family quite significantly.

18
00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.199
You are aware that the victim...

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.870
was involved in the case I just mentioned, aren't you?

20
00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.870
Yes, I am aware.

21
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.609
Could you please explain the case 10 years ago?

22
00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.439
- Or should I... - 10 years ago,

23
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.579
because of her big mouth,

24
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.549
my sister had become a crazy woman.

25
00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.219
She told me that she was going to a part-time job her friend set up.

26
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.859
Jung Soo.

27
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.960
Hey. How do I look? Tell me.

28
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.630
Hey, you're a student. You should be studying.

29
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600
Why do you keep looking at yourself in the mirror?

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.229
You should study. I'm going to make money.

31
00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.899
Studying has its own timing.

32
00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.000
Jung Soo, how do I look?

33
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.010
Do I look like a 20-year-old? Do I?

34
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
Why would you want to look like a 20-year-old?

35
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.980
I'm going to do the part-time job Yeon A set up for me.

36
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.609
That work pays 20 dollars per hour.

37
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.049
I have to look older than 20 years old.

38
00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.750
Hey. Go back to your room.

39
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.620
Mark my words. I'll come back with a handful of money.

40
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.060
Beat it. Come on.

41
00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:57.260
- Don't you dare leave this house. - Whatever.

42
00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.700
What a lunatic.

43
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.269
I should have stopped her from leaving even if I had to scold her.

44
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.200
Soo Hyun, who went to work, didn't return home.

45
00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.569
Even when the sun had gone down and come up the next day.

46
00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.609
I was about to leave my house to file for a missing person.

47
00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.620
But I got a call.

48
00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.019
Hello?

49
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.150
- Is this Kim Soo Hyun's house? - Yes, it is.

50
00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.659
(Kind Police, Every Step of the Way)

51
00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.400
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.400
- Jung Soo. - What happened to you, Soo Hyun?

53
00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.669
Jung Soo.

54
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.509
What happened? Did someone hit you?

55
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.210
- Jung Soo. - My gosh.

56
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.750
Who was the assailant that had raped your sister?

57
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.479
Seo Joon Hee from Daemyung Hospital,

58
00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.289
and Kim Hak Bum from Myoungseong Foundation.

59
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.490
Please refrain from using people's real names.

60
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.060
But I have a question.

61
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.960
Did you receive a scholarship...

62
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.530
as a settlement from the person who sexually assaulted your sister?

63
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.400
Yes.

64
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.069
Your Honor, I cannot find the relevance of that case...

65
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.009
to the present case.

66
00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.710
Let's let them continue.

67
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.280
The person who proposed the job to her...

68
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.919
was the victim of this case,

69
00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.259
who had just opened her first business.

70
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.689
Although she knew that Kim Soo Hyun was a minor,

71
00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.759
she introduced her to those two men,

72
00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.729
and after the incident,

73
00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.939
she lied to the authorities...

74
00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.509
that Kim Soo Hyun had lied about her age.

75
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.370
Is that correct?

76
00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.180
They did drugs,

77
00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.039
assaulted a person,

78
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.310
and gang-raped a minor,

79
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.280
but they were not punished at all.

80
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.889
Rather...

81
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.159
Rather,

82
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.530
they accused my sister...

83
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.199
of fabricating the incident to extort money from them.

84
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.229
The defendant and another friend...

85
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.069
made elaborate plans to make Kim Soo Hyun...

86
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.199
appear to be a seductress after their money.

87
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.680
Isn't that why you framed the defendant,

88
00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:27.750
who was having an affair with the victim?

89
00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.550
Objection. Speculation.

90
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.810
Objection sustained.

91
00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.219
Witness. Why did you accept Daemyung's scholarship?

92
00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.189
You need to be qualified to even say...

93
00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.090
that you are being wronged.

94
00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.060
I was not qualified.

95
00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.300
I went to a med school in the suburbs,

96
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.670
took time off frequently,

97
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.430
and didn't have great grades.

98
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.769
Still, how could you take that money?

99
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.370
So you decided to take revenge since you had the power now?

100
00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.139
Your Honor.

101
00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:01.279
No.

102
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.149
Who am I to take revenge on anyone?

103
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.519
What right does someone like me have?

104
00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.670
This is a total jackpot.

105
00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.509
It was a total mess. It was like a warzone.

106
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.819
Weren't you at Kang In Ho's trial?

107
00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:40.220
A witness named Kim Jung Soo came forward.

108
00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.019
He choked that attorney, Choi Ja Hye.

109
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.290
What was that?

110
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.790
Why do you sound angry?

111
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.389
When was I angry?

112
00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:51.730
I was just shocked.

113
00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:52.860
Anyway,

114
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.769
that witness' younger sister...

115
00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:58.300
was tied to Yum Mi Jung and the problematic four...

116
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.699
through a gang-rape incident 10 years ago.

117
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.939
His sister was involved...

118
00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.750
in a gang-rape case with Yum Mi Jung and the four 10 years ago?

119
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.480
Sir.

120
00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.980
Well, you should segregate the assailant and the victim first.

121
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.120
Sure. I guess.

122
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.730
Excuse me.

123
00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:27.730
Hey.

124
00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:30.100
- Hi. - Are you okay?

125
00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.810
Kim Jung Soo. Kim Soo Hyun.

126
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.980
It couldn't be.

127
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.490
Learn how to knock.

128
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.389
I have no time to waste on knocking.

129
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.129
Freak. What is it?

130
00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:00.870
I mean...

131
00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:07.610
This is insane.

132
00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:09.410
Kim Byung Gi...

133
00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:11.279
is alive.

134
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.610
What gibberish.

135
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.610
Right?

136
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.050
That's what Choi Ja Hye said.

137
00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:18.879
Choi Ja Hye...

138
00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:20.990
The one that I know?

139
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.319
After I talked with you,

140
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.189
I went to his shop,

141
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.529
and she was there...

142
00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:29.360
to see him.

143
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.399
You're not making any sense.

144
00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:35.730
She says she spoke to him...

145
00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:37.470
the day she went to see him.

146
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.279
Why didn't you tell me before?

147
00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.310
Are you insane?

148
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.649
In case you'd call me insane.

149
00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:56.720
Hey.

150
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.259
Are you sure you killed him back then?

151
00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:20.339
Hey. Couldn't we have had...

152
00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.149
Mr. Kim do this instead?

153
00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:25.220
How can we trust that rat?

154
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.319
Who knows when he'll stab us in the back?

155
00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:31.720
- Be careful what you say. - Gosh. Seriously.

156
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.300
Here it is.

157
00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:50.810
Cut it open.

158
00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:18.070
(Sarang-ro Gas Station)

159
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.879
Hey. Look at this mess you've caused.

160
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:27.480
Why is this my fault?

161
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.350
It's Choi Ja Hye's fault. She's the worst.

162
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.820
You freaked out about nothing.

163
00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:34.450
You haven't changed at all.

164
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:37.389
Hey.

165
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.090
What's your problem?

166
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.929
Are you trying to blame me?

167
00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:45.200
Hey, hey, hey. Forget it.

168
00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:53.070
Psycho freak.

169
00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.639
You little scumbag.

170
00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:02.309
You're the one who did it.

171
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.509
Shut it.

172
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.649
No, I will not.

173
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.690
You think you're the best, don't you?

174
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.990
Right?

175
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.730
That's why you always did as you wanted since we were young.

176
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.830
Whatever you wanted.

177
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.629
You threw fists before thinking and always caused trouble.

178
00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:21.600
In Ho and I always fixed them for you.

179
00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:24.740
- Did you forget? - You psycho.

180
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.309
You're the one who pushed Joon Hee off the cliff,

181
00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:32.409
and you're the one who shot Byung Gi to death.

182
00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:34.779
You're the one who made this situation...

183
00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:36.409
- into a complete mess! - You lunatic.

184
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.220
What are you trying to do?

185
00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:39.620
It stinks, right?

186
00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:42.950
Talk.

187
00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:44.590
Talk.

188
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.490
Talk. Talk...

189
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:56.899
Shoot!

190
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.470
Hey.

191
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.940
Hey!

193

194
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.549
Get back here, you rat!

195
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.149
Get back here, you rat!

198
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.980
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.110

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.090
(Courthouse)

201
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.360
Defense, present your closing statement.

202
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.120
(Case: Kang In Ho, 4th day of trial)

203
00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:57.059
The victim was alive when the defendant left the penthouse.

204
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.500
We obtained a statement that she was indeed alive,

205
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.169
and thus the prosecutor's claim...

206
00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:05.000
that she was murdered behind closed doors was not proved.

207
00:12:05.539 --> 00:12:08.610
Due to the unreasonable investigation and detainment,

208
00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:10.070
his reputation...

209
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.639
and the brand image of the company where he worked,

210
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.049
suffered a huge loss.

211
00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:18.919
Not only is he not guilty of murder and abandoning the body,

212
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.649
we must also consider defamation committed against him.

213
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.190
That is all.

214
00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:29.090
(Courthouse)

215
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.500
If there is a possibility that the victim was alive...

216
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.100
during the time the defendant is accused of murdering the victim,

217
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.440
there is reasonable doubt in finding the defendant guilty.

218
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.779
Therefore, the law favors the defendant.

219
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.450
And thus, as the law dictates,

220
00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:52.379
we find the defendant...

221
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.789
not guilty.

222
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.330
Congratulations.

- Tell us your opinion. - Mr. Kang.

- Mr. Kang. - Share a word.

232

- Mr. Kang, a comment, please. - One comment, please.

A glass of this costs 80,000 dollars.

239
00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:11.360
Hey, have the whole bottle to yourself.

240
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.129
Drink all of it.

241

- I don't want that. - Come here.

244

- Come closer. - My goodness.

245
00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:33.950
Hey, did In Ho win a gold medal or something?

246
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:37.889
I did win a gold medal with fencing.

247
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.960
No one gets acquitted of a murder charge.

248
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:44.860
But it happened to In Ho.

249
00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:49.299
- My goodness. - Hey.

250
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.500
You guys are making me laugh for the first time in two months.

251
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.639
Yes, smile. Please smile.

252
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.840
Look at me.

253
00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:00.809
Everyone found out that I was Mr. K from the case 10 years ago.

254
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:03.549
My name was the fifth most-searched keywords online.

255
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:06.279
Even my university is throwing a fit.

256
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.220
They are protesting that a rapist-professor should be fired.

257
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.690
But look at me. Look how happy I am.

258
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.629
Hey, but you know what? Why was I only the fifth most-searched word?

259
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.460
That jerk, Joon Hee, had his name being the third most-searched name.

260
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.970
You crazy jerk.

261
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.500
So your names went viral?

262
00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:27.100
They wrote articles about them. It was quite a mess.

263
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.970
Dad managed to shut the articles down,

264
00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:31.480
but some people still wrote about the incident...

265
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.210
on some online blogs.

266
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.950
I'm sorry about that. I stirred up the hornet's nest.

267
00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:42.389
Forget it. We should put it behind us and go back to our lives.

268
00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:44.960
No. I can't do that.

269
00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:50.090
This isn't over until the real killer is apprehended.

270
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.669
Right. What about Joon Hee? How is he?

271
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:05.009
He's the same.

272
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.919
We must also catch whoever did that to Joon Hee.

273
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.320
Do you guys know anything about who it might have been?

274

Well, Joon Hee...

276
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.159
I heard he was attacked...

277
00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:28.529
when he was coming to the precinct to clear my name.

278

Is that something one can easily buy on the market?

I doubt it. It's a medical supply hospitals use.

It is only available from pharmacies inside hospitals.

Did you report it to the police?

Sure.

where were you at the time when the drug was stolen?

I was at the hospital for my shift.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.559
Everyone is busy at the hospital. They can't remember the exact time.

333
00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:19.089
It sounds like no one can confirm it.

334
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.289
I am stating there is no reason for such act.

335
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.859
I am not relevant to that case.

336
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.160
Coincidentally,

337
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.339
you were the last person who talked with...

338
00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:33.039
Yum Mi Jung on the phone.

339
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.240
And you were also interviewed...

340
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.309
regarding the disappearance of the drug at the hospital.

341
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.609
It's another coincidence that the drug used...

342
00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:46.480
in the process of murdering Yum Mi Jung was the same one...

343
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.890
that disappeared from the hospital. Isn't it?

344
00:21:52.589 --> 00:21:54.160
You only have circumstantial evidence,

345
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.589
but not concrete evidence.

346
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.400
It was just like this 10 years ago.

347
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.769
It was just my sister's statement.

348
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.069
Someone went free because there wasn't...

349
00:22:04.069 --> 00:22:05.670
any evidence that could support her statement.

350
00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:07.539
Is that why you murdered her?

351
00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:09.440
Is that why you killed Yum Mi Jung...

352
00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:12.809
and framed Kang In Ho for the act?

353
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.250
He won't be on the receiving end.

354
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.480
If I were to kill, it would've been Kim Hak Bum or Seo Joon Hee.

355
00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:20.480
There's no way I would kill Yum Mi Jung.

356
00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:23.750
Besides, just like everyone said,

357
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.160
I'm a jerk who has been living in comfort after selling my sister.

358
00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:30.359
Do you think a selfish jerk like me would kill someone for my sister?

359
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.759
Please.

360
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.200
I really hope that you aren't the killer.

361
00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:40.240
I need to work out.

362
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.740
I'll get going if you're done with your questions.

363
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.910
And...

364
00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:50.509
if you do this again without a warrant,

365
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.650
I'll get angry.

366
00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:54.190
Have a nice day.

367
00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:13.569
How did it go?

368
00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:15.140
It isn't easy.

369
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.910
Have some morning coffee.

370
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.009
Request a search warrant for Kim Jung Soo's home.

371
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.250
Okay.

372
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.259
Gosh, that must hurt. Seriously.

373
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.000
You have a guest, sir.

374
00:23:42.369 --> 00:23:43.599
Shoot.

375
00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:45.539
What is it?

376
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.009
I'm a detective with Gangdong Precinct.

377
00:23:56.109 --> 00:23:57.109
Please.

378
00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.950
You know Kim Byung Gi, don't you?

379
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:03.089
Byung Gi. Byung Gi, you say.

380
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.359
I'm sorry, Detective. I don't remember.

381
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.660
He was your alibi last time.

382
00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:17.400
That Byung Gi.

383
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.900
Byung Gi, yes, Byung Gi.

384
00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:22.710
Why did you pretend...

385
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.309
not to know him?

386
00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:25.539
Well...

387
00:24:27.109 --> 00:24:30.150
I study a lot, so my brain is packed with information,

388
00:24:30.349 --> 00:24:32.619
and it overloaded. I temporarily forgot.

389
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:35.450
This is about Kim Byung Gi's disappearance.

390
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.019
Please cooperate with us.

391
00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:41.029
But Detective,

392
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.230
is Byung Gi...

393
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:44.930
dead?

394
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.230
I never said he was dead.

395
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.970
Please come with me.

396
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.009
You can talk to my attorney about that. Hold on.

397
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.079
You may not know,

398
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.579
but college classes are long.

399
00:25:03.849 --> 00:25:07.650
I have about 10 hours of lectures to give,

400
00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:11.319
so feel free to wait if you want or leave.

401
00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:13.589
If you're going to wait,

402
00:25:14.329 --> 00:25:15.359
order some food.

403
00:25:15.859 --> 00:25:16.859
I'll let them know.

404
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.500
That's right. Make it less than 30 dollars.

405
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.730
Don't get fired later, okay?

406
00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.339
Good luck!

407
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:36.710
Why are you being so obvious?

408
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.319
Hey, you. Get out.

409
00:25:40.349 --> 00:25:41.650
Get out now.

410
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:50.089
Shoot.

411
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.130
This is insane.

412
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:56.269
How did he associate me to him?

413
00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.599
Darn it.

414
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.109
What now?

415
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.410
Hey.

416
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.609
Are you really going to answer my calls like that?

417
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.480
What is it?

418
00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:12.579
What is it?

419
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.619
A detective came.

420
00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:17.250
He asked about Byung Gi.

421
00:26:19.589 --> 00:26:21.930
- What did you say? - I was natural,

422
00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:23.559
so he wouldn't notice.

423
00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:25.029
Keep denying it.

424
00:26:28.829 --> 00:26:29.869
You think...

425
00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:33.400
I'm a moron, don't you?

426
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640
Right?

427
00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:39.140
Watch yourself.

428
00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:57.759
I have a warrant, so it's fine for us to meet again, right?

429
00:27:02.369 --> 00:27:04.269
Check as much as you need.

430
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:06.740
I can leave you alone...

431
00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:08.910
if that would make you more comfortable.

432
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.109
That won't be necessary.

433
00:27:39.299 --> 00:27:40.569
What is this for?

434
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.779
I play the contrabass in a teachers' association.

435
00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:48.579
I see.

436
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:57.819
What a unique woman.

437
00:27:57.819 --> 00:27:59.160
How morbid.

438
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:11.140
That's right. I gave it to Rachel.

439
00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:12.539
Giving paintings...

440
00:28:13.569 --> 00:28:14.569
isn't a crime, is it?

441
00:28:15.339 --> 00:28:16.410
That's right.

442
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:25.119
Gosh.

443
00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:28.119
Do you volunteer too?

444
00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:29.549
It's nothing much.

445
00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.119
Some people got together to donate our talent.

446
00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:34.730
Would you like some tea?

447
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.160
Yes, thank you.

448
00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:11.130
- Here you go. - Thank you.

449
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.230
May I use the restroom?

450
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.930
That way.

451
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.380
What is this key for to have him hide it in such a place?

452
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.160
What an incredible murderer.

453
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.099
The killer drowned her while her body...

454
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:48.299
was slowly being paralyzed.

455
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.069
It means that the killer watched her die.

456
00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:15.130
Thank you for letting me use the bathroom.

457
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.059
You were in there for a while.

458
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.099
Did you find something in there?

459
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400
I know, right?

460
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.930
There was nothing useful.

461
00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:26.140
My apologies for troubling you.

462
00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.269
I'm sorry you couldn't find...

463
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.309
what you were looking for.

464
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.049
Right. Are you seeing anyone?

465
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.950
- No. - Gosh, you must be lonely.

466
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.450
So that's must be why you play an instrument.

467
00:30:48.974 --> 00:30:51.874
(Episode 16 will air shortly.)
