Yoon Bok, let's get going now.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:42.634
All right.

6
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.189
Oh my goodness!

7
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.288
Are you the woman
who abandoned my daughter?

8
00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:30.725
How dare you set up a shop here

9
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:33.470
right on the road that my
daughter took to school?

10
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.476
- Mom.
- Let go of me!

11
00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.349
You!

12
00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:55.099
Were you meeting up with
this woman behind my back?

13
00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:00.341
Madam.

15
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.288
I'm going to faint.

16
00:02:04.288 --> 00:02:10.563
- Madam! Madam!
- Mom! Mom!

I'll be right back.

20
00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.793
Are you Kang Soo Jin's daughter?

21
00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.266
Yes.

22
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:49.867
What's your name?

23
00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:52.057
Kim Yoon Bok.

24
00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:03.809
I'm your grandma.

25
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.747
Grandma.

26
00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:07.957
Yeah.

27
00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.397
Mom.

28
00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:29.337
You're going to be
getting a CT scan first.

29
00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:33.275
Why did you dress your child
in such terrible clothing?

30
00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:38.022
Don't focus on anything else
but your health right now.

31
00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:41.276
It'll be bad if you get any worse today.

32
00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:42.529
All right?

33
00:03:51.723 --> 00:03:53.764
- Soo Jin.
- Mom.

34
00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:39.698
Hi, there.

35
00:04:39.698 --> 00:04:42.702
I've heard a lot about you
from your mother.

36
00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.825
Hello.

37
00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:55.647
I'm... um, well...

38
00:04:55.647 --> 00:04:58.048
I'm your mom's...
uh, how do I put this?

39
00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.986
Oh, I'm like an uncle to her.

40
00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:02.649
But you can just call me "Mister."

41
00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.436
And what's your name?

42
00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:07.219
Kim Yoon Bok.

43
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.022
How old are you?

44
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:11.561
Yoon Bok.

45
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.837
You said that you wanted
to go to the bathroom, right?

46
00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:15.075
What?

47
00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:16.782
We'll be right back.

48
00:05:27.697 --> 00:05:29.106
Listen to me carefully.

49
00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:32.188
We'll be meeting a lot of
people from now on.

50
00:05:32.188 --> 00:05:35.017
And they'll ask you tons of questions.

51
00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:38.436
Promise me that you'll answer them
in the way I tell you to.

52
00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:41.260
Your name is Kim Yoon Bok.

53
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.500
- I know.
- Seven years old.

54
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.476
I'm nine years old now, though.

55
00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.344
You're supposed to be in school
if you're nine years old.

56
00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:49.964
It'll get tricky if they ask you
which school you go to.

57
00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:51.652
Okay, then I'm seven years old.

58
00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:52.839
And you don't go to kindergarten.

59
00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.032
You said that you didn't
want to attend kindergarten

60
00:05:55.032 --> 00:05:57.301
and I told you that it was
okay if you didn't want to go.

61
00:05:57.301 --> 00:05:59.036
I hate kindergarten.

62
00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:00.620
And...

63
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.834
you've been living with me in
Mooryung since three years ago.

64
00:06:02.834 --> 00:06:05.174
Ever since I came back
from New Zealand.

65
00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:07.412
Since three years ago.

66
00:06:07.412 --> 00:06:09.003
And before that...

67
00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:11.488
My grandma raised me.

68
00:06:11.488 --> 00:06:12.926
She did?

69
00:06:13.512 --> 00:06:16.123
So you've lived with your mom
for the past three years?

70
00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:18.416
My mom came back
after my grandma passed away.

71
00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:20.404
So it's true.

72
00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:23.974
You don't know who your dad is.

73
00:06:23.974 --> 00:06:25.871
You don't know his name
or what he looks like.

74
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.508
Since you've never lived with your dad.

75
00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:29.342
I really don't know
who my real dad is.

76
00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:32.666
And...

77
00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.633
if you ever talk to someone while
I'm not around, be sure to tell me.

78
00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:39.743
So that I can make sure
that our stories match up.

79
00:06:39.743 --> 00:06:41.017
All right.

80
00:06:42.385 --> 00:06:45.597
I'm sorry for making you lie like this.

81
00:06:45.597 --> 00:06:47.584
I'm good at lying, anyway.

82
00:06:50.084 --> 00:06:52.090
So, Mom...

83
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.868
is Granny Finger your real mother?

84
00:06:58.702 --> 00:07:00.592
I think so.

85
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.666
Were you surprised?

86
00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:06.339
The curry that she made

87
00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:10.149
tasted just like the
curry that you made me.

88
00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:13.813
And you two have a similar scent
when you hug me tightly.

89
00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:52.219
Is this the kid?

90
00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:56.219
Is your kid... a boy or a girl?

91
00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:57.539
It's clear that she's a girl.

92
00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:59.094
What are you saying?

93
00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:02.431
How old are you?

94
00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:05.250
Seven years old.

95
00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:13.024
- Big Sis!
- Oh, hey!

96
00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:17.077
- What happened?
- I told you.

97
00:08:17.077 --> 00:08:20.062
I told you we had to get Big Sis away
quickly so that Mom didn't find out.

98
00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:23.987
Soo Jin, I'll really let you have it
if Mom doesn't get through this.

99
00:08:24.832 --> 00:08:26.795
It's not like Big Sis
made Mom faint on purpose!

100
00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:29.180
If there's anything you need to
come clean about, do it now

101
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.624
instead of shocking Mom into
that kind of state again later.

102
00:08:31.624 --> 00:08:32.948
Why were you hiding this kid?

103
00:08:32.948 --> 00:08:34.265
Is there some sort of problem?

104
00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:35.917
Is it about money?
Is she illegitimate?

105
00:08:35.917 --> 00:08:37.366
Hey, stop it!

106
00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:40.423
Your mother is lying in bed right now
because she's ill.

107
00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:53.736
<i>Apparently, she moved to Iceland to
study abroad before Hye Na went missing.</i>

108

Hyun Jin has work tomorrow.

119

And you need to take
the kids to kindergarten.

120
00:10:22.026 --> 00:10:24.673
You can switch off with Soo Jin
tomorrow and take care of me then.

121
00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:27.730
Should I take the kid, then?

122
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.513
I'll feed her breakfast tomorrow
and bring her back.

123
00:10:29.513 --> 00:10:32.271
No. She needs to be with me.

124
00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:34.355
Yeah.

125
00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:37.399
She'll be scared if she wakes up
tomorrow and doesn't see her mother.

126
00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:40.459
Then have some lovely family time
together, just the three of you.

127
00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:42.432
We'll get going.

128
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.689
- I'll visit you tomorrow night, Mom.
- All right.

129
00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:47.886
I'll get going now then, Madam.

130
00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:49.274
Thanks for your hard work.

131
00:10:56.773 --> 00:10:58.370
Did you get some sleep?

132
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.659
Yes.

133
00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:02.872
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

134
00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:05.254
Drive carefully.

135
00:11:05.254 --> 00:11:06.456
All right.

136
00:11:22.827 --> 00:11:24.433
So...

137
00:11:25.103 --> 00:11:27.124
since when have you been
meeting with that woman?

138
00:11:27.624 --> 00:11:29.254
It was purely coincidental...

139
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.611
that I started living in the
rooftop room above the barber shop.

140
00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:40.039
But I found out yesterday...

141
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.797
that she's my birth mother.

142
00:11:43.691 --> 00:11:45.715
It's because you wandered
around the neighborhood

143
00:11:45.715 --> 00:11:48.217
while holding that child's hand
like some sort of stray dog

144
00:11:48.217 --> 00:11:50.879
that you fell right into her trap!

145
00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:55.121
Why would you move into that rooftop
room instead of living at home?

146
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:56.241
Mom.

147
00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:58.675
Please don't get worked up.

148
00:11:58.675 --> 00:12:00.757
I'm sorry.
What I did was wrong.

149
00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:07.005
Are you upset because I hit that woman?

150
00:12:10.155 --> 00:12:11.664
I completely understand.

151
00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:18.645
So, what was her reason for doing
what she did 30 years ago?

152
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:27.720
She won't tell me.

153
00:13:04.999 --> 00:13:06.635
What is it?

154
00:13:06.635 --> 00:13:07.976
Jae Beom.

155
00:13:08.504 --> 00:13:10.314
I can't sleep.

156
00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:12.062
<i>Why not?</i>

157
00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:14.154
About the woman at Samhwa Barber Shop.

158
00:13:14.154 --> 00:13:15.938
Look into her for me.

159
00:13:17.193 --> 00:13:19.744
<i>What is it that you
want to know about her?</i>

160
00:13:19.744 --> 00:13:22.533
Why she abandoned my Soo Jin.

161
00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:28.153
Nothing will change
just because you find that out.

162
00:13:28.712 --> 00:13:33.222
<i>Soo Jin is your daughter
whom you've raised for the past 30 years.</i>

163
00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:35.922
<i>And now, Soo Jin has brought
her own daughter to you</i>

164

<i>and is standing before you right now.</i>

165

Can't you just ignore that woman

166
00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:42.679
and focus solely on your treatment?

167
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:45.884
I feel like my brain has
become affected, too.

168
00:13:45.884 --> 00:13:48.607
Wouldn't it be unfair if I died
without ever finding out the reason

169
00:13:48.607 --> 00:13:50.900
when I've been curious
about this for the past 30 years?

170
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.193
Look into where she lived,
what kind of woman she is

171
00:13:53.193 --> 00:13:56.529
how she gave birth to and raised my
Soo Jin, why she abandoned her

172
00:13:56.529 --> 00:14:00.924
and why she came to our neighborhood
and set up a barber shop.

173

<i>A long time ago</i>

174

175
00:14:07.068 --> 00:14:08.891
<i>you remember what I did, right?</i>

176
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:11.939
I called her out in front of her parents,
but I was just getting started.

177
00:14:11.939 --> 00:14:14.361
I went to the cram school
and gym she went to

178
00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:17.110
and even went to the hair salon
that she frequented.

179
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.596
Oh yeah, and that car.

180
00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:20.385
Remember that car?

181
00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:22.536
Apparently, I'd bought her a car
with my own money.

182
00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:25.905
That jerk of a husband used
our company credit card

183
00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:28.948
to buy that 22-year-old a convertible.

184
00:14:28.948 --> 00:14:30.808
<i>Well, it was mine anyway</i>

185
00:14:30.808 --> 00:14:34.406
<i>so I crashed it into a wall
and destroyed it.</i>

186
00:14:35.126 --> 00:14:38.525
But I don't think doing that will be
anywhere close to enough to calm me down.

You understand what I'm saying, right?

188

Why are there so many of
these cases as of late?

202
00:15:43.948 --> 00:15:45.404
Because our society
is getting tougher to survive in.

203
00:15:45.404 --> 00:15:49.429
The stress that society is experiencing
is trickling down to everyone

204
00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:52.331
and is affecting those at
the very bottom: young, weak kids.

205
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:56.610
There are many cases in which
the perpetrator is the child's mother.

206
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.659
And seeing as how that's the case

207
00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:00.528
the level of stress that
mothers feel in society

208
00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:02.861

Even if the tumor may be this small

250
00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:28.017
there is very little space
inside of our brains

251

Don't most people go to hear that
kind of news with their family?

They're my private matters.

295
00:21:18.242 --> 00:21:22.083
Something like a really difficult
math problem that nobody could solve

296

I wanted to go somewhere

So I read a lot of books.

310

A different kid.

321
00:24:20.715 --> 00:24:22.955
I'd like it if I could be a boy.

322
00:24:22.955 --> 00:24:25.240
One that is okay with being a bit dirty

323
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.064
and doesn't cry even when he's in pain.

324
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:48.071
A question.

325
00:24:48.071 --> 00:24:54.088
Do you hate Granny Finger,
or do you want to see her?

326
00:25:01.884 --> 00:25:03.269
I hate her.

327
00:25:05.002 --> 00:25:06.939
I hate her quite a lot.

328
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:10.733
To be honest, I don't think
I'll be able to forgive her.

329
00:25:14.355 --> 00:25:16.030
But...

330
00:25:19.797 --> 00:25:21.650
I wanted to see her.

331
00:25:22.113 --> 00:25:23.547
For a long time.

332
00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:28.122
And I think I still do.

333
00:25:28.967 --> 00:25:31.615
You hate her,
and yet you want to see her?

334
00:26:03.554 --> 00:26:05.025
Do you...

335
00:26:07.453 --> 00:26:09.330
miss your mom?

336
00:26:32.407 --> 00:26:34.601
Is this the end?

337
00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:36.745
Is this the key?

338
00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:46.555
<i>Wow, the lady from the barber shop
is a lot scarier than she seems.</i>

339
00:27:46.555 --> 00:27:47.973
<i>She has a criminal history.</i>

340
00:27:47.973 --> 00:27:49.110
Go on.

341
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.554
<i>Murder.</i>

342
00:27:52.344 --> 00:27:55.351
<i>She was sentenced to eight years
but served six years.</i>

343
00:27:55.351 --> 00:27:56.400
Who did she kill?

344
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.897
<i>The man she lived with.</i>

345
00:27:57.897 --> 00:27:59.102
Geez.

346
00:27:59.102 --> 00:28:00.328
Why did she do that?

347
00:28:00.328 --> 00:28:02.456
<i>I've been looking through
the court records</i>

348
00:28:02.456 --> 00:28:05.236
<i>but she wouldn't say anything
about it all throughout the trial.</i>

349
00:28:05.236 --> 00:28:07.167
Keep looking into it.

350
00:28:07.167 --> 00:28:09.321
And meet with the attorney, too.

351
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:12.878
<i>[The Story of a Happy Mooryung Mom]</i>

352
00:28:12.878 --> 00:28:16.200
You know how a nine-year-old girl went
missing in Mooryung not too long ago?

353
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.245
Yeah.

354
00:28:17.245 --> 00:28:22.142
It appeared that the child was
playing alone and fell into the harbor

355
00:28:22.142 --> 00:28:25.069
but things weren't looking good
since they couldn't find a body

356
00:28:25.069 --> 00:28:28.237
so they suddenly arrested
the mother of the child.

357
00:28:28.237 --> 00:28:31.066
Was the mother involved somehow?

358
00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:33.925
Her mother won't pick up
the phone right now

359
00:28:33.925 --> 00:28:37.158
but I'll visit Mooryung this evening.

360
00:28:48.684 --> 00:28:51.376
We should know each others'
phone numbers, since we're family.

361
00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:53.377
It's not like you pick up
our house phone, anyway.

362
00:28:54.056 --> 00:28:55.364
You called?

363
00:28:55.364 --> 00:28:56.715
Mom.

364
00:28:56.715 --> 00:29:00.177
Is that a girl or a boy?

365
00:29:00.852 --> 00:29:02.446
She looks like a boy, right?

366
00:29:02.446 --> 00:29:03.867
But she's a girl.

367
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:06.038
And she's the same age
as you, so you can be friends.

368
00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:08.676
Hi.

369
00:29:11.388 --> 00:29:12.619
What is it?

370
00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:16.295
Mom told me to take Yoon Bok
to the salon and the department store.

371
00:29:16.295 --> 00:29:17.360
No thanks.

372
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.357
Why are you saying that now
when I'm already here and willing?

373
00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:25.381
- What is this?
- It's not for you.

374
00:29:25.381 --> 00:29:28.751
I give this to my kids.
You should feed it to Yoon Bok, too.

375
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:40.503
Thank you very much.

376
00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:43.239
May I eat it now?

377
00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.344
It tastes good.

378
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:05.298
Wow, this room looks
exactly the same as it used to.

379
00:30:05.298 --> 00:30:07.195
Not a single thing about it has changed.

380
00:30:07.195 --> 00:30:08.532
Mom.

381
00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:13.306
Is she wearing clothes like that
because she's poor?

382
00:30:15.425 --> 00:30:16.725
Tae Mi!

383
00:30:16.725 --> 00:30:19.589
If a friend of yours is pitiful,
you should be nice to them.

384
00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:22.089
Go over there right now
and play with her.

385
00:30:22.727 --> 00:30:25.011
She's not wearing clothes
like these because she's poor.

386
00:30:25.011 --> 00:30:27.413
She's wearing these sorts of clothes
because she likes them.

387
00:30:27.413 --> 00:30:30.078
Yoon Bok doesn't like
lace or pink things.

388
00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:33.036
Why are you being like that?
She's just a child.

389
00:30:33.036 --> 00:30:36.117
We won't go to the salon or the
department store, so leave now.

390
00:30:36.117 --> 00:30:38.080
You're so weird, seriously.

391
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.235
Why are you trying to raise
the kid to be like you?

392
00:30:40.235 --> 00:30:43.426
What kind of girl likes those kinds
of clothes? That's just what you think.

393
00:30:43.426 --> 00:30:45.894
I'll go, Mom.

394
00:30:46.726 --> 00:30:48.093
Huh?

395
00:30:48.093 --> 00:30:50.698
I'll go to the department store.

396
00:30:50.698 --> 00:30:52.158
With my friend.

397
00:30:56.199 --> 00:30:57.804
<i>Doctor.</i>

398
00:30:57.804 --> 00:31:00.665
When I first got cancer seven years ago

399
00:31:00.665 --> 00:31:03.016
I got surgery, had chemotherapy

400
00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:05.671
and got radiation therapy
to get this far.

401
00:31:05.671 --> 00:31:09.932
But right now, I feel more
motivated than ever before.

402
00:31:09.932 --> 00:31:11.458
Oh, is that so?

403
00:31:11.458 --> 00:31:12.545
That's a relief.

404
00:31:12.545 --> 00:31:17.259
Please tell me about my body's
current state in greater detail.

405
00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:18.457
For example...

406
00:31:18.457 --> 00:31:20.352
what is the probability
that I'll live to see

407
00:31:20.352 --> 00:31:24.595
a child who is seven years old now
enter college?

409
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.341
<i>I told you this before</i>

410
00:31:40.341 --> 00:31:43.208
but people's lives are
not dictated by probability

411
00:31:43.208 --> 00:31:44.907
but life itself.

412
00:31:44.907 --> 00:31:47.104
Tell me in terms of numbers today.

413
00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:56.969
10... percent.

414
00:32:01.158 --> 00:32:03.498
It's just as I thought.

415
00:32:04.826 --> 00:32:07.728
But still, I'll try everything.

416
00:32:08.357 --> 00:32:10.431
I'll stop doing anything else

417
00:32:10.431 --> 00:32:12.857
and I plan to focus
solely on my treatments.

418
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:17.312
Thank you for everything
up until now, Doctor.

419
00:32:17.312 --> 00:32:18.403
For what?

420
00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:20.839
You suffered quite a bit because
of a disobedient patient like me.

421
00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:24.300
Nobody can easily come to terms with
the fact that they're a cancer patient.

422
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.901
But...

423
00:32:25.901 --> 00:32:28.740
I'd like to have a different attending
physician from this point onward.

424
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.295
- What?
- You'll be retiring soon, after all.

425
00:32:31.295 --> 00:32:34.425
My objective is to survive
for the next 12 years.

426
00:32:34.425 --> 00:32:37.399
Until a seven-year-old child
enters university?

427
00:32:37.399 --> 00:32:38.594
Yes.

428
00:32:39.485 --> 00:32:43.942
I'd like for them to be someone who will
aggressively defend me until then.

429
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.023
And the most important thing is...

430
00:32:49.853 --> 00:32:53.471
that there is a 90 percent chance
that I may not survive.

431
00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:57.780
I'd like for my new
physician to be someone...

432
00:32:59.282 --> 00:33:04.721
who can be a source of strength
for my family if I do end up dying.

Oh, my pretty little pup.

00:33:44.656 --> 00:33:46.796
You bought new clothes, huh?
How pretty!

What about Big Sis?

Oh.

447
00:34:00.798 --> 00:34:02.008
All right.

448
00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:04.405
Come here, Yoon Bok.

449
00:34:24.901 --> 00:34:27.280
Look at this, Grandma!

450
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.852
I bought new shoes, too!

451
00:34:28.852 --> 00:34:30.137
Look at the back!

452
00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:31.981
Don't they look like my mom's shoes?

453
00:34:31.981 --> 00:34:33.829
Ah, yes. How pretty.

454
00:34:34.726 --> 00:34:37.095
Wow, they even have
sparkles on them!

455
00:34:38.052 --> 00:34:40.967
It almost feels like I'm looking at
Soo Jin when she was young.

456
00:34:42.144 --> 00:34:43.539
No way.

457
00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:46.852
Her eyes, nose, mouth, forehead,
chin, and skin tone

458
00:34:46.852 --> 00:34:48.840
don't look anything
like Big Sis's, at all.

459
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.371
She either takes after
her father completely

460
00:34:50.371 --> 00:34:52.519
or she's not Big Sis's
biological daughter.

Yoon Bok.

462
00:34:53.747 --> 00:34:55.751
Do you take after your father?

463
00:34:58.849 --> 00:35:00.005
Yes.

464
00:35:00.005 --> 00:35:01.157
Yi Jin.

465
00:35:01.707 --> 00:35:04.303
I raised three daughters,
all with different fathers

466
00:35:04.303 --> 00:35:07.059
and taught them that it doesn't
matter who one's father is.

467
00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:10.398
I told you to only remember the fact
that you three are my daughters.

468
00:35:10.398 --> 00:35:13.727
And among you three is a child
I didn't give birth to myself.

469
00:35:13.727 --> 00:35:16.325
But all three of you
are my real daughters.

470
00:35:16.325 --> 00:35:18.986
If I raised you, you're my real daughter.

471
00:35:19.832 --> 00:35:23.313
If you ever speak that way to Yoon Bok
again, I will be quite angry. Got it?

472
00:35:23.313 --> 00:35:24.530
Got it?

473
00:35:25.988 --> 00:35:27.430
Um... yes.

474
00:35:28.412 --> 00:35:30.704
All right, kids! Come here!

475
00:35:30.704 --> 00:35:31.988
Come over here.

476
00:35:33.486 --> 00:35:35.207
Do you want some warm hot chocolate?

477
00:35:35.207 --> 00:35:37.084
Or do you want juice?
Or strawberry milk?

478
00:35:37.084 --> 00:35:38.124
Strawberry milk!

479
00:35:38.124 --> 00:35:39.517
Strawberry milk.

480
00:35:39.517 --> 00:35:40.842
Hot chocolate.

481
00:35:40.842 --> 00:35:41.907
Hot chocolate!

482
00:35:42.595 --> 00:35:43.874
Want me to open it for you?

483
00:35:43.874 --> 00:35:44.874
Yes.

484
00:35:48.727 --> 00:35:50.220
Here, you have some.

485
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:54.778
Are you all right?

486
00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:57.010
Lift up your hands!

487
00:35:59.329 --> 00:36:00.365
Huh?

488
00:36:00.365 --> 00:36:02.523
You have a purple birthmark?

489
00:36:02.523 --> 00:36:03.831
Yes.

490
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:07.140
Whoosh!

491
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.760
All right, then.

492
00:36:09.521 --> 00:36:11.939
What shall we have you wear?

493
00:36:12.909 --> 00:36:15.213
I want to wear my own clothes.

494
00:36:15.213 --> 00:36:17.479
Why? You have tons of
new clothes, though.

495
00:36:18.026 --> 00:36:20.155
I like my own clothes more.

496
00:36:25.023 --> 00:36:27.336
The guardian of Kang Young Shin?

497
00:36:27.336 --> 00:36:29.450
Please go into Room Two.

498
00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:37.428
I thought I'd be meeting
with Professor Baek

499
00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:39.758
since I was supposed to meet
her attending physician.

500
00:36:40.644 --> 00:36:42.996
I received a call this afternoon
from Madam Cha

501
00:36:42.996 --> 00:36:45.238
and she asked me to be
her new attending physician.

502
00:36:53.901 --> 00:36:55.872
At first, I refused.

503
00:36:55.872 --> 00:36:59.269
After all, Professor Baek is the best
specialist for breast cancer in Korea

504
00:36:59.269 --> 00:37:02.704
and it's only been two years
since I finished my fellowship.

505
00:37:02.704 --> 00:37:06.137
But after I heard what
Madam Cha had to say

506
00:37:06.787 --> 00:37:09.916
it didn't seem that she wanted to change
her physician due to her treatments.

507
00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:11.820
Then... why?

508
00:37:13.693 --> 00:37:15.881
I think it's because of you, Soo Jin.

509
00:37:15.881 --> 00:37:17.008
What?

510
00:37:18.956 --> 00:37:20.954
My mother underwent surgery...

511
00:37:22.046 --> 00:37:26.557
for breast cancer at this hospital
in the same year that Madam Cha did.

512
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:33.494
She used to talk quite a lot with
Madam Cha until late into the night.

513
00:37:36.747 --> 00:37:38.876
After looking at her chart

514
00:37:38.876 --> 00:37:42.331
I think I know why she asked me
to be her attending physician.

515
00:37:44.447 --> 00:37:47.421
On days like this, when the
patient's condition worsens

516
00:37:47.421 --> 00:37:51.592
and when the doctor needs to relay
that information to the family...

517
00:37:52.624 --> 00:37:56.731
and in the more painful and difficult
moments that are to come later...

518
00:37:58.363 --> 00:38:01.374
she wants me to be your
strength, is what I think.

519
00:38:20.867 --> 00:38:23.180
You've been watching me
for a while now, right?

520
00:38:23.771 --> 00:38:24.934
Um, yes.

521
00:38:24.934 --> 00:38:28.530
If there's anything you want to know,
don't suffer out here in the cold.

522
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.985
Rather, come inside
and ask me yourself.

523
00:38:31.986 --> 00:38:33.215
You mean, in there?

524
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.003
I just wanted to feel her presence
from a distance

525
00:38:45.003 --> 00:38:47.052
even though I lived here.

526
00:38:47.775 --> 00:38:52.258
I don't even have the smallest desire
to be acknowledged as Soo Jin's mother.

527
00:38:52.258 --> 00:38:54.224
Not at all.

528
00:38:55.999 --> 00:38:57.689
I know that this is
shameless of me to ask

529
00:38:57.689 --> 00:38:59.849
but if you can be understanding
of my predicament

530
00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:02.198
I'll live here quietly
as if I were dead

531
00:39:02.198 --> 00:39:05.773
until the day I truly die.

532
00:39:11.534 --> 00:39:14.702
Well, um, the thing is...

533
00:39:14.702 --> 00:39:19.178
I don't think we will be able
to be understanding of that.

534
00:39:19.178 --> 00:39:23.043
We will give you the money
for any relevant costs

535
00:39:23.043 --> 00:39:26.657
so please, move elsewhere.

536
00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:32.613
Of course, we do realize...

537
00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:37.564
that it will be quite difficult
for you if you move.

538
00:39:37.564 --> 00:39:39.003
However...

539
00:39:39.552 --> 00:39:42.218
it won't...

540
00:39:42.918 --> 00:39:44.642
kill you, correct?

541
00:39:45.659 --> 00:39:48.398
But right now, such isn't
the case for Ms. Cha.

542
00:39:48.398 --> 00:39:51.401
Um... you do understand...

543
00:39:52.032 --> 00:39:53.803
what I'm trying to get at, correct?

544
00:39:57.235 --> 00:39:59.907
I will pack my things.

545
00:39:59.907 --> 00:40:01.675
Please give me some time.

546
00:40:01.675 --> 00:40:04.124
Yes, well, then...

547
00:40:04.807 --> 00:40:06.965
please do that.

548
00:40:06.965 --> 00:40:10.407
Um, one more thing.

549
00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:14.590
There is one thing that Ms. Cha
dearly wishes to know.

550
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:16.485
- What is it?
- Well...

551
00:40:16.485 --> 00:40:18.633
How do I put this?

552
00:40:18.633 --> 00:40:19.825
Um...

553
00:40:19.825 --> 00:40:22.334
- Why did you...
- abandon Soo Jin?

554
00:40:29.476 --> 00:40:34.157
I put everything on the line...

555
00:40:35.217 --> 00:40:37.816
to ensure that she'd grow up
without ever finding out anything.

556
00:40:37.816 --> 00:40:41.072
But if she were to find out
the reason for that now...

557
00:40:41.682 --> 00:40:43.822
the many years
that I've lived like this...

558
00:40:44.383 --> 00:40:46.003
will be rendered useless.

559
00:40:47.526 --> 00:40:50.700
That is the one thing that I ask you
not to pry any further into.

560
00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:11.240
You're back?

561
00:41:11.847 --> 00:41:13.447
You weren't asleep?

562
00:41:16.102 --> 00:41:17.361
I'll take Yoon Bok and go.

563
00:41:17.361 --> 00:41:19.338
No, let her sleep.

564
00:41:22.448 --> 00:41:24.025
Soo Jin.

565
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.985
I'm just so happy right now.

566
00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:32.218
Never in my wildest dreams did I ever
think that you'd give me a granddaughter.

567
00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:38.093
Some people feel assured
if they have a lot of cash

568
00:41:38.093 --> 00:41:41.235
while others feel at ease
if they own a lot of property.

569
00:41:42.517 --> 00:41:44.878
But I need children.

570
00:41:46.005 --> 00:41:48.666
Children are the future,
and children are everything.

571
00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:54.510
The doctors are all saying
that I will die soon.

572
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:56.907
But that's not important

573
00:41:56.907 --> 00:42:00.046
when my granddaughter is
sleeping beside me right now.

574
00:42:04.334 --> 00:42:06.544
When I get a bit better...

575
00:42:07.003 --> 00:42:08.901
you will probably leave me.

576
00:42:11.525 --> 00:42:12.999
Fine, go.

577
00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:15.758
I won't ask you to stay.

578
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:17.760
But...

579
00:42:18.604 --> 00:42:20.564
leave Yoon Bok here and go.

580
00:42:21.854 --> 00:42:23.784
How will you manage to raise
Yoon Bok alone

581
00:42:23.784 --> 00:42:26.015
in that faraway place, anyway...

582
00:42:27.032 --> 00:42:29.332
when you're studying, or
working, or whatever else?

583
00:42:31.506 --> 00:42:33.403
What are you saying, Mom?

584
00:42:33.403 --> 00:42:34.963
You want me to leave her behind?

585
00:42:34.963 --> 00:42:38.642
Yoon Bok told me that her grandmother
raised her when she was young.

586
00:42:39.285 --> 00:42:41.376
I'll be good at raising her, too.

587
00:42:42.403 --> 00:42:44.968
I was so busy when I was
raising you girls

588
00:42:44.968 --> 00:42:47.242
so I couldn't do everything
that I wanted to do for you.

589
00:42:47.242 --> 00:42:50.751
But I can do a fantastic job
of it now, Soo Jin.

590
00:42:51.749 --> 00:42:53.188
So go out there

591
00:42:53.188 --> 00:42:55.260
and chase your dreams
to your heart's content.

592
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.128
And you can come back
once a year or so to visit.

593
00:42:58.128 --> 00:42:59.992
Couldn't you?

594
00:43:05.517 --> 00:43:06.702
Yes.

595
00:43:06.702 --> 00:43:08.572
I'm on my way to Mooryung
right now, Senior.

596
00:43:08.572 --> 00:43:10.512
- So you're going to interview her?
- <i>Yes.</i>

597
00:43:10.512 --> 00:43:12.579
I watched the news coverage
about her disappearance

598
00:43:12.579 --> 00:43:15.698
but there are witnesses too,
so I think she did fall into the ocean.

599
00:43:15.698 --> 00:43:17.081
<i>Call me when you're done.</i>

600
00:43:17.081 --> 00:43:18.204
All right.

601
00:43:25.081 --> 00:43:27.872
<i>She is about 110 centimeters tall,
and weighs about 20 kilograms.</i>

602
00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:31.188
<i>She has a purple birthmark the size of
a fingernail near her left underarm.</i>

603
00:43:31.188 --> 00:43:35.840
<i>She was last seen wearing a red coat,
jeans, and yellow sneakers.</i>

604
00:43:36.392 --> 00:43:38.671
Huh? You have a purple birthmark?

605
00:43:39.218 --> 00:43:40.354
Yes.

606
00:43:40.354 --> 00:43:44.552
<i>And one of her sneakers has
already been found in the ocean.</i>

607
00:44:00.994 --> 00:44:02.483
Is she asleep?

608
00:44:04.597 --> 00:44:06.775
Geez.

609
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:09.046
Today must have been rough for you.

610
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.347
Why don't you go on a little walk?

611
00:44:13.347 --> 00:44:14.611
All right.

612
00:44:24.323 --> 00:44:25.945
Mister.

613
00:44:26.861 --> 00:44:27.861
Yeah?

614
00:44:28.588 --> 00:44:30.695
Where did you go?

615
00:44:31.421 --> 00:44:32.604
Well...

616
00:44:33.459 --> 00:44:35.773
I had... some business
to take care of.

617
00:44:36.456 --> 00:44:37.599
Why?

618
00:44:38.081 --> 00:44:39.671
It just strikes me as odd, is all.

619
00:44:40.275 --> 00:44:44.291
What other business could you be
attending to, when Mom is hospitalized?

620
00:44:44.838 --> 00:44:46.948
You're the type who'd probably
stick around all day

621
00:44:46.948 --> 00:44:49.646
even if Mom tried to force
you to do something else.

622
00:44:52.807 --> 00:44:54.097
Did you...

623
00:44:55.802 --> 00:44:57.403
meet with her?

624
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:06.200
Welcome.

625
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.119
Take a seat.

626
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:09.581
I'm...

627
00:45:10.086 --> 00:45:12.468
Ms. Cha Young Shin's
attending physician.

628
00:45:20.762 --> 00:45:22.079
Yoon Bok...

629
00:45:22.747 --> 00:45:24.561
wanted me to give you this, ma'am.

630
00:45:27.854 --> 00:45:31.715
<i>Are you all right, Granny?
I was worried about you.</i>

631
00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:44.003
Get a haircut before you go.

632
00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.168
<i>Did Mom send you over there?</i>

633
00:46:09.184 --> 00:46:10.240
Why?

634
00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.903
What did she want you to tell her?

635
00:46:12.537 --> 00:46:15.555
I think your mom has the right.

636
00:46:15.555 --> 00:46:16.640
Um...

637
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.255
the right to try and know
what kind of person she is.

638
00:46:19.255 --> 00:46:22.726
And the right to express her emotions
about this current situation.

639
00:46:25.148 --> 00:46:26.702
You didn't...

640
00:46:27.854 --> 00:46:29.675
go there to get rid of her, did you?

641
00:46:29.675 --> 00:46:30.677
Soo Jin.

642
00:46:30.677 --> 00:46:32.561
Focus only on worrying about
your mom right now.

643
00:46:32.561 --> 00:46:33.666
Did you do it?

644
00:46:35.334 --> 00:46:36.784
No.

645
00:46:36.784 --> 00:46:38.794
She's not that kind of person.

646
00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.066
Back when I was in school

647
00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:45.079
all of the kids that used to tease me
all left to study abroad, one by one.

648
00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:47.845
Don't play dumb, Mister.

649
00:46:47.845 --> 00:46:48.932
Well...

650
00:46:48.932 --> 00:46:51.378
they were kids who teased you
since you didn't have a dad

651
00:46:51.378 --> 00:46:53.034
and said your mother was
a fake mom, all right?

652
00:46:53.034 --> 00:46:55.307
So, do you know what I did?

653
00:46:56.108 --> 00:46:59.052
I visited each and every one
of them and apologized.

654
00:46:59.052 --> 00:47:01.749
Whether they accepted
my apology or not.

655
00:47:03.034 --> 00:47:05.856
I have no interest
in that person whatsoever.

656
00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:08.523
And I never want to see her again.

657
00:47:10.057 --> 00:47:12.090
As long as Mom doesn't do anything...

658
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:15.108
I will never see her again.

659
00:47:32.032 --> 00:47:35.496
<i>"The rose of Sharon has bloomed."</i>

660
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.258
<i>"The rose of Sharon has bloomed."</i>

661
00:47:56.697 --> 00:48:00.184
<i>"The rose of Sharon has bloomed."</i>

662
00:48:00.936 --> 00:48:02.401
<i>"The rose of Sharon..."</i>

663
00:48:02.401 --> 00:48:07.334
<i>You were a child who
didn't cry, Soo Jin.</i>

664
00:48:07.334 --> 00:48:10.017
<i>Even though it probably
would've made you feel better</i>

665
00:48:10.017 --> 00:48:12.521
<i>to cry, even just once.</i>

666
00:48:13.749 --> 00:48:18.369
<i>You seemed to have decided that you
weren't going to cry until your mom came.</i>

667
00:48:18.961 --> 00:48:23.697
<i>Was it that you were only able to
live your life if I disappeared, ma'am?</i>

668
00:48:24.912 --> 00:48:27.479
<i>You... remember?</i>

669
00:48:27.479 --> 00:48:29.668
<i>Was your life difficult because of me?</i>

670
00:48:29.668 --> 00:48:32.159
<i>The things that happened on that day...</i>

671
00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:36.376
<i>Soo Jin.</i>

672
00:48:37.854 --> 00:48:40.169
Shall the two of us...

673
00:48:40.169 --> 00:48:42.836
follow those birds...

674
00:48:42.836 --> 00:48:44.376
and, step...

675
00:48:45.235 --> 00:48:47.053
by step...

676
00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:49.876
walk into the ocean together?

677
00:48:52.747 --> 00:48:54.686
I don't want to, though.

678
00:48:54.686 --> 00:48:56.599
Go in the water
by yourself, Mom.

679
00:48:56.599 --> 00:48:59.101
I want to live.

680
00:49:02.881 --> 00:49:04.115
Ms. Soo Jin.

681
00:49:10.137 --> 00:49:11.977
What's the matter?

682
00:49:13.624 --> 00:49:15.061
It's nothing.

683
00:49:17.331 --> 00:49:20.611
I just remembered something
that I'd forgotten.

684
00:49:22.081 --> 00:49:24.784
But I don't know whether
it actually happened...

685
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.050
or it's just something
that my mind made up.

686
00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:37.648
On November 10th, 1986

687
00:49:37.648 --> 00:49:40.939
on the day before Soo Jin was
discovered at the orphanage

688
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:43.488
she turned herself in
at the police station.

689
00:49:43.488 --> 00:49:46.794
And according to the court records

690
00:49:46.794 --> 00:49:50.193
she didn't say anything
throughout the entire trial.

691
00:49:50.193 --> 00:49:51.662
And even the public defender
assigned to her

692
00:49:51.662 --> 00:49:53.369
just used the facts of the situation

693
00:49:53.369 --> 00:49:54.967
in order to defend her.

694
00:49:56.131 --> 00:49:58.883
Her man must have been
a real son of a bitch.

695
00:50:00.771 --> 00:50:04.432
And she didn't want people to call
her daughter a murderer's daughter...

696
00:50:04.959 --> 00:50:07.343
so she abandoned her child
where nobody could find her.

697
00:50:07.343 --> 00:50:09.769
Um, according to her...

698
00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:14.188
she wanted Soo Jin to
remain unaware of this...

699
00:50:14.689 --> 00:50:16.284
Let's keep this a secret.

700
00:50:17.169 --> 00:50:18.396
Madam.

701
00:50:19.122 --> 00:50:21.236
Um, the thing about
Soo Jin is...

702
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.472
she thinks her biological mother
abandoned her after abusing her.

703
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.099
So wouldn't it be better
for her to know the truth?

704
00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:33.534
If I were her mother, I wouldn't want
Soo Jin to know about this, either.

705
00:50:34.753 --> 00:50:37.323
The only memory that I am sure of...

706
00:50:39.626 --> 00:50:41.014
is red bean bread.

707
00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.412
My mom told me that she'd be back
if I ate it slowly.

708
00:50:47.075 --> 00:50:49.631
So I ate it really, really slowly.

709
00:50:53.675 --> 00:50:57.008
<i>I ate more than half of it
but my mom still wasn't back...</i>

710
00:50:59.604 --> 00:51:03.197
<i>so I tried to take
much smaller bites.</i>

711
00:51:03.892 --> 00:51:06.494
<i>I think I realized around that point...</i>

712
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.593
<i>that my mom...</i>

713
00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:12.501
<i>wasn't coming.</i>

714
00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:21.396
I feel like I may have even
known that from the very start.

715
00:51:24.026 --> 00:51:26.666
From the moment that she
locked me to that fence...

716
00:51:28.275 --> 00:51:31.075
I felt that day was different
from other days.

717
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.829
But all I could do...

718
00:51:38.769 --> 00:51:42.396
was eat that red bean bread slowly.

719
00:51:43.151 --> 00:51:44.796
<i>So I tried so hard...</i>

720
00:51:46.197 --> 00:51:49.238
<i>to take smaller and smaller bites...</i>

721
00:51:51.084 --> 00:51:53.729
<i>but I couldn't take
any more small bites.</i>

722
00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:57.813
<i>I think that's when I started crying.</i>

723
00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:03.311
<i>I could only continue
to wait for my mom...</i>

724
00:52:04.506 --> 00:52:07.146
<i>if I could continue
taking bites out of it.</i>

725
00:52:11.255 --> 00:52:13.070
So you kept waiting for her.

726
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.872
From then, up until now.

727
00:52:16.523 --> 00:52:18.010
But...

728
00:52:20.497 --> 00:52:23.639
today, I recalled a memory
that I'd forgotten.

729
00:52:25.573 --> 00:52:28.220
My mom, who I'd waited so long for...

730
00:52:30.305 --> 00:52:32.709
tried to kill me.

731
00:52:37.916 --> 00:52:39.251
I'm angry.

732
00:52:42.189 --> 00:52:44.744
I'm so angry that I don't
know what to do with myself.

733
00:52:45.311 --> 00:52:47.845
The person who loved me so much
that I felt as if I'd suffocate

734
00:52:47.845 --> 00:52:49.684
is dying right before my eyes.

735
00:52:50.347 --> 00:52:51.494
And my child...

736
00:52:52.171 --> 00:52:54.635
I have to hurry and take her,
and leave this place, but...

737
00:53:17.827 --> 00:53:21.416
I bet your heart rate
is around 130 bpm right now.

738
00:53:21.416 --> 00:53:24.782
But the average adult's heart rate
is between 60 to 100.

739
00:53:24.782 --> 00:53:27.956
So that means that you are
quite stressed out right now.

740
00:53:28.814 --> 00:53:29.916
So?

741
00:53:29.916 --> 00:53:31.642
Drink plenty of water.

742
00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:34.131
Around 8 to 10 cups per day.

743
00:53:34.131 --> 00:53:35.784
Make sure you feed yourself properly.

744
00:53:35.784 --> 00:53:37.407
Also, sleep is quite important.

745
00:53:37.407 --> 00:53:39.559
People slowly recover
while they're sleeping.

746
00:53:39.559 --> 00:53:42.573
So you have to be sure to move
as little as possible right now.

747
00:53:43.082 --> 00:53:45.700
Your instincts will be of help to you.

748
00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:49.535
Just as birds go to
a dark, secluded place

749
00:53:49.535 --> 00:53:50.994
and sit tight when they're injured.

750
00:53:52.436 --> 00:53:55.465
Also, which number
do emergency patients call?

751
00:53:56.889 --> 00:53:58.160
911?

752
00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.842
As for you, you should call me.

753
00:53:59.842 --> 00:54:02.900
Don't think about anything else
and just automatically call me.

754
00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:05.390
I'm your 911.

755
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:07.186
All right?

756
00:54:10.811 --> 00:54:12.985
So, what did that woman say she'd do?

757
00:54:12.985 --> 00:54:14.097
Oh, well...

758
00:54:14.097 --> 00:54:15.693
she said that she'd move.

759
00:54:15.693 --> 00:54:18.050
Get her out of there
as soon as possible.

760
00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.472
So that I won't ever
see her again before I die.

761
00:54:22.168 --> 00:54:25.372
Seeing her together with
Soo Jin made my blood boil.

762
00:54:25.928 --> 00:54:28.938
Those two look so alike, don't you think?

763
00:54:30.323 --> 00:54:33.349
I don't care what they do
after I die...

764
00:54:34.327 --> 00:54:37.302
but I want to breathe my last breath
as Soo Jin's only mother.

765
00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.481
<i>I'm sure that the person
who abandoned Soo Jin</i>

766
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:47.740
<i>had her own reasons for doing so.</i>

767
00:54:49.735 --> 00:54:53.640
<i>But when I think about what state my
child was in when she was abandoned...</i>

768
00:54:54.294 --> 00:54:57.488
<i>my desire to be understanding of
her situation completely vanishes.</i>

769
00:54:57.488 --> 00:55:00.459
<i>There were scars all over my child's body</i>

770
00:55:00.459 --> 00:55:02.459
<i>and there was a lock on her...</i>

771
00:55:02.887 --> 00:55:04.963
<i>to prevent her from running away.</i>

772
00:55:06.195 --> 00:55:09.380
<i>The only situation that
I'd be understanding of...</i>

773
00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.869
<i>was if...</i>

774
00:55:11.669 --> 00:55:13.421
<i>her mother had died.</i>

775
00:55:19.999 --> 00:55:21.488
I'll be heading home now.

776
00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:27.452
Please give this to Yoon Bok.

777
00:55:28.852 --> 00:55:32.838
How did you know that
Yoon Bok likes this?

778
00:55:37.217 --> 00:55:40.146
<i>[I'm okay, Yoon Bok. Thank you.]</i>

779
00:55:45.427 --> 00:55:47.447
You got a haircut, I see.

780
00:55:48.064 --> 00:55:49.264
Oh.

781
00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.782
Was she...

782
00:55:53.782 --> 00:55:55.318
doing okay?

783
00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:57.372
She seemed to be quite
a resilient person.

784
00:55:57.372 --> 00:55:59.479
She cut my hair
without a single word.

785
00:55:59.479 --> 00:56:01.282
And asked me to take
good care of Madam Cha.

786
00:56:03.747 --> 00:56:05.860
She's really good at cutting men's hair.

787
00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.427
This part right here
always pops up a bit.

788
00:56:08.427 --> 00:56:10.342
And it always gave me
a bit of trouble, but...

789
00:56:13.537 --> 00:56:16.610
I finally found a barber shop
that I really liked...

790
00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:19.186
but she said that
she'll be moving soon.

791
00:56:19.186 --> 00:56:21.300
She was packing her things.

792
00:56:38.325 --> 00:56:40.343
Did you tell her to leave?

793
00:56:40.941 --> 00:56:43.260
Um, that's not it.

794
00:56:43.682 --> 00:56:44.887
I did.

795
00:56:45.476 --> 00:56:48.217
She's been working there
for 27 years now.

796
00:56:48.769 --> 00:56:51.467
You can't just kick her out
like that because you don't like her.

797
00:56:51.467 --> 00:56:54.284
It's not like it was purely coincidental
that she was living there.

798
00:56:54.284 --> 00:56:57.461
She strategically moved there,
knowing that you were nearby.

799
00:56:57.461 --> 00:56:59.197
So why can't I kick her out?

800
00:56:59.197 --> 00:57:01.039
She has nothing to do with us.

801
00:57:01.039 --> 00:57:03.367
- And she's done nothing wrong to us...
- Yes, she has.

802
00:57:03.367 --> 00:57:05.081
She's not good for my health.

803
00:57:05.081 --> 00:57:08.787
Just the fact that I'm even discussing
that woman with you right now

804
00:57:08.787 --> 00:57:11.217
is really putting a strain
on the blood vessels in my brain.

805
00:57:11.217 --> 00:57:14.050
If you just did nothing, there would be
no reason for us to discuss this.

806
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.400
To me, she's someone I don't even
want to meet or think about.

807
00:57:20.246 --> 00:57:24.751
You didn't even blink when you were told
that I was on my deathbed...

808
00:57:24.751 --> 00:57:28.121
and yet, you're saying these things to me
because I'm trying to make her move?

809
00:57:33.284 --> 00:57:36.702
What do I need to do in order for you
to leave her alone, Mom?

810
00:57:39.171 --> 00:57:41.680
Does that mean you'll promise
to do anything I ask?

811
00:57:43.021 --> 00:57:45.209
If it's something that
I can do, then I'll do it.

812
00:57:50.938 --> 00:57:52.572
Yoon Bok.

813
00:57:52.572 --> 00:57:54.925
I don't care where you go.

814
00:57:54.925 --> 00:57:56.985
Just leave Yoon Bok here before you go.

815
00:57:56.985 --> 00:57:58.360
That's all I ask.

816
00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.967
Yoon Bok is my daughter.

817
00:57:59.967 --> 00:58:02.340
I'm going to take her with me
no matter where I may go.

818
00:58:09.423 --> 00:58:10.842
All right.

819
00:58:11.735 --> 00:58:13.546
I won't go anywhere for the time being.

820
00:58:13.546 --> 00:58:15.869
I'll live at your house with Yoon Bok.

821
00:58:16.673 --> 00:58:18.113
Is that good enough?

822
00:58:22.717 --> 00:58:24.688
I really don't want to, though.

823
00:58:24.688 --> 00:58:27.273
Being a mom is so unfair.

824
00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:30.778
To think that loving your child more than
they love you could be a weakness.

825
00:58:31.932 --> 00:58:33.131
Jae Beom.

826
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:34.236
Yes, Madam?

827
00:58:34.236 --> 00:58:36.247
Call that woman.

828
00:58:36.823 --> 00:58:38.673
And tell her that
she doesn't have to move.

829
00:58:38.673 --> 00:58:39.711
Pardon?

830
00:58:43.202 --> 00:58:45.086
Things must be so difficult for you

831
00:58:45.086 --> 00:58:47.852
so thank you for agreeing
to be interviewed.

832
00:58:49.043 --> 00:58:50.291
It's fine.

833
00:58:50.871 --> 00:58:54.590
Um, may I see a photo of Hye Na?

834
00:58:55.287 --> 00:58:56.405
Why?

835
00:58:57.343 --> 00:58:58.910
Um...

836
00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:01.251
I want to use it when
I'm writing the article.

837
00:59:02.718 --> 00:59:04.032
No.

838
00:59:06.771 --> 00:59:10.657
I didn't want strangers
to see my daughter's face

839
00:59:10.657 --> 00:59:12.751
so I didn't even let them
use a photo of her on TV.

840
00:59:12.751 --> 00:59:13.782
Oh.

841
00:59:13.782 --> 00:59:16.073
I'm not going to release it
as a part of the article.

842
00:59:16.073 --> 00:59:18.371
It's just that, when I saw
the news broadcast about her

843
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:22.124
she seemed to be similar
to a girl that I know...

844
00:59:22.124 --> 00:59:24.755
I'm sorry, but I don't have any photos.

845
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.305
And I've deleted all the photos of
Hye Na that I had on my phone, too

846
00:59:28.305 --> 00:59:30.182
because they were upsetting me.

847
00:59:40.235 --> 00:59:41.834
I'm home.

848
00:59:53.677 --> 00:59:55.064
Honey!

849
00:59:57.631 --> 00:59:58.843
Honey!

850
00:59:58.843 --> 01:00:02.749
We had legitimate reasons,
which is why we arrested her.

851
01:00:02.749 --> 01:00:04.959
There's no way we would've
done it for no reason.

852
01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:07.968
Like what, exactly?

853
01:00:07.968 --> 01:00:10.441
Were they related to
Hye Na's disappearance?

854
01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:13.698
I can't give you specifics
since it's an ongoing investigation.

855
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:16.557
Sheesh.

856
01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:18.086
Yes.

857
01:00:18.086 --> 01:00:20.959
We did have concrete evidence
of child abuse.

858
01:00:20.959 --> 01:00:23.986
But it wasn't directly
related to the case.

859
01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.523
Then, by any chance...

860
01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:31.271
do you have a flyer of Kim Hye Na that
was distributed when she went missing?

861
01:00:31.771 --> 01:00:33.720
- Why do you ask?
- For reference.

862
01:00:35.945 --> 01:00:38.878
Hey, go get a flyer of Hye Na.

863
01:00:47.296 --> 01:00:50.842
<i>What do you want most
as a Christmas present?</i>

864
01:00:50.842 --> 01:00:52.160
<i>Um...</i>

865
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:53.997
<i>a younger sibling?</i>

866
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:58.311
<i>I'll have to start seeing a man, then.</i>

867
01:00:59.383 --> 01:01:00.622
Where should we hang this one?

868
01:01:01.398 --> 01:01:02.764
<i>- Here.
- Here?</i>

869
01:01:02.764 --> 01:01:03.954
<i>Let's put it here.</i>

870
01:01:04.544 --> 01:01:06.673
<i>Wow, how pretty!</i>

871
01:01:06.673 --> 01:01:08.186
<i>Here.</i>

872
01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:10.392
<i>We didn't arrest her for no reason.</i>

873
01:01:10.392 --> 01:01:12.240
We have plenty of evidence.

874
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.898
Even if the child may have died
for some other reason

875
01:01:14.898 --> 01:01:16.635
I still think that

876
01:01:16.635 --> 01:01:19.146
she should be punished for
abusing her before her death.

877
01:01:21.217 --> 01:01:22.396
Here.
