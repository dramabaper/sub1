1
00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:04.616
Grandpa!

2
00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:10.949
Of course I passed!

3
00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:13.908
No, really!

4
00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.491
I'll be attending their university.

5
00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:20.449
I'll be entering competitions.
And then I'll be in the national team!

6
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.574
The Olympics?

7
00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:24.824
Yeah! Of course I'll be there.

8
00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:28.240
You just wait, grandpa.

9
00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:31.115
I'm bringing that gold medal home.
I'll hang it around your neck!

10
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.032
Oh, right.
They are providing for my housing,

11
00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.657
and they are paying my tuition!

12
00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:38.782
Isn't it awesome?

13
00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:45.989
Grandpa. You are eating well, right?

14
00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:51.949
I'll call you often.

15
00:01:52.824 --> 00:01:53.699
All right.

16
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.115
That was careless of you today.

17
00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:25.989
I'm retiring.

18
00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:27.407
I'm serious.

19
00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:32.324
Just as we eat three meals a day,

20
00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:34.532
there's a proper time for retirement.

21
00:02:34.532 --> 00:02:36.240
I'm sick of sports.

22
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.324
Says the person who just
raced like his life depended on it.

23
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.782
Your hatred of losing is
what still drives you.

24
00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:50.949
That boy…

25
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.949
He'll be an excellent
training partner for you.

26
00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:55.115
Do not disappoint me again.

27
00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.115
If you lose again…

28
00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.449
You'll be his pacesetter.

29
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.407
Of course I will.

30
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.115
Those Olympic medals are everything to you.

31
00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:10.741
What?

32
00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:13.032
I only wanted to make you a good athlete.

33
00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:14.240
Do you know how much effort I put into you?

34
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.616
That was for your own satisfaction.

35
00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:17.407
It wasn't for me.

36
00:03:20.782 --> 00:03:23.449
I'm moving out.

37
00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:27.157
I always stayed in the dorm
while training anyway.

38
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.949
Nothing new, right?

39
00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:33.449
You will commute from home.

40
00:03:34.073 --> 00:03:35.073
No.

41
00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:41.324
Why, you!

42
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:43.741
What's with the sudden rebellion?

43
00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:49.782
No can one decide your worth

44
00:03:50.032 --> 00:03:51.365
but yourself.

45
00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.449
You have excellent musculature, but

46
00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.824
you're lacking in basic skills
and competition tactics.

47
00:03:57.908 --> 00:03:58.908
On the other hand, Eun-ho has

48
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.574
strong foundational assets.

49
00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:07.824
Bend down! Lower that hip!

50
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.657
Bend down a bit lower.
Your upper body is rising.

51
00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:17.324
Proper form is the first thing you learn
when you start speed skating.

52
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.949
Sure, sure.

53
00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.073
Lower that upper body,
and bend down at the hip.

54
00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:22.532
- Hold your arm!
- Sure, sure…

55
00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:24.449
Move your legs like your pushing
to the sides, step by step.

56
00:04:27.908 --> 00:04:28.782
In other words,

57
00:04:29.365 --> 00:04:31.032
you are just a novice.

58
00:04:31.282 --> 00:04:32.157
Darn it!

59
00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.282
Bend down! Lower that hip!

60
00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:35.491
Aaargh!

61
00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:38.324
Oh, and one more thing.

62
00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:41.908
When competing, never get excited.

63
00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:44.908
That's a common rookie mistake.

64
00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:48.032
Losing one's temper when
provoked by an opponent,

65
00:04:48.032 --> 00:04:49.616
and speeding up too much.

66
00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:51.449
Or trying too hard to pass him.

67
00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.365
These often lead to defeat.

68
00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.282
Oh, you mean like you did the last time?

69
00:04:57.324 --> 00:04:58.032
Why, you…

70
00:04:59.616 --> 00:05:00.407
So what's going on?

71
00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:02.365
What's this sudden urge to practice?

72
00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:03.699
I could say the same to you.

73
00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:07.990
Have you finally realized that
you have a long way to go?

74
00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:09.532
Is that why you are practicing?

75
00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:10.782
I won't deny that.

76
00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:14.240
You have better forms than I do.

77
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.782
What made you admit it?

78
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.324
Looks like you still don't know me.

79
00:05:18.324 --> 00:05:21.199
I admit what's right.

80
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.989
And I do what I set out to do.

81
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.073
That's who I am.

82
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.449
Oh, is that right?

83
00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:28.407
So? You want me to teach you a lesson?

84
00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.491
Teach me?

85
00:05:30.407 --> 00:05:32.741
Yeah, right! You wouldn't know fast
if it slapped you in the face!

86
00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:34.491
Stay in your place, man.

87
00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:35.574
You are asking for it!

88
00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:38.282
Come on, then!

89
00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:40.449
Bring it!

90
00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:42.949
Oh, you are dead! Come here!

91
00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.574
Oh, is he still at the rink?

92
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.866
He left a while ago,
if you are talking about Man-bok.

93
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.532
No! I'm talking about Ho-young!

94
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.616
He left just now.

95
00:06:32.657 --> 00:06:34.324
Already?

96
00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:36.407
He's supposed to tell me about the match.

97
00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.199
Oh, and your ankles are a bit weak, right?

98
00:06:43.616 --> 00:06:45.032
You might need some reinforcement training.

99
00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:46.949
Eun-ho

100
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.532
You dance hard.

101
00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:39.532
But it's not… natural.

102
00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:41.491
There's no soul.

103
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:44.032
Just because you've got technique,

104
00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:46.989
doesn't mean you dance well.

105
00:08:47.782 --> 00:08:48.491
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:48.657 --> 00:08:50.782
You aren't exactly what we're looking for.

107
00:09:20.741 --> 00:09:21.990
Hey, wipe that drool off your face.

108
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:22.741
Huh?

109
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:24.824
She's messing up the restaurant!

110
00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:27.199
Just hold it for a minute!

111
00:09:27.657 --> 00:09:28.908
She's hot!

112
00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:30.407
What is?

113
00:09:30.657 --> 00:09:31.574
What part of her is hot?

114
00:09:32.908 --> 00:09:34.240
Look at those fingertips!

115
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.115
How does she pose like that?

116
00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:38.407
I think she's really pretty.

117
00:09:40.073 --> 00:09:42.699
I guess… technically.

118
00:09:44.324 --> 00:09:46.073
If it weren't for that leg injury
during her childhood,

119
00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:47.240
she would have continued
as a figure skater.

120
00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:49.782
Wait, she had an injury?
When she was little?

121
00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:52.782
Yup. Used to be a promising skater, too.

122
00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:54.449
The next queen of figure skating…

123
00:09:54.491 --> 00:09:57.032
But that was then.
After the injury, she quit.

124
00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:00.657
I thought she was actually studying.
I guess she's just playing around.

125
00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:02.699
Hey, come on.

126
00:10:02.699 --> 00:10:05.699
Your cousin is trying to be an artist,
not playing around.

127
00:10:05.741 --> 00:10:07.073
Artist my foot!

128
00:10:19.157 --> 00:10:22.115
That was really cool, your dance!

129
00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:23.990
I don't know much about dancing,

130
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.574
but I know a good dance when I see it.
That was the best!

131
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:28.866
Doesn't even matter.

132
00:10:28.866 --> 00:10:30.199
I failed the audition.

133
00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:31.324
Failed?

134
00:10:34.407 --> 00:10:36.449
Oh, that's good!
So you are going back to America?

135
00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:39.532
Not a chance!
I'm going to try until I make it.

136
00:10:41.032 --> 00:10:43.282
By the way, you were really cool earlier!

137
00:10:43.282 --> 00:10:44.741
I've never seen someone on ice

138
00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:47.407
move so freely like that!

139
00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:50.199
You both were amazing.

140
00:10:52.157 --> 00:10:53.032
Nah…

141
00:10:55.282 --> 00:10:56.282
Hey, Ji-na.

142
00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:03.199
Why do you keep showing up here?

143
00:11:03.616 --> 00:11:05.032
I'm not here for you. Stay out of this.

144
00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:23.949
What are they talking about for so long?

145
00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:26.699
Kind of fishy, isn't it?

146
00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:28.824
Not really.
They probably have things to talk about.

147
00:11:28.824 --> 00:11:32.908
Hey, that's your cousin!
This late at night!

148
00:11:32.908 --> 00:11:34.824
All alone with that predator over there…

149
00:11:35.115 --> 00:11:36.616
Are you seriously not worried at all?

150
00:11:36.616 --> 00:11:38.073
Is that strange?

151
00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.699
Of course it's strange!

152
00:11:42.407 --> 00:11:45.115
I'm a trustworthy and upright person.
But that guy?

153
00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:52.699
Retire? Yeah, that was careless of you.

154
00:11:53.073 --> 00:11:54.990
I saw your match today.

155
00:11:55.699 --> 00:11:57.282
You obviously love skating, so why retire?

156
00:11:57.657 --> 00:12:00.449
You were skating out there
like you'd never quit.

157
00:12:02.157 --> 00:12:05.115
I used to be an athlete too.
Figure skating.

158
00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:10.866
I quit because of an injury,
but sometimes I still think about it.

159
00:12:12.741 --> 00:12:14.949
Quitting something you love…

160
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:19.407
Being unable to do something
you really want…

161
00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:21.073
It's really sad.

162
00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:25.574
And you are going to just quit
your beloved speed skating

163
00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:27.824
just to show it to your dad?

164
00:12:28.908 --> 00:12:29.990
No. Don't do that.

165
00:12:33.657 --> 00:12:35.157
You sound like an adult.

166
00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:37.990
Heh, really? Sorry.

167
00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:43.115
Anyway, I just don't think
you should quit sports.

168
00:12:43.115 --> 00:12:44.949
To hear this from you…

169
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:48.990
I guess I really did make a mistake.

170
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.699
But I'm still moving out.

171
00:12:53.699 --> 00:12:54.616
You are moving out?

172
00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:58.115
Hey, why is he coming with us?

173
00:12:58.782 --> 00:13:00.115
He's looking for a place to live.

174
00:13:00.657 --> 00:13:02.491
Exactly. Why is he heading to your place?

175
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:06.866
I guess… to ask my mom?

176
00:13:07.365 --> 00:13:08.908
There are real estate offices for a reason!

177
00:13:09.324 --> 00:13:10.324
You're right!

178
00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:11.824
Then, I guess… dinner?

179
00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:17.282
I don't know. I'm starving.
I wonder what mom made for dinner.

180
00:13:17.282 --> 00:13:20.574
By the way, how long are you
staying at our place?

181
00:13:20.574 --> 00:13:21.407
What? You don't like me there?

182
00:13:21.407 --> 00:13:22.989
Just until I'm assigned to a dorm.

183
00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:24.407
Hey, that's not what I meant.

184
00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:25.866
Just curious is all.

185
00:13:25.866 --> 00:13:27.449
Look! A little too close, don't you think?

186
00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:29.449
Do something, man!

187
00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:34.449
Hey! Keep some distance!
Step aside!

188
00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:42.908
My, my! Sorry for the wait!

189
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:46.449
Sorry for the wait!

190
00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:47.574
Come on! Let's eat!

191
00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:50.949
Thank you!

192
00:13:51.115 --> 00:13:51.741
Enjoy!

193
00:13:52.324 --> 00:13:54.324
Enjoy, Ho-young!

194
00:13:56.532 --> 00:13:57.782
You are not eating?

195
00:13:58.073 --> 00:14:00.949
Huh? Of course I am…

196
00:14:02.657 --> 00:14:04.491
Why? Are you not hungry?

197
00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:05.989
No, that's not it.

198
00:14:11.657 --> 00:14:13.282
This just reminds me of my mother.

199
00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:19.157
She died when I was little.

200
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:30.032
I can't even imagine
how your mother must've felt…

201
00:14:30.032 --> 00:14:31.365
Leaving this sweet boy behind…

202
00:14:32.407 --> 00:14:33.324
Enjoy.

203
00:14:33.324 --> 00:14:36.282
Pretend your mother made these for you.

204
00:14:36.282 --> 00:14:39.407
We've got plenty,
so have as much as you want.

205
00:14:40.324 --> 00:14:42.240
That's so sad…

206
00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:47.574
Sure is eating like a champion!

207
00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:52.324
Oh, that's right.
He is looking for a place to live.

208
00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:54.574
Do you know anyone
who works at a real estate office?

209
00:14:55.989 --> 00:14:57.616
You are looking for a room?

210
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.657
Yes, but I'm in no hurry!

211
00:15:02.491 --> 00:15:04.407
No hurry?
Don't waste your time searching!

212
00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:06.240
We've got plenty of rooms here!

213
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:09.199
No? There's that room by the gate.

214
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.989
There's also the storage room.
Just needs some cleaning.

215
00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:13.282
Man-bok and Man-hee have rooms.
They are huge!

216
00:15:13.282 --> 00:15:14.782
Mom!

217
00:15:14.782 --> 00:15:18.699
Don't athletes share rooms
in training camps?

218
00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:21.532
How about it? Do you want to
try sharing Man-bok's room?

219
00:15:21.532 --> 00:15:22.908
Wait. That might be a bit uncomfortable.

220
00:15:23.365 --> 00:15:24.989
Not at all!

221
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.324
It's a nice, big room.
Nothing uncomfortable!

222
00:15:28.324 --> 00:15:30.324
I slept there last night, so I know.

223
00:15:30.365 --> 00:15:33.365
So then… do you want to board here?

224
00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.365
Don't worry about meals here!

225
00:15:35.365 --> 00:15:37.407
My cooking skills are like…

226
00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:39.240
you know what I mean?

227
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.032
Now, eat.

228
00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:42.989
Thank you so much.

229
00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:56.782
What are you doing?

230
00:15:57.782 --> 00:15:59.157
Can't you tell?

231
00:15:59.657 --> 00:16:01.157
There was so much dust here!

232
00:16:01.157 --> 00:16:02.741
It'd give you all kinds of disease.

233
00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:06.073
So why stay in this "disease-ridden" room?

234
00:16:06.073 --> 00:16:07.699
Why board here?

235
00:16:07.699 --> 00:16:09.699
You've got a nice house, right?

236
00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:12.240
None of your business!

237
00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:20.616
What happened to my room?

238
00:16:21.324 --> 00:16:22.989
It's weird, right?

239
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.115
You can thank the crawling rich boy here.

240
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.616
Now that's what I call a room.

241
00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:33.699
It was like a pigsty before.

242
00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:34.866
A pigsty? You little…

243
00:16:34.908 --> 00:16:38.115
Anyway, this will be my room from now on.

244
00:16:38.115 --> 00:16:40.115
You two need to… leave.

245
00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:42.073
What are you talking about?
This is my room!

246
00:16:42.073 --> 00:16:43.574
That's right! This is Man-bok's room!

247
00:16:43.574 --> 00:16:44.491
What are you talking about?

248
00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:48.115
Your mother told me to use this room.
Get out!

249
00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:49.240
No! This is my room!

250
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:49.699
I'm not moving either.

251
00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:50.699
Not moving, huh?

252
00:16:50.989 --> 00:16:51.949
Get out! Now!

253
00:16:52.407 --> 00:16:55.032
- Not a chance!
- You get out!

254
00:16:56.199 --> 00:16:58.282
Get him out!
Open the door and get him out!

255
00:16:58.324 --> 00:16:59.199
But I cleaned that room!

256
00:16:59.282 --> 00:17:00.032
Watch the dust! The dust!

257
00:17:00.073 --> 00:17:00.782
You get out!

258
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.365
You probably all know this already.

259
00:17:05.365 --> 00:17:07.908
This is Kang Ho-young.
He'll be joining us from today.

260
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.657
Let's hear it for him.

261
00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:14.989
He's still new,
so he might need some help adjusting.

262
00:17:14.989 --> 00:17:16.657
Help each other and train together!

263
00:17:16.657 --> 00:17:18.574
Only two months left until
the national team qualification match.

264
00:17:18.574 --> 00:17:19.866
It's a chance to bring honor to the team

265
00:17:19.866 --> 00:17:22.199
and to yourselves as well.

266
00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:23.949
Put everything into your training.

267
00:17:25.073 --> 00:17:26.449
But enough introduction…

268
00:17:29.365 --> 00:17:32.073
It's PT time!
Your favorite time of the day!

269
00:17:32.073 --> 00:17:32.949
Let's begin!

270
00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:34.532
- Kangbaek!
- Let's go!

271
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:39.657
Heater repair work at the dormitory?

272
00:17:40.782 --> 00:17:43.949
Then… have Kang Ho-young
stay at my place for now.

273
00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:46.949
Yes, sir. I'll have it arranged.

274
00:17:46.949 --> 00:17:51.949
And… I heard Eun-ho is staying
at a boarding house.

275
00:17:53.157 --> 00:17:56.157
Should I go bring him back?

276
00:17:56.741 --> 00:17:59.199
No. Just find out the address.

277
00:18:00.824 --> 00:18:01.657
Oh… certainly.

278
00:18:01.657 --> 00:18:03.491
What... what are you talking about?

279
00:18:04.491 --> 00:18:07.866
What? Are you deaf or something?

280
00:18:07.866 --> 00:18:10.449
You weren't like this
when you borrowed our money.

281
00:18:10.449 --> 00:18:13.657
And now that you have to pay it back,
you are having memory issues?

282
00:18:13.657 --> 00:18:15.449
I didn't borrow your money!
It was that woman…

283
00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:17.532
Why do I have to pay it back?

284
00:18:17.532 --> 00:18:19.949
You didn't know?

285
00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:21.365
When she borrowed the money,

286
00:18:21.407 --> 00:18:24.240
she took it as a joint loan!
Cosigned with your name!

287
00:18:24.782 --> 00:18:27.407
And now she's nowhere to be found!

288
00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:29.032
So who should pay it back?

289
00:18:29.032 --> 00:18:32.157
The cosigner! Obviously!

290
00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:35.491
That makes no sense!

291
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:37.949
Well aren't you stubborn!

292
00:18:39.407 --> 00:18:42.115
You can sort it out among yourselves later.

293
00:18:44.073 --> 00:18:45.866
This place looks expensive.

294
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.407
You can sell it and pay us back!

295
00:18:49.866 --> 00:18:52.782
Anyway, that interest
really creeps up fast.

296
00:18:52.782 --> 00:18:54.824
Unless you want some serious trouble later,

297
00:18:54.824 --> 00:18:56.989
I'd sell it fast if I were you.

298
00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:02.324
Let's start with
a week's worth of interest.

299
00:19:07.407 --> 00:19:10.324
Then we'll all be happy
during the next visit.

300
00:19:13.282 --> 00:19:14.407
Let's go, boys.

301
00:19:16.073 --> 00:19:17.032
Good luck.

302
00:19:21.365 --> 00:19:22.989
Where in the world is that crazy broad?

303
00:19:23.574 --> 00:19:25.240
Come on in!

304
00:19:26.616 --> 00:19:27.824
What's going on?

305
00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:30.240
Just listen to me for a second.

306
00:19:30.407 --> 00:19:32.824
They are all dying to get
just a glimpse of their training!

307
00:19:32.824 --> 00:19:34.365
They are training right now!

308
00:19:35.866 --> 00:19:37.157
Just trust me, okay?

309
00:19:38.032 --> 00:19:42.657
That skater in the YouTube video
everyone is talking about…

310
00:19:42.657 --> 00:19:44.282
You are him, right?

311
00:19:45.073 --> 00:19:45.949
Huh?

312
00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:47.199
Aren't you?

313
00:19:47.199 --> 00:19:49.741
The winner of the PyeongChang amateur race!

314
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:52.989
The one who gave Park Eun-ho
a run for his money!

315
00:19:52.989 --> 00:19:55.824
The rising star! Kang Ho-young!

316
00:19:57.407 --> 00:19:58.616
Hello.

317
00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:00.491
Since we have them both here,

318
00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:02.574
Park Eun-ho and Kang Ho-young,

319
00:20:03.324 --> 00:20:04.949
let's interview them both.

320
00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:07.199
Did you say interview?

321
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:09.240
We can do that. Sure.

322
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.989
No, you can't do that.

323
00:20:11.741 --> 00:20:13.157
Get back to training!

324
00:20:13.157 --> 00:20:15.699
Your match video is
a YouTube sensation right now.

325
00:20:15.699 --> 00:20:18.115
Park Eun-ho, the short track emperor!

326
00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:20.866
And Kang Ho-young, the rising star!

327
00:20:20.866 --> 00:20:22.989
What was that race like?

328
00:20:22.989 --> 00:20:24.989
From what we've seen on that video,

329
00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:27.365
it was difficult to tell who's better.

330
00:20:29.407 --> 00:20:32.073
Well… It was a good experience.

331
00:20:34.616 --> 00:20:35.574
Same for me.

332
00:20:35.908 --> 00:20:37.866
Training together like you are right now,

333
00:20:37.866 --> 00:20:41.782
you probably know each other's weaknesses
better than anyone.

334
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:42.699
So what do you think?

335
00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:45.199
Has Park's condition recovered?

336
00:20:53.115 --> 00:20:57.199
Well, he's got a solid foundation.
He'll recover soon enough.

337
00:20:57.199 --> 00:21:01.199
A diamond in the dirt, the amazing newbie,

338
00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:03.157
the potential of a genius...

339
00:21:03.157 --> 00:21:06.282
These are what people say about Kang.

340
00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:07.989
What do you think?

341
00:21:08.866 --> 00:21:12.989
As you know, the basics are
more important than anything in skating.

342
00:21:13.699 --> 00:21:17.157
The forms you learn as a child
determine your whole career.

343
00:21:17.657 --> 00:21:19.741
The form you take during a race

344
00:21:19.741 --> 00:21:22.574
affects your record as well as
your game management.

345
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:28.616
In that sense,
Kang Ho-young is still just a kid.

346
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.949
In other words,

347
00:21:32.115 --> 00:21:35.324
he's still a very poor skater.

348
00:21:37.782 --> 00:21:39.782
Ha ha! What a fierce competition here!

349
00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:44.407
Now to Kang Ho-young, the rising star,
the lord of ice!

350
00:21:44.989 --> 00:21:47.989
How would you rate Park Eun-ho?

351
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.866
Well, people say
he's the emperor or whatever.

352
00:21:57.407 --> 00:21:59.616
Then he's a pretty weak emperor.

353
00:21:59.616 --> 00:22:03.324
He lacks endurance, you know?

354
00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:07.699
It's something he should work on, I think.

355
00:22:10.324 --> 00:22:12.574
They should be
going back to their training now.

356
00:22:12.574 --> 00:22:14.782
Let's end this interview.

357
00:22:15.324 --> 00:22:16.449
Good work.

358
00:22:22.989 --> 00:22:24.157
Still just a kid?

359
00:22:24.157 --> 00:22:28.989
Lacks endurance? What do you know?

360
00:22:28.989 --> 00:22:31.240
You always make mistakes towards the end.

361
00:22:31.866 --> 00:22:35.240
Says the guy who shakes his arms about
whenever he skates.

362
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.741
A bad form can be corrected!

363
00:22:36.741 --> 00:22:38.115
Stamina can be improved.

364
00:22:38.157 --> 00:22:39.574
I'm the short track emperor!

365
00:22:39.616 --> 00:22:41.616
Emperor? More like a loser!

366
00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:42.782
Again with that loser crap!

367
00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:49.782
I'm not going to tell you to
get along with each other.

368
00:22:49.782 --> 00:22:51.616
But if you are going to be interviewed,
do it right.

369
00:22:51.616 --> 00:22:53.199
What the heck was that?
That was painful!

370
00:22:53.199 --> 00:22:55.115
Are you trying to let everyone know
that you hate each other?

371
00:22:56.407 --> 00:22:59.032
No personal interviews from now on.
That includes talking to reporters.

372
00:22:59.574 --> 00:23:01.616
Do 30 minutes of warm up exercise
before each training session.

373
00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:03.657
Take videos and send them to me.
It's your punishment.

374
00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:04.989
Coach!

375
00:23:06.532 --> 00:23:09.449
You two stay overtime for
additional training for one week.

376
00:23:09.866 --> 00:23:12.699
3000m, 13 laps each, four times.
Then 10 laps around the track.

377
00:23:12.699 --> 00:23:13.989
Coach!

378
00:23:13.989 --> 00:23:17.115
Right. Just keep yapping.
Make that 20 laps.

379
00:23:19.282 --> 00:23:21.073
What's the delay?

380
00:23:22.782 --> 00:23:23.491
Move it!

381
00:23:47.574 --> 00:23:48.574
You all right?

382
00:23:48.574 --> 00:23:50.157
It hurts. Don't even talk to me.

383
00:23:51.866 --> 00:23:52.908
What are you, kids?

384
00:23:53.073 --> 00:23:55.240
How come you two are constantly fighting?

385
00:23:55.782 --> 00:23:56.824
How are you going to work as a team?

386
00:23:56.866 --> 00:23:58.574
Hey! Ho-young!

387
00:24:02.782 --> 00:24:04.532
Are you done training?

388
00:24:05.115 --> 00:24:06.824
Hey, I'm here too.

389
00:24:07.073 --> 00:24:09.324
Ho-young! You looked
great on screen!

390
00:24:09.324 --> 00:24:10.908
I watched the YouTube video.

391
00:24:10.908 --> 00:24:14.574
Me too! You were so good!

392
00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:25.782
I mean… yeah, I'm good.

393
00:24:25.782 --> 00:24:26.990
But I'm better.

394
00:24:27.824 --> 00:24:29.282
Shut up over there…

395
00:25:04.507 --> 00:25:07.507
What are you chuckling about?

396
00:25:07.507 --> 00:25:08.674
Huh? It's nothing.

397
00:25:09.632 --> 00:25:10.757
Hey! These hands right here…

398
00:25:11.215 --> 00:25:14.299
They did something great today!

399
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:19.090
Like this? Like a gentleman?

400
00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:25.674
By the way, what's up with Man-hee?

401
00:25:28.132 --> 00:25:30.132
This blind fool right here…

402
00:25:30.132 --> 00:25:31.757
Why does she even like you?

403
00:25:34.591 --> 00:25:36.591
- What? Why?
- Just shut up!

404
00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:40.591
What do you want me to do?

405
00:25:53.132 --> 00:25:54.591
You are obsessed with cleanliness.

406
00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:57.173
It's because it's dirty.

407
00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:11.049
Ho-young! How could you?

408
00:26:11.049 --> 00:26:16.382
Whoa! You should have knocked!

409
00:26:16.382 --> 00:26:18.340
Don't look! Don't look!

410
00:26:18.507 --> 00:26:19.132
…It's nothing.

411
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.299
Don't look!

412
00:26:23.089 --> 00:26:24.049
Dust!

413
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.591
Maeng Man-hee!

414
00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:27.632
Why, you!

415
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.215
DUST!

416
00:26:34.632 --> 00:26:35.465
I saw it.

417
00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:37.799
I saw it.

418
00:26:37.924 --> 00:26:38.424
What?

419
00:26:39.632 --> 00:26:40.465
Hey, Man-hee!

420
00:26:42.966 --> 00:26:44.173
Don't look!

421
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.049
Don't look!

422
00:26:45.632 --> 00:26:46.882
Don't look!

423
00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:49.674
Don't look!

424
00:27:04.882 --> 00:27:05.716
That little…!

425
00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:26.173
They are about the same anyway…

426
00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:39.049
I'm here for the bowls.

427
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:43.549
Is your mom home?

428
00:27:43.924 --> 00:27:45.090
Yes. Why?

429
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.757
Tell her to call me. I found someone
who can give her a quick loan.

430
00:27:48.757 --> 00:27:51.049
Quick loan? Does she need money?

431
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:54.591
Yeah, just some stuff…
Anyway, be sure to tell her, okay?

432
00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:55.674
Quick loan…?

433
00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:57.966
Okay…

434
00:28:25.716 --> 00:28:26.674
You're back.

435
00:28:27.132 --> 00:28:28.049
Did you collect the bowls?

436
00:28:28.257 --> 00:28:29.549
Yeah, I took them back to the restaurant.

437
00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:32.799
Oh, good job. Go get some rest.

438
00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:38.966
Hey, mom?

439
00:28:38.966 --> 00:28:39.465
Hmm?

440
00:28:42.089 --> 00:28:43.008
It's nothing…

441
00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:48.132
Boring kid…

442
00:28:55.465 --> 00:28:56.757
Hey, Man-hee!

443
00:28:57.089 --> 00:28:59.632
What do you do around here?
Go help with the dishes or something.

444
00:28:59.882 --> 00:29:01.257
I'm a high school senior!

445
00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:03.716
So what? You eat too, don't you?

446
00:29:04.716 --> 00:29:06.549
Besides, you already got accepted
to a college.

447
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:08.757
I still have stuff to do!

448
00:29:09.257 --> 00:29:11.924
Do you ever wonder how hard it is for mom
to feed all these people?

449
00:29:13.008 --> 00:29:15.841
She works at the restaurant all day
and comes home to take care of you.

450
00:29:16.841 --> 00:29:18.674
How tough do you think that is?

451
00:29:19.882 --> 00:29:21.008
What's with you all of a sudden?

452
00:29:21.008 --> 00:29:22.424
Mom's having a tough time!

453
00:29:25.382 --> 00:29:27.173
You two do the cleaning from now on.

454
00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:30.382
Ji-na. You come out and help too! Got it?

455
00:29:37.757 --> 00:29:39.382
He thinks he's so nice. Seriously…

456
00:29:41.173 --> 00:29:43.008
Has Man-bok always been like that?

457
00:29:53.132 --> 00:29:55.465
If you want to stay here,
help out with the deliveries.

458
00:29:56.173 --> 00:29:58.132
Or you can serve at the restaurant
during the busy hours.

459
00:30:00.008 --> 00:30:00.799
Huh? Why?

460
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.089
Were you expecting free meals?

461
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.757
Okay, got it. Whatever you need!

462
00:30:13.507 --> 00:30:15.215
How much are you paying us?

463
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:18.132
How much do you want?

464
00:30:19.089 --> 00:30:20.257
Are you going to pay whatever?

465
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:23.008
Tell me. How much is it?

466
00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:27.340
Then I'm going to call it a little high.
You know my mom's cooking skills.

467
00:30:27.674 --> 00:30:29.716
You get unlimited meals, and you have my room…

468
00:30:29.716 --> 00:30:30.507
400,000 won a month.

469
00:30:30.507 --> 00:30:33.841
Hey, hey! That's too little!

470
00:30:33.882 --> 00:30:34.716
Go higher!

471
00:30:36.089 --> 00:30:40.757
I'll give you 500,000.
But I want the room for myself.

472
00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:41.841
Hey, no way!

473
00:30:41.841 --> 00:30:45.382
Fine. We'll sleep here for tonight.

474
00:30:45.382 --> 00:30:47.132
I'll move everything out to the
room by the gate tomorrow.

475
00:30:47.132 --> 00:30:48.591
But you pay on the first day of the month.

476
00:30:56.924 --> 00:31:01.090
Hey. Has he always been so articulate?

477
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:06.507
He's the kind of guy
who just can't see his mother suffer.

478
00:31:06.507 --> 00:31:12.674
A real good kid.
But I wonder if the business is bad…

479
00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:16.090
It's been a while
since I saw him this serious.

480
00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:05.299
Ooh! That's impressive!

481
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.882
Planning on wrestling a bull or something?

482
00:32:10.089 --> 00:32:13.299
Running like a brute like you do every day

483
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.674
is no good for speed skating at all.

484
00:32:14.716 --> 00:32:17.882
All that muscle building you do
is no good either.

485
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:19.049
You understand?

486
00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:26.215
So good to see you boys
exercising early in the morning!

487
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.924
Train harder!

488
00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:28.841
Yes ma'am!

489
00:32:41.089 --> 00:32:42.882
You want me to stay
at the chairman's house?

490
00:32:42.966 --> 00:32:45.089
The heater's broken at the dorm.

491
00:32:45.089 --> 00:32:46.924
Stay at the chairman's house for now.

492
00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:48.591
It's right next to the training center.
Should be convenient for you.

493
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:53.507
But that's still… you know…

494
00:32:54.716 --> 00:32:55.882
Don't back talk.

495
00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.257
It's just him over there.

496
00:32:58.257 --> 00:33:01.507
So no loud noises.
Greet him properly when you see him.

497
00:33:05.215 --> 00:33:06.215
All right…

498
00:33:12.173 --> 00:33:13.716
Come on in!

499
00:33:17.924 --> 00:33:21.089
We have high hopes for you, Ho-young!

500
00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:22.340
Come on upstairs!

501
00:33:23.632 --> 00:33:27.591
The chairman usually doesn't do this.

502
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:30.090
But you're very special! Very special!

503
00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:32.757
Very special!

504
00:33:32.924 --> 00:33:33.716
Come on up!

505
00:33:33.757 --> 00:33:35.299
Up here!

506
00:33:37.632 --> 00:33:38.757
You can use this room right here.

507
00:33:40.465 --> 00:33:44.090
You'll find it quite comfortable.
It's a good house.

508
00:33:47.049 --> 00:33:49.549
Would have been nice
if Eun-ho were here too.

509
00:33:52.089 --> 00:33:53.757
Get some rest for now.

510
00:33:53.757 --> 00:33:55.257
- Thank you so much!
- Sure.

511
00:33:55.716 --> 00:33:57.049
Thank you!

512
00:33:57.299 --> 00:33:59.089
- Get some rest.
- Thank you!

513
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.465
Why would that Eun-ho
leave this wonderful place?

514
00:34:29.507 --> 00:34:30.424
Hello, sir!

515
00:34:30.966 --> 00:34:32.591
Oh, how's the room?

516
00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:35.549
It's really great!

517
00:34:36.382 --> 00:34:40.132
Oh, good… I heard you skated before?

518
00:34:40.507 --> 00:34:45.132
Yes, until the first year in high school.

519
00:34:45.132 --> 00:34:48.049
The whole reason I founded
this organization is…

520
00:34:48.089 --> 00:34:50.757
to discover people like you,
to train them properly,

521
00:34:50.757 --> 00:34:52.049
and to help them become professionals.

522
00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:55.173
Here at Kangbaek,
you don't have to hold anything back.

523
00:34:55.173 --> 00:34:56.424
Thank you so much!

524
00:35:00.924 --> 00:35:03.340
In your team, there's a kid named

525
00:35:04.049 --> 00:35:05.257
Park Eun-ho. Do you know him?

526
00:35:06.799 --> 00:35:10.299
Yes, I saw him during the training.

527
00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:11.299
How is he?

528
00:35:14.299 --> 00:35:16.089
As an athlete, I mean.

529
00:35:17.507 --> 00:35:19.215
As an athlete?

530
00:35:19.215 --> 00:35:22.507
I think he's an excellent athlete.

531
00:35:22.549 --> 00:35:25.382
I'm learning a lot training with him.

532
00:35:25.549 --> 00:35:28.049
Aim to be better than him.
Never be content with anything less.

533
00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:32.215
I'm not saying this because he's my son.
He's naturally weak.

534
00:35:32.215 --> 00:35:35.132
That's why people say he lacks endurance.

535
00:35:36.008 --> 00:35:41.340
He can always train his endurance, I think.

536
00:35:43.049 --> 00:35:49.966
He's... full of strengths!

537
00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:51.424
Is that so?

538
00:35:57.549 --> 00:35:58.757
This fireplace really warms the place up!

539
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.090
By the way, that's a strange picture…

540
00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:15.089
Looks like he won a prize!
You should both be happy.

541
00:36:15.591 --> 00:36:18.507
But you both look a little stiff…

542
00:36:20.591 --> 00:36:23.632
Maybe it was just the camera flash.

543
00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.424
Come on, smile a bit!

544
00:36:29.674 --> 00:36:31.757
You know what they say.
Happy is as happy does!

545
00:36:32.049 --> 00:36:35.340
Smile! Like this!

546
00:36:35.632 --> 00:36:36.549
There we go!

547
00:36:44.882 --> 00:36:46.257
I'm here to pack my things.

548
00:37:04.257 --> 00:37:07.089
Gosh, it's like a pigsty here!

549
00:37:08.465 --> 00:37:11.089
And you were acting so clean
at Man-bok's place.

550
00:37:13.215 --> 00:37:14.632
Get out.

551
00:37:16.173 --> 00:37:19.757
Hey, be nice to your dad.

552
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.966
He's all alone here in this huge house.

553
00:37:22.424 --> 00:37:23.674
None of your business.

554
00:37:24.089 --> 00:37:26.632
You should be good to your parents
when they are still around.

555
00:37:26.757 --> 00:37:28.632
What do you know?

556
00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:33.090
Yeah, what do I know, right?
It's not even my family.

557
00:37:40.008 --> 00:37:43.089
Oh, and while we're at it…

558
00:37:44.424 --> 00:37:45.924
I'm going to date Ji-na.

559
00:37:46.173 --> 00:37:51.173
Huh? Says who?

560
00:37:51.173 --> 00:37:54.340
Whom she dates is up to her.

561
00:37:54.382 --> 00:37:56.090
It's not your call.

562
00:37:57.799 --> 00:38:00.173
What? Are you going to compete with me?

563
00:38:00.674 --> 00:38:01.674
Well I'm not turning it down.

564
00:38:01.674 --> 00:38:03.716
Do you honestly think you have a chance?

565
00:38:03.716 --> 00:38:05.382
We'll see, won't we?

566
00:38:06.716 --> 00:38:08.882
Let's do it, then!

567
00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.382
I'm not giving anything up!
Not skating! Not Ji-na!

568
00:38:11.382 --> 00:38:15.340
Be my guest! Let's do this!

569
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:24.757
The qualification match is
just around the corner.

570
00:38:24.757 --> 00:38:28.424
So we'll focus our training on
preparing for the match.

571
00:38:29.008 --> 00:38:30.882
Be sure to keep up your condition.

572
00:38:31.465 --> 00:38:32.424
Am I clear?

573
00:38:32.465 --> 00:38:33.507
Yes!

574
00:38:34.008 --> 00:38:35.090
Then let's start training!

575
00:38:37.424 --> 00:38:38.215
Let's go!

576
00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:39.674
Let's go!

577
00:38:44.215 --> 00:38:46.089
I'm going to date Ji-na.

578
00:38:46.674 --> 00:38:47.841
Says who?

579
00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:17.799
The competition starts now!

580
00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.674
I'll never lose to you!

581
00:39:27.882 --> 00:39:29.757
Let's go!

582
00:39:51.507 --> 00:39:52.632
Delicious soup is here!

583
00:39:55.382 --> 00:39:57.049
Thank you!

584
00:39:57.132 --> 00:39:59.089
Thank you!

585
00:40:46.674 --> 00:40:50.507
Boring… so boring…

586
00:41:01.966 --> 00:41:03.340
I can't take this anymore!

587
00:41:50.549 --> 00:41:51.340
Hey, Man-bok!

588
00:41:52.924 --> 00:41:54.173
Maeng Man-bok!

589
00:41:56.008 --> 00:41:57.049
Hey, wait up!

590
00:42:04.049 --> 00:42:05.299
Maeng Man-bok!

591
00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:13.591
From… all the way back there…

592
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:16.382
I've been calling you over and over!

593
00:42:16.799 --> 00:42:17.882
You didn't even answer!

594
00:42:17.882 --> 00:42:19.757
You bastard!

595
00:42:24.382 --> 00:42:27.008
I was wondering why
you were speeding like that.

596
00:42:27.382 --> 00:42:28.966
It was just a delivery?

597
00:42:28.966 --> 00:42:30.132
Just a delivery?

598
00:42:30.882 --> 00:42:33.008
It's a lot of trouble for mom if I'm late.

599
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:36.799
Oh, oh, is that right?

600
00:42:36.841 --> 00:42:38.507
What a sweet boy!

601
00:42:39.799 --> 00:42:43.049
Where did this guy come from!

602
00:42:46.966 --> 00:42:50.132
Huh? What's wrong?

603
00:42:51.215 --> 00:42:52.089
Nothing.

604
00:42:52.089 --> 00:42:55.257
You think I wouldn't notice
after all these years? What is it?

605
00:42:56.882 --> 00:43:00.173
It's really nothing.
Just thought mom could use some help.

606
00:43:04.424 --> 00:43:07.757
Huh? Ji-na! What are you doing here?

607
00:43:08.257 --> 00:43:09.465
I work here now.

608
00:43:09.465 --> 00:43:10.173
Work?

609
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:12.799
I figured I should cover my own spending.

610
00:43:12.841 --> 00:43:14.173
Until the audition, that is.

611
00:43:14.757 --> 00:43:17.716
Just wake up and go back to America.

612
00:43:17.716 --> 00:43:19.924
If uncle finds this out,
he'll give mom trouble.

613
00:43:19.924 --> 00:43:21.841
Well I'm going to pass this time!

614
00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:25.591
Also, one cup of coffee for two guys?

615
00:43:25.632 --> 00:43:26.507
That's cheap…

616
00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:02.799
Out of generosity, you let me stay here

617
00:44:02.799 --> 00:44:04.424
until the dorm is fixed.

618
00:44:04.424 --> 00:44:06.365
Thank you very much.

619
00:44:06.365 --> 00:44:09.282
But I am a bit uncomfortable here.

620
00:44:09.282 --> 00:44:10.899
I'm returning to a friend's place.

621
00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:12.924
P.S. Eun-ho is here too

622
00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:20.507
Manager, it's me.

623
00:44:21.465 --> 00:44:24.089
Find out what kind of place
Eun-ho's boarding house is.

624
00:44:25.089 --> 00:44:25.716
Yeah.

625
00:44:29.507 --> 00:44:31.424
What could possibly be so great about it

626
00:44:31.424 --> 00:44:33.424
that both of them are staying there?

627
00:44:34.966 --> 00:44:37.424
The lady at the hair salon says
she knows where you can get a loan.

628
00:44:38.215 --> 00:44:39.882
She told you that?

629
00:44:39.882 --> 00:44:41.215
Does it matter?

630
00:44:44.132 --> 00:44:48.132
Mom. Do we really need a loan?
Are things that bad?

631
00:44:49.257 --> 00:44:50.924
Why didn't you tell me anything?

632
00:44:50.924 --> 00:44:52.465
I'm your eldest son.

633
00:44:54.465 --> 00:44:56.507
You saying that is reassuring enough.

634
00:44:56.507 --> 00:44:58.089
My son! Maeng Man-bok!

635
00:44:58.089 --> 00:44:59.257
Quit joking around.

636
00:45:00.507 --> 00:45:05.882
Of course things aren't good.
Look how many mouths we're feeding.

637
00:45:06.424 --> 00:45:07.716
That's it.

638
00:45:08.008 --> 00:45:13.049
Don't you worry about a thing,
and focus on your training.

639
00:45:13.716 --> 00:45:17.966
You joining the national team,
that's my only wish.

640
00:45:19.132 --> 00:45:20.716
That's your wish?

641
00:45:21.049 --> 00:45:23.841
Of course. What else is there?

642
00:45:23.841 --> 00:45:28.089
Sounds like that Eun-ho is
a real famous athlete.

643
00:45:28.841 --> 00:45:32.465
You can learn from him and be famous!
How nice would that be?

644
00:45:33.008 --> 00:45:35.757
So you just worry about your training.

645
00:45:35.757 --> 00:45:37.089
That's how you can repay me.

646
00:45:38.382 --> 00:45:39.549
Okay.

647
00:45:45.924 --> 00:45:48.382
That hairdresser!
I should sew her mouth shut or something.

648
00:45:48.507 --> 00:45:50.716
Why tell him about the loan?

649
00:45:53.257 --> 00:45:55.716
But yeah, we are in trouble, all right.

650
00:46:02.716 --> 00:46:04.299
Whew, its cold!

651
00:47:11.424 --> 00:47:13.089
Hey, uh… here.

652
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:21.257
You came back to Korea to audition, right?

653
00:47:22.424 --> 00:47:26.632
I saw this on a wall out there.
Thought I should give it to you.

654
00:47:29.799 --> 00:47:31.340
You brought it here for me?

655
00:47:33.924 --> 00:47:38.591
I mean… yeah. It reminded me of you.

656
00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:42.089
You thought I didn't know about this?

657
00:47:48.841 --> 00:47:50.674
Huh? Oh, yeah.

658
00:47:51.008 --> 00:47:52.257
Yeah…

659
00:47:53.465 --> 00:47:55.049
No way you'd miss this.

660
00:47:55.382 --> 00:47:56.089
You know, right?

661
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.716
Just thought I should remind you.

662
00:47:57.966 --> 00:47:58.841
Here, I'll throw it away for you.

663
00:47:58.882 --> 00:48:00.632
Hey, no taking back!

664
00:48:00.799 --> 00:48:02.215
You said you brought it for me.

665
00:48:23.716 --> 00:48:26.008
Um… Yeah. You can continue.

666
00:48:27.924 --> 00:48:30.841
But hey, thanks for thinking about me.

667
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:37.591
You care so much about me!

668
00:48:38.008 --> 00:48:39.632
Now I really have to pass.

669
00:48:41.882 --> 00:48:43.257
But I'm starting to lose confidence…

670
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:44.966
Lose confidence?

671
00:48:45.716 --> 00:48:47.173
Why?

672
00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:48.674
Look here.

673
00:48:48.882 --> 00:48:53.382
You dance well. You sing well.

674
00:48:53.507 --> 00:48:55.465
You are pretty,

675
00:48:55.507 --> 00:48:57.049
and also in great shape!

676
00:48:57.257 --> 00:48:58.841
No reason you shouldn't pass!

677
00:48:58.882 --> 00:49:01.089
Just go to that audition.
First place, guaranteed.

678
00:49:01.382 --> 00:49:02.591
Am I really that good?

679
00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:04.089
Of course!

680
00:49:04.089 --> 00:49:05.841
Wait till you hear what the judges say.

681
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.966
"Where have you been all this time?"

682
00:49:08.008 --> 00:49:09.215
That's what they'll say.

683
00:49:13.716 --> 00:49:17.089
Wow, hearing you say that
really helps me a lot!

684
00:49:17.465 --> 00:49:18.299
Let's go!

685
00:49:18.882 --> 00:49:19.882
Let's go!

686
00:49:29.757 --> 00:49:31.757
<Epilogue>

687
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:33.674
Put that back.

688
00:49:33.716 --> 00:49:34.549
Come on.

689
00:49:36.591 --> 00:49:37.549
That's what I'm talking about!

690
00:49:38.424 --> 00:49:39.465
Now that's pretty!

691
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:40.257
What do you think?

692
00:49:40.257 --> 00:49:42.716
Isn't it a bit… provocative?

693
00:49:42.716 --> 00:49:45.799
That's how a good underwear should be!

694
00:49:45.799 --> 00:49:46.799
But still…

695
00:49:46.799 --> 00:49:47.632
That one over there!

696
00:49:47.799 --> 00:49:49.799
Don't even look at that one!

697
00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:51.841
If you are not feeling this one…

698
00:49:53.173 --> 00:49:53.841
How about this?

699
00:49:53.841 --> 00:49:54.757
That's pretty!

700
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:59.924
- How about this?
- This?

701
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:02.591
It's made for you!

702
00:50:02.591 --> 00:50:04.257
Red looks real good on you!
