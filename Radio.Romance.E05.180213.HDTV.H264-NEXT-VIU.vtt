1
00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:14.743
I'll be nice and show you my hideout today.

2
00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:16.343
Get in.

3
00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:18.183
I'll just go alone today...

4
00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:19.312
Get in.

5
00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:20.612
Stop talking.

6
00:00:41.903 --> 00:00:43.002
May I help you?

7
00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:50.142
I need to talk to Geu Rim.

8
00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:51.282
About what?

9
00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:54.483
Why don't you talk to me, since you're our DJ?

10
00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.452
I will speak alone with her.

11
00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:04.992
- I'll talk with him... - Stay out of it.

12
00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:08.962
Soo Ho, talk with me...

13
00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:10.693
I did the show as agreed,

14
00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:12.663
and I plan to do it like this again.

15
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:16.173
Must I deal with you two, who are always emotional?

16
00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:21.242
I plan to do it my way. If you two keep this up,

17
00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:23.742
I can't trust you as my business partner.

18
00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:25.882
Excuse me, Soo Ho.

19
00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:28.852
Go home.

20
00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:41.432
Seriously.

21
00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:44.762
Are you both going to keep this up?

22
00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:49.932
Fine, then I'm leaving.

23
00:01:53.742 --> 00:01:56.613
- Hey. - You two resolve it.

24
00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:01.482
That little punk.

25
00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:04.783
Why won't you let us have a single day of peace?

26
00:02:05.423 --> 00:02:07.523
I'm the one that's supposed to be mad.

27
00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:10.053
Isn't that Ji Soo Ho?

28
00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.622
- It is. - It's Ji Soo Ho.

29
00:02:12.722 --> 00:02:14.263
He's so handsome.

30
00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:16.233
Let's talk elsewhere.

31
00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:19.532
You're so paranoid about people watching.

32
00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:27.143
Where else could you curse me out?

33
00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:31.513
Should we go to my place or to Myeongdong?

34
00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:34.983
Should we go to Hongdae?

35
00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:38.682
Let's go to my house. Follow my car.

36
00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:55.203
Why are you...

37
00:02:58.173 --> 00:02:59.442
Why that...

38
00:03:15.622 --> 00:03:18.662
What the... That little...

39
00:04:07.173 --> 00:04:09.513
So, when is your radio show on?

40
00:04:12.842 --> 00:04:14.953
It'll be on three days from now.

41
00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:20.152
The studio is flipping out about my script.

42
00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:22.623
Don't be shocked when you listen.

43
00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:25.292
The opening is amazing.

44
00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:30.462
Daughter. Is something wrong?

45
00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:35.773
You promised not to do that to me.

46
00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:38.172
Pretending to be okay, like everything is okay.

47
00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:41.313
I can see all of that, okay?

48
00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:46.712
The truth is,

49
00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:49.782
my script was scrapped.

50
00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:51.183
So what?

51
00:04:52.623 --> 00:04:55.052
You need to get scrapped and hurt when you grow.

52
00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:58.722
You shouldn't expect to grow only on compliments.

53
00:05:01.532 --> 00:05:02.893
I guess you're right.

54
00:05:04.962 --> 00:05:06.933
Mom, but...

55
00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:10.302
I want to kill Ji Soo Ho and Lee Gang.

56
00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:12.602
Seriously...

57
00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:16.143
The two of them are driving me insane.

58
00:05:17.573 --> 00:05:19.883
Nothing will happen with them, right?

59
00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:24.352
Excuse me!

60
00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:33.893
You know, about today's show...

61
00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.193
It was super boring. Was it fun for you?

62
00:05:37.563 --> 00:05:39.102
Do you do shows for fun?

63
00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:43.273
Do we do visual radios or anything?

64
00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:44.972
We don't plan to.

65
00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:47.743
Are you not confident with just audio?

66
00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:51.183
Win via audio? Give me a break.

67
00:05:51.282 --> 00:05:53.883
Isn't visual radio the way to go?

68
00:05:53.982 --> 00:05:56.112
It's not like they're artists being sponsored.

69
00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:58.552
"The value of radio"?

70
00:05:58.782 --> 00:06:01.352
That's an old-fashioned way of thinking.

71
00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:02.523
It's always the dumb ones...

72
00:06:02.523 --> 00:06:04.722
that act like they study outside of school.

73
00:06:05.422 --> 00:06:06.563
What about our guests?

74
00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:10.133
Who are our guests?

75
00:06:11.032 --> 00:06:12.662
What about the list of star guests?

76
00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:14.133
I need the time...

77
00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:16.133
to review the list with my team.

78
00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:18.172
We won't be inviting any stars to the booth.

79
00:06:18.172 --> 00:06:21.773
We already have a star named Ji Soo Ho.

80
00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:25.513
Don't be so abstract and impromptu.

81
00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:26.612
Forward me the proposal...

82
00:06:26.612 --> 00:06:28.383
What proposal?

83
00:06:29.313 --> 00:06:30.482
Listen.

84
00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:32.883
Radio on camera.

85
00:06:32.883 --> 00:06:34.823
Abstract. Impromptu.

86
00:06:34.823 --> 00:06:38.063
Are they what you talked about with your team?

87
00:06:38.493 --> 00:06:39.493
Hey.

88
00:06:40.362 --> 00:06:42.792
I want to hear your own thoughts.

89
00:06:45.763 --> 00:06:47.703
Think before you speak.

90
00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:50.633
Do you think all will work with JH Entertainment?

91
00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:52.042
How are you going to meet...

92
00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:53.802
their expectations after getting sponsored?

93
00:06:53.802 --> 00:06:55.412
What? What?

94
00:06:55.712 --> 00:06:57.912
Did you forget how we used to beg...

95
00:06:57.912 --> 00:06:59.782
to get sponsors?

96
00:07:00.513 --> 00:07:02.282
You can't even direct.

97
00:07:05.152 --> 00:07:06.683
I had enough.

98
00:07:06.753 --> 00:07:07.922
Give me your guest list.

99
00:07:09.592 --> 00:07:11.193
I said, hand it over!

100
00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:13.662
Your writers were just as horrible.

101
00:07:13.662 --> 00:07:15.433
Why do you only reject Geu Rim's?

102
00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:16.792
Why are you talking casually to me?

103
00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:19.003
If it bothers you, you can do the same.

104
00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:21.373
By the way, I deleted it.

105
00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:23.602
- Delete what? - The first recording.

106
00:07:25.302 --> 00:07:27.743
If you keep doing whatever you want,

107
00:07:27.743 --> 00:07:29.842
I'll keep deleting it since that's my right.

108
00:07:29.943 --> 00:07:31.943
That's all my job entails, right?

109
00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:34.143
I'm thirsty.

110
00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.282
(Soju)

111
00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:39.383
Do you want some?

112
00:07:51.232 --> 00:07:52.232
The lunatic is out of reach.

113
00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:53.962
I'm so scared.

114
00:07:54.003 --> 00:07:55.732
He left with Soo Ho.

115
00:07:56.873 --> 00:07:58.373
Geu Rim, take a look at this.

116
00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:00.302
Gosh.

117
00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:02.773
What are you doing?

118
00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:04.842
I said, what are you doing?

119
00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:07.982
- Gosh. - I'm speechless.

120
00:08:08.282 --> 00:08:10.852
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

121
00:08:10.852 --> 00:08:11.852
What?

122
00:08:16.393 --> 00:08:18.523
I'm sorry. Stop.

123
00:08:18.523 --> 00:08:19.893
Hey, call the police!

124
00:08:19.893 --> 00:08:21.662
Call the police!

125
00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:25.462
Are you going to throw your headset again?

126
00:08:25.462 --> 00:08:28.133
No! I won't throw it.

127
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:31.902
- I'll really murder you. - Sir. Sir.

128
00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:35.412
The DJ suffered panic disorder afterwards.

129
00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:37.312
He quit right away.

130
00:08:40.843 --> 00:08:44.383
(Monsoon: Geu Rim, take a look at this.)

131
00:08:44.383 --> 00:08:45.383
I found it!

132
00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:48.253
This is how he brought the DJ back the next day.

133
00:08:56.292 --> 00:08:57.593
Drive over me...

134
00:08:57.593 --> 00:08:58.733
if you want to leave radio.

135
00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:00.103
- Hey! - What?

136
00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:01.133
Move it!

137
00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:02.233
We can work together,

138
00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:03.773
or you can drive over me.

139
00:09:10.843 --> 00:09:12.343
Gosh...

140
00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:20.582
Gosh, no.

141
00:09:21.023 --> 00:09:23.493
I'm sure nothing will happen.

142
00:09:30.692 --> 00:09:31.733
Do you want some?

143
00:09:35.532 --> 00:09:38.343
By the way, you didn't threaten to quit the show.

144
00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:40.743
I'm far from someone...

145
00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:42.613
who quits and gives up.

146
00:09:42.613 --> 00:09:43.672
Same with me.

147
00:09:43.672 --> 00:09:45.082
I never lost in my life.

148
00:09:45.082 --> 00:09:46.113
Me neither.

149
00:09:46.113 --> 00:09:48.213
However, I can't work with you.

150
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.883
Either I quit, or you should quit.

151
00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:54.082
There are so many production directors.

152
00:09:54.082 --> 00:09:56.792
How can I work with someone who threatens me?

153
00:09:56.792 --> 00:09:58.223
Exactly.

154
00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:01.363
Your contract with Geu Rim is ridiculous.

155
00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:03.593
A contract is based on mutual trust.

156
00:10:03.593 --> 00:10:06.202
It's a document that proves an agreement.

157
00:10:06.202 --> 00:10:07.202
Don't you know?

158
00:10:08.003 --> 00:10:09.302
Then,

159
00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:12.202
you must always follow what you signed, right?

160
00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:14.302
You think mutual trust is important.

161
00:10:14.442 --> 00:10:15.442
Of course.

162
00:10:20.343 --> 00:10:21.353
What?

163
00:10:21.383 --> 00:10:23.213
Are you going to lie again and say you can't drink?

164
00:10:23.213 --> 00:10:24.952
How boring.

165
00:10:31.062 --> 00:10:32.723
In all my life,

166
00:10:32.723 --> 00:10:34.863
I've never lost in a fight.

167
00:10:35.393 --> 00:10:37.062
I'm going to do...

168
00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:39.233
everything in my power...

169
00:10:40.532 --> 00:10:42.103
to beat Song Geu Rim.

170
00:10:43.932 --> 00:10:45.172
You're not in this alone.

171
00:10:45.172 --> 00:10:47.942
We're doing it together. Remember?

172
00:10:50.572 --> 00:10:52.042
Do you know...

173
00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.282
how many DJs quit because of me?

174
00:10:55.682 --> 00:10:56.952
Do you know how many...

175
00:10:56.952 --> 00:10:58.822
production directors quit because of me?

176
00:11:00.182 --> 00:11:03.422
Your team is terrible.

177
00:11:03.422 --> 00:11:05.922
They don't know anything about radios.

178
00:11:06.263 --> 00:11:08.792
Your proposal was pretty garbage too.

179
00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:11.032
I don't know much about radio,

180
00:11:11.302 --> 00:11:13.902
but I could tell your proposal was bad.

181
00:11:16.873 --> 00:11:17.873
If...

182
00:11:18.373 --> 00:11:19.873
our next proposal doesn't make it,

183
00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:21.412
I'll quit.

184
00:11:23.873 --> 00:11:26.312
Please. That's my wish.

185
00:11:31.753 --> 00:11:34.952
Guess what? I've never lost in my life.

186
00:11:38.822 --> 00:11:39.822
And you think I have?

187
00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:47.332
I'm Lee Gang.

188
00:11:47.432 --> 00:11:49.202
I'm Ji Soo Ho.

189
00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:05.723
More.

190
00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:16.133
By the way,

191
00:12:16.393 --> 00:12:19.032
I can't get in touch with Mr. Lee since yesterday.

192
00:12:19.263 --> 00:12:20.263
Did any of you get through to him?

193
00:12:20.263 --> 00:12:21.603
He must be sitting in a corner...

194
00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:23.503
and saying, "Namaste".

(The last graduation)

197
00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:34.412
Hello. I'm a teacher...

198
00:12:34.412 --> 00:12:36.452
at Dongil Elementary School...

199
00:12:36.452 --> 00:12:37.753
in Inje County.

200
00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:39.922
We only have a few days until our school...

201
00:12:39.922 --> 00:12:41.422
holds the last graduation ceremony.

202
00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:43.853
That's why I'm writing here.

203
00:12:44.292 --> 00:12:46.822
What do you think about the graduation posting?

204
00:12:46.822 --> 00:12:48.263
Can we turn that into a segment?

205
00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:50.363
Why are you working so hard?

206
00:12:50.363 --> 00:12:51.463
No matter what we do,

207
00:12:51.463 --> 00:12:53.133
Ji Soo Ho's staff will turn it down anyway.

208
00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:54.233
Don't work so hard.

209
00:12:55.032 --> 00:12:58.072
I'm glad they have a planning team.

210
00:12:58.072 --> 00:12:59.542
It makes it easier for us.

What is that?

00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:10.412
- What is that? - What?

214
00:13:19.463 --> 00:13:22.192
What did you just say?

215
00:13:25.202 --> 00:13:27.332
"No matter what we do,"

I'm sorry.

218
00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:37.513

for this in one hour.

220

In one hour?

221
00:13:40.812 --> 00:13:41.812
What is it?

222
00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:44.883
You better not tell me you can't do it.

223
00:13:46.253 --> 00:13:47.253
No...

224
00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:49.393
Hey.

225
00:13:50.452 --> 00:13:52.523
Shut your mouth and make a new song list.

226
00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:54.192
Yes. It was already shut.

227
00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:55.932
Your research was garbage.

228
00:13:55.932 --> 00:13:57.963
That's why the writing was horrible.

229
00:13:58.503 --> 00:14:00.032
Did you put up a posting about postcards?

230
00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:04.843
Do your job!

231
00:14:08.513 --> 00:14:10.373
None of you can go home.

232
00:14:10.542 --> 00:14:13.483
If you come up with something Soo Ho declines,

233
00:14:14.243 --> 00:14:16.082
then I'll kill you.

234
00:14:28.192 --> 00:14:30.032
Hey. I thought...

235
00:14:30.192 --> 00:14:31.733
he changed personalities...

236
00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:33.402
after his trip.

237
00:14:33.633 --> 00:14:35.432
It was all a show!

238
00:14:35.932 --> 00:14:39.402
He's back to being a lunatic.

239
00:14:39.702 --> 00:14:41.873
His good personality only lasted a month.

240
00:14:42.243 --> 00:14:43.613
I want to quit.

241
00:14:45.213 --> 00:14:46.782
It's too difficult.

242
00:14:47.412 --> 00:14:49.213
Don't be like that.

243
00:14:49.213 --> 00:14:52.123
After 3 weeks, it will be 3 months.

244
00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:54.623
If you last 3months, it'd be 3 years already.

245
00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:00.763
Gosh. That lunatic.

246
00:15:01.763 --> 00:15:04.263
What happened with Soo Ho yesterday?

247
00:15:47.442 --> 00:15:49.113
Your first radio show is airing today, right?

248
00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:50.442
How was the recording...

249
00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:58.322
Soo Ho.

250
00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:00.322
How much...

251
00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:04.322
do you plan to change?

252
00:16:05.192 --> 00:16:08.032
How big a change is it to have a drink?

253
00:16:08.493 --> 00:16:09.633
Why are you here?

254
00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:14.473
You insisted on doing it, so don't let it hurt me.

255
00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.802
I came to tell you that.

256
00:16:16.302 --> 00:16:18.373
If you're going to do it, do it right.

257
00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:21.273
- Can you do that? - I should.

258
00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.113
Please leave. I need to go to the show soon.

259
00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:28.383
You drive today.

260
00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:29.753
Sure.

261
00:16:35.753 --> 00:16:37.422
Did you speak with the station manager...

262
00:16:37.422 --> 00:16:38.893
regarding Jin Tae Ri?

263
00:16:38.922 --> 00:16:41.662
Yes, I called him. He said he understood.

264
00:16:47.032 --> 00:16:51.042
Jay! Look at all the articles about us.

265
00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:54.003
"The top idol Jay's transformation into a DJ."

266
00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:57.942
- Did you dye your hair? - Is it okay?

267
00:16:57.942 --> 00:16:59.442
It's awesome.

268
00:17:01.052 --> 00:17:02.812
Okay, everyone. Gather round.

269
00:17:02.952 --> 00:17:04.182
- Hello. - Yes, sir.

270
00:17:04.582 --> 00:17:06.852
She's our writer, he's our production director,

271
00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:08.352
and she's our DJ.

272
00:17:08.592 --> 00:17:10.822
- And she is? - Our guest.

273
00:17:11.122 --> 00:17:13.263
Pardon? "Our guest"?

274
00:17:13.292 --> 00:17:15.763
- Say hi. - There was no mention...

275
00:17:15.763 --> 00:17:17.392
of a guest.

276
00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.903
Hi. I'm Jin Tae Ri. You know me, right?

277
00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:24.473
Why would we have a loser for our guest?

278
00:17:25.473 --> 00:17:28.042
What? Hey, lady.

279
00:17:28.473 --> 00:17:31.612
I'm standing here. I hear everything.

280
00:17:34.243 --> 00:17:35.753
Oh, my gosh.

281
00:17:38.253 --> 00:17:40.183
What are you doing?

282
00:17:40.523 --> 00:17:42.693
JH's CEO asked me herself.

283
00:17:43.552 --> 00:17:46.062
JH is the reason we're starting nice and big.

284
00:17:46.062 --> 00:17:48.092
We should do this much.

285
00:17:49.132 --> 00:17:51.632
She looks stubborn.

286
00:17:55.632 --> 00:17:58.703
Hello, Jin Tae Ri. I'm the writer, La La Hee.

287
00:18:00.173 --> 00:18:03.413
I expected to join Soo Ho's show.

288
00:18:03.673 --> 00:18:06.243
- Is this old lady good? - Old... Old...

289
00:18:09.312 --> 00:18:10.782
She is good... This "old lady".

290
00:18:12.253 --> 00:18:14.592
Jay. Don't you know me?

291
00:18:15.592 --> 00:18:18.292
I won a best child actor award in 98.

292
00:18:20.322 --> 00:18:22.433
I was born in 99, so...

293
00:18:26.032 --> 00:18:29.003
It looks like I'll have a lot to teach you.

294
00:18:29.032 --> 00:18:30.102
Look.

295
00:18:35.142 --> 00:18:36.413
A selfie with Jay.

296
00:18:36.542 --> 00:18:38.582
Oh, my. My face is smaller.

297
00:18:39.112 --> 00:18:41.183
I'm going on the radio.

298
00:18:43.552 --> 00:18:47.122
Yes. Is this the teacher from Dongchon...

299
00:18:47.122 --> 00:18:49.223
who posted a story on our website?

300
00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:52.693
Yes. Are you free now for a telephone interview?

301
00:18:52.763 --> 00:18:55.493
I'm preparing a graduation event.

302
00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.562
Can we speak later?

303
00:18:57.562 --> 00:19:00.632
Sure, I understand. I'll call later.

304
00:19:00.832 --> 00:19:02.003
Okay.

305
00:19:08.072 --> 00:19:09.243
Jin Tae Ri?

306
00:19:11.882 --> 00:19:13.483
Jin Tae Ri, right?

307
00:19:13.683 --> 00:19:15.013
You were the child actress in...

308
00:19:15.013 --> 00:19:16.352
"Love is An Emergency Landing".

309
00:19:16.753 --> 00:19:18.923
Oh, my gosh. Who are you?

310
00:19:19.023 --> 00:19:22.892
You won an award for that in 98, right? Didn't you?

311
00:19:23.493 --> 00:19:24.993
I haven't seen you in a while.

312
00:19:24.993 --> 00:19:26.463
Funny seeing you here.

313
00:19:27.362 --> 00:19:29.292
Can we take a picture?

314
00:19:29.733 --> 00:19:32.463
Sure, if you want.

315
00:19:32.832 --> 00:19:34.062
Thank you.

316
00:19:40.443 --> 00:19:43.572
I've been a fan ever since your child acting days.

317
00:19:43.673 --> 00:19:46.612
I used to cry along with you every time,

318
00:19:46.782 --> 00:19:48.983
although I don't own a TV and don't watch much now.

319
00:19:49.282 --> 00:19:51.782
Do you want my autograph? My phone number?

320
00:19:52.023 --> 00:19:53.322
Do you mean it?

321
00:19:54.082 --> 00:19:55.193
Well...

322
00:19:55.892 --> 00:19:57.322
Just a minute.

323
00:19:58.163 --> 00:19:59.392
Yes, Mr. Lee.

324
00:20:00.923 --> 00:20:04.703
Ji Soo Ho is here? I'll be right there.

325
00:20:05.263 --> 00:20:07.872
I'm terribly sorry. I'll see you around.

326
00:20:11.572 --> 00:20:12.642
Ji Soo Ho?

327
00:20:21.183 --> 00:20:24.213
If my show doesn't succeed,

328
00:20:24.213 --> 00:20:25.753
I'll quit.

329
00:20:26.153 --> 00:20:28.552
Please, that's what I want.

330
00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:30.953
I've never lost once.

331
00:20:31.963 --> 00:20:33.193
Like I have?

332
00:20:39.933 --> 00:20:43.203
Why are you two still out here? We have 10.

333
00:20:49.473 --> 00:20:50.842
Soo Ho, just a minute.

334
00:20:52.142 --> 00:20:54.753
About today's show...

335
00:20:55.983 --> 00:20:58.122
I'll kill you.

336
00:21:00.223 --> 00:21:02.423
I just want to wish you luck.

337
00:21:06.622 --> 00:21:07.993
Let's go.

338
00:21:09.062 --> 00:21:10.693
Go ahead.

I'm sure if you do...

341
00:21:22.042 --> 00:21:25.413
as you've prepared again, the show will do well.

342

Good luck.

Here's a request from 0827.

344
00:22:04.352 --> 00:22:07.253
"My boyfriend keeps asking me to go away,"

345
00:22:07.483 --> 00:22:09.753
"but I don't know how to ask my parents."

"My dad is super strict..."

"and won't let me take an overnight trip."

You must be torn between your boyfriend...

and your father.

What should I do?

My boyfriend wants to break up if I don't go.

360

Yes, well... Conversation is important...

in all relationships. You're an adult too,

362
00:22:54.163 --> 00:22:57.173
so why don't you discuss it with your father?

363
00:22:57.703 --> 00:22:59.572
You punk! Who are you?

364
00:23:00.173 --> 00:23:02.673
Why do you keep calling my daughter?

365
00:23:04.042 --> 00:23:05.483
Shouldn't we disconnect?

Well... So... That's not it.

That's not what? What's your name?

Why are you calling my teenage daughter...

369

and hitting on her?

370
00:23:25.602 --> 00:23:29.003
Stay calm. Explain that you're on the radio.

371

Well, sir. I'm a DJ...

372

Don't give me no "sir" garbage.

373
00:23:34.142 --> 00:23:36.642
Don't you dare call again.

374
00:23:36.842 --> 00:23:39.112
I'll boil you in hot water...

- Oh no. - and pull out all your...

376

I'll play billiards with your eyeballs.

377
00:23:49.223 --> 00:23:51.562
How could you play billiards with my eyes?

378
00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:55.562
I'll drain the color from your eyes, you jerk!

379

Don't you guys communicate?

413

You should talk to each other.

I'm waiting for the day...

509
00:34:59.622 --> 00:35:02.233
you'll sit here and talk to me seriously.

510
00:35:02.292 --> 00:35:04.363
I'm playing hard to get.

511
00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:05.762
Don't look for me.

512
00:35:13.642 --> 00:35:15.542
You punk! Who are you?

513
00:35:16.343 --> 00:35:18.283
- That's not it. - What's your name?

514
00:35:18.343 --> 00:35:19.783
If you ever call her again...

515
00:35:28.753 --> 00:35:30.722
"A contract is based on mutual trust."

516

"It's a document that proves an agreement."

517
00:35:33.722 --> 00:35:34.792
Don't you know that?

518
00:35:36.892 --> 00:35:39.903
If you get on my nerves in my booth,

519
00:35:40.403 --> 00:35:41.602
I will murder you.

520
00:35:54.753 --> 00:35:57.653
Please pick up if I call.

521
00:36:13.262 --> 00:36:14.432
Hey, Seventh Year.

522
00:36:16.102 --> 00:36:17.633
I hear you were fired.

523
00:36:18.372 --> 00:36:19.472
Pardon?

524
00:36:20.773 --> 00:36:22.213
Aren't you angry?

525
00:36:23.142 --> 00:36:26.383
Geu Rim is doing well after winning over a guy.

526
00:36:26.843 --> 00:36:28.912
When will you guys ever be main writers?

527
00:36:34.653 --> 00:36:36.093
Go buy me a sandwich.

528
00:36:36.153 --> 00:36:38.262
I have no one to run errands for me now...

529

with Geu Rim gone.

530
00:36:48.633 --> 00:36:49.932
Hi.

531
00:37:03.483 --> 00:37:05.423
I heard you wanted me.

532
00:37:05.452 --> 00:37:06.523
Sit down.

533
00:37:06.852 --> 00:37:10.693

536

Yes? How may I help you?

537
00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:25.602
That.

538
00:37:26.073 --> 00:37:28.343

539

540

What choice do I have?

541
00:37:38.622 --> 00:37:41.792

544
00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:00.903
It isn't your personal show.

545
00:38:00.903 --> 00:38:02.472
It was disrespectful.

546

- Mishaps are the best. - I bet he was flustered.

Hi, Lady Kamikaze.

550
00:38:34.673 --> 00:38:37.713
I'm mad at Soo Ho, so I'm keeping a distance.

551
00:38:37.713 --> 00:38:39.283
Is something up?

552
00:38:40.582 --> 00:38:43.912
I saw the articles. He messed up big time.

553
00:38:44.352 --> 00:38:45.823
Is he okay?

554
00:38:46.722 --> 00:38:47.992
Yes, he is.

To celebrate, Jay will treat!

558

How many callers are waiting?

559
00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:19.523
Eight.

560

Sinchon is ready, right?

561
00:39:20.883 --> 00:39:23.253
- Okay! - Okay, let's do this!

562

If you know the answer,

563
00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:29.492
Santa is waiting in Sinchon.

564
00:39:29.733 --> 00:39:32.733
He'll give the gift to the first to arrive.

565
00:39:33.033 --> 00:39:35.702
The first question is, how many members...

566
00:39:35.702 --> 00:39:37.403
- are there in my... - For which drama...

567

did I, Jin Tae Ri, win best child actor?

Can you guess?

569
00:39:42.042 --> 00:39:44.312
What? What is she doing?

570
00:39:45.943 --> 00:39:47.883
- Okay. - I knew it.

571
00:39:48.153 --> 00:39:51.553
- Darn it. - Ji Soo Ho was in it too.

572
00:39:51.553 --> 00:39:55.023
We were like Yeo Jin Goo and Kim So Hyun back then.

573
00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:04.633
Okay. Highlight, correct.

574
00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:07.262
4422. You got it right.

575
00:40:07.262 --> 00:40:09.472
- Darn it. - If you go to Sinchon...

576
00:40:09.472 --> 00:40:11.503

I crave a drink every single day.

606

I can't even count how many main writers...

607
00:41:39.093 --> 00:41:40.662
we have above me.

608
00:41:41.363 --> 00:41:43.162
Do you know whose fault it is...

609
00:41:43.633 --> 00:41:45.233
that we're treated like this?

610
00:41:45.262 --> 00:41:47.233
Why? Whose fault is it?

611
00:41:51.202 --> 00:41:52.403
Geu Rim.

612
00:41:54.142 --> 00:41:55.343
That's not right.

613
00:41:56.073 --> 00:41:57.542
Geu Rim...

614
00:41:57.883 --> 00:42:00.283
is playing Santa alone in February.

615
00:42:00.682 --> 00:42:02.182
Don't you pity her?

616
00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:04.983
Then she should just go to JH.

617
00:42:04.983 --> 00:42:06.983
They have a lot of writers.

618
00:42:07.823 --> 00:42:10.352
JH seems to have her back.

619
00:42:11.093 --> 00:42:12.662
What do you mean?

620
00:42:13.363 --> 00:42:16.492
Well, they wrote a separate contract,

621
00:42:16.992 --> 00:42:19.303
and she's always going to JH's office.

622
00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:20.303
Hey.

623
00:42:20.303 --> 00:42:23.303
If you don't know, just keep your mouth shut.

624
00:42:24.803 --> 00:42:27.343

625
00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:30.812

00:43:13.082 --> 00:43:15.253
Ta-da. Here.

627
00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.062
Here.

628
00:43:25.303 --> 00:43:28.633
Why is the writer who won over Ji Soo Ho sulking?

629
00:43:31.102 --> 00:43:32.202
Well,

630
00:43:32.602 --> 00:43:35.142
I just can't figure out life.

631
00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:36.912
What do you mean?

632
00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:41.153
I mean, I finally became a main writer,

633
00:43:41.613 --> 00:43:44.182
but I can't do the show with my writing,

634
00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:47.122
and the other writers are growing distant.

635
00:43:48.452 --> 00:43:51.463
Even today, I was exhausted...

636
00:43:51.463 --> 00:43:53.363
from playing Santa all day,

637
00:43:53.963 --> 00:43:55.593
but these things warm me up.

638
00:43:57.903 --> 00:43:58.963
Sir.

639
00:43:59.332 --> 00:44:01.773
Why does life flip flop so much?

640
00:44:02.303 --> 00:44:04.943
It's sweet, then bitter. Why is that? Why?

641
00:44:05.273 --> 00:44:07.972
Stop acting so old, discussing life like that.

642
00:44:09.512 --> 00:44:10.542
Is it old?

643
00:44:10.542 --> 00:44:12.812
Commenting about life at every hurdle...

644
00:44:12.812 --> 00:44:15.613
is crazy old, you know.

645
00:44:17.823 --> 00:44:21.523
Come on. You never take my side even once.

646
00:44:22.892 --> 00:44:24.463
Wait for me.

647
00:44:33.762 --> 00:44:37.173
Why do the senior writers all write so well?

648
00:44:40.573 --> 00:44:42.412
If I write in a room like this,

649
00:44:42.412 --> 00:44:44.983
I'd probably get super inspired...

650
00:44:45.042 --> 00:44:47.113
and write very well.

651
00:44:47.582 --> 00:44:48.812
As if.

652
00:44:50.783 --> 00:44:52.452
Wouldn't it be so nice...

653
00:44:52.452 --> 00:44:54.523
if my team could do our show here?

654
00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.852
Did you listen to my show yesterday?

655
00:44:57.492 --> 00:44:59.823
Yesterday was too hectic.

656
00:45:00.162 --> 00:45:02.292
We had the mishap on our show too.

657
00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:06.432
10-year fan? That's all useless, right?

Come on. That's not true.

Did you know how the Post-It was invented?

660
00:45:15.113 --> 00:45:17.343
The Post-It was a failed product...

661
00:45:17.343 --> 00:45:20.542
while trying to make strong adhesive.

662
00:45:21.613 --> 00:45:24.682
It was a failure that became a hit.

663

Geu Rim.

664
00:45:28.452 --> 00:45:31.062
Keep jumping into things you think are failures...

665
00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:34.292
so that you can turn failures into hits.

675
00:46:53.542 --> 00:46:55.573
You can't go in.

676
00:46:57.542 --> 00:46:59.383
Ms. Nam, I was a big hit today.

677
00:46:59.812 --> 00:47:01.012
I even made it to the top of the search engine.

678
00:47:01.012 --> 00:47:02.312
Did you listen to the radio?

679
00:47:14.762 --> 00:47:16.863
How is this dress on me...

680
00:47:17.062 --> 00:47:18.503
for the next JH donation party?

681
00:47:19.332 --> 00:47:20.363
It's in two weeks, right?

682
00:47:21.202 --> 00:47:22.573
Won't you buy it as a gift for me...

683
00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:23.903
so I can wear it?

684
00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:26.403
Excuse me.

685
00:47:28.113 --> 00:47:29.113
Yes?

686
00:47:29.312 --> 00:47:31.713
From here to here.

687
00:47:31.713 --> 00:47:33.483
Okay, I'll prepare them.

688
00:47:38.383 --> 00:47:39.452
They're for you.

689
00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:43.392
I better change department stores.

690
00:47:43.392 --> 00:47:44.662
This place isn't very good.

691
00:47:51.832 --> 00:47:53.633
What are you trying to do?

692
00:47:55.202 --> 00:47:56.803
Don't inconvenience him.

693
00:47:57.233 --> 00:47:58.943
Director Kim Sang Soo will come in 10 minutes.

694
00:47:58.943 --> 00:47:59.943
Sit down.

695
00:48:00.602 --> 00:48:02.412
Also, quit the radio show.

696
00:48:02.773 --> 00:48:03.872
You must know why...

697
00:48:03.872 --> 00:48:05.912
even if I don't tell you.

698
00:48:12.883 --> 00:48:14.523
Take it easy, son.

699
00:48:16.492 --> 00:48:18.662
I'm here because of you.

700
00:48:18.963 --> 00:48:20.363
The reality show...

701
00:48:20.523 --> 00:48:22.992
won't last longer than a month.

702
00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:25.803
Just a month.

703
00:48:25.963 --> 00:48:27.633
Then, we'll be comfortable for a year.

704
00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:29.472
Okay?

705
00:48:29.733 --> 00:48:30.733
Let's eat.

706
00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:39.883
Whose phone is that?

707
00:48:40.213 --> 00:48:41.613
That's not your ringtone.

708
00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:46.222
(Mom)

709
00:48:50.492 --> 00:48:51.892
Did you buy a phone?

710
00:48:52.823 --> 00:48:53.823
No.

711
00:49:01.773 --> 00:49:03.702
(Mom)

712
00:49:08.012 --> 00:49:09.012
Hello?

713
00:49:10.972 --> 00:49:11.983
What?

714
00:49:16.452 --> 00:49:17.722
One moment.

715
00:49:44.443 --> 00:49:46.312
Excuse me.

716
00:49:49.352 --> 00:49:51.582
I'm the guy you talked to on the phone.

717
00:49:52.182 --> 00:49:53.753
I'm Geu Rim's friend.

718
00:50:09.102 --> 00:50:11.303
Can we listen to the radio?

719
00:50:17.042 --> 00:50:19.542
Have you calmed down?

720
00:50:20.443 --> 00:50:23.383
Yes. My bag was snatched away so suddenly.

721
00:50:23.783 --> 00:50:26.122
It's not my first time,

722
00:50:26.222 --> 00:50:28.823
but I was nervous without my wallet.

723
00:50:29.023 --> 00:50:30.153
Thank you so much.

724
00:50:32.122 --> 00:50:33.122
By the way,

725
00:50:33.562 --> 00:50:36.292
did you listen to Geu Rim's show yesterday?

726
00:50:37.633 --> 00:50:38.702
Yes.

727
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:41.733
Ji Soo Ho was so cute.

728
00:50:42.702 --> 00:50:45.073
He seems like the DJ on her show.

729
00:50:45.073 --> 00:50:47.273
He must be a rude jerk.

730
00:51:00.722 --> 00:51:02.292
I'll help...

731
00:51:13.233 --> 00:51:15.133
I'll...

732
00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.242
I thought...

733
00:51:20.403 --> 00:51:22.542
you couldn't climb stairs on your own.

734
00:51:24.512 --> 00:51:25.883
It was a lie.

735
00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.383
I wanted to hold your hand...

736
00:51:27.383 --> 00:51:29.153
and make you dinner.

737
00:51:30.053 --> 00:51:31.283
Sit down.

738
00:51:31.283 --> 00:51:33.622
I really want to make you some food.

739
00:51:36.253 --> 00:51:37.253
But...

740
00:52:05.283 --> 00:52:07.523
Are you staring at me in amazement?

741
00:52:08.023 --> 00:52:10.153
No. No, ma'am.

742
00:52:10.153 --> 00:52:11.593
When you can't see,

743
00:52:11.593 --> 00:52:14.122
there are a lot more you can see.

744
00:52:15.363 --> 00:52:16.992
Since I can't see,

745
00:52:16.992 --> 00:52:18.733
I can tell...

746
00:52:18.733 --> 00:52:22.033
what a wonderful voice my daughter's friend has.

747
00:52:23.602 --> 00:52:26.972
You can smell kindness from kind people.

748
00:52:27.472 --> 00:52:28.512
In life,

749
00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.642
you might lose one, but gain much more.

750
00:52:30.843 --> 00:52:32.642
Now, sit down.

751
00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:35.682
Sit and eat. Come on.

752
00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.193
Enjoy your food.

753
00:52:43.523 --> 00:52:44.992
I'm a pretty good cook.

754
00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:46.762
Go on.

755
00:52:54.972 --> 00:52:56.102
Ji Soo Ho.

756
00:52:56.633 --> 00:52:58.102
- Why... - Geu Rim.

757
00:52:58.102 --> 00:53:00.742
I became best friends with the jerk.

758
00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:03.713
Mom.

759
00:53:05.283 --> 00:53:06.883
What are you talking about?

760
00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:09.553
Soo Ho isn't a jerk...

761
00:53:09.783 --> 00:53:10.812
He is, isn't he?

762
00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:12.053
No.

763
00:53:16.222 --> 00:53:18.823
Here. Have some.

764
00:53:19.222 --> 00:53:20.222
Thank you.

765
00:53:28.233 --> 00:53:29.233
Here.

766
00:53:30.872 --> 00:53:32.273
Thank you, honey.

767
00:53:46.352 --> 00:53:47.553
That smells good.

768
00:53:48.622 --> 00:53:50.753
Mother, I want some soup.

769
00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:51.863
Come in.

770
00:53:53.323 --> 00:53:54.323
What?

771
00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.253
Have some of this.

772
00:54:27.622 --> 00:54:28.633
Right.

773
00:54:29.392 --> 00:54:30.562
Mother.

774
00:54:33.932 --> 00:54:35.432
I was going to give it to you after dinner,

775
00:54:36.403 --> 00:54:37.673
but this is the new edition.

776
00:54:39.803 --> 00:54:41.472
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

777
00:54:41.472 --> 00:54:43.113
Don't call me that.

778
00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.242
We always eat together.

779
00:54:44.242 --> 00:54:45.483
We're like a mom and a son.

780
00:54:46.542 --> 00:54:47.582
Really?

781
00:54:54.153 --> 00:54:56.553
After this, we'll have tea at my place.

782
00:54:56.553 --> 00:54:57.823
- Okay. - Okay.

783
00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:12.202
Due to yoga and herbal tea,

784
00:55:12.443 --> 00:55:15.312
my mind is at ease.

785
00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:18.213
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

786
00:55:20.512 --> 00:55:22.783
Newbie, where's the script?

787
00:55:23.113 --> 00:55:25.823
Hold on. I'll bring it over now.

788
00:55:30.452 --> 00:55:33.062
Are we going to go live tomorrow too?

789
00:55:33.693 --> 00:55:35.332
You were born to DJ live.

790
00:55:35.792 --> 00:55:37.033
Thanks to you,

791
00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:38.803
our show will get the most number of listeners.

792
00:55:39.303 --> 00:55:40.503
What if I refuse?

793
00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:42.403
You wouldn't.

794
00:55:43.033 --> 00:55:46.273
I know a little about you,

795
00:55:46.273 --> 00:55:48.113
and you don't have the guts.

796
00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:50.673
You can't inconvenience others.

797
00:55:50.713 --> 00:55:52.542
Especially if it's something you promised.

798
00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:56.553
Let's see. What else? It's also on the contract.

799
00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:59.823
You don't have the guts to go against it.

800
00:55:59.952 --> 00:56:01.492
You remember what you said, right?

801
00:56:01.852 --> 00:56:04.352
You'll quit if I don't like the proposal.

802
00:56:04.662 --> 00:56:07.562
I'm still allowed to leave after a month of trial.

803
00:56:08.162 --> 00:56:10.162
- Soo Ho. - What?

804
00:56:11.733 --> 00:56:13.903
This plant's name is Soo Ho.

805
00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:17.173
It's our guardian angel for the radio.

806
00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:19.343
Soo Ho.

807
00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:22.073
You need to watch your temper.

808
00:56:22.213 --> 00:56:24.383
That's the only way you can grow big.

809
00:56:27.512 --> 00:56:28.613
Mr. Lee.

810
00:56:28.783 --> 00:56:32.283
This is the segment and the opening.

811
00:56:34.792 --> 00:56:35.992
Not bad.

812
00:56:36.423 --> 00:56:39.262
Although, I'm not sure if they will select it.

813
00:56:39.693 --> 00:56:40.963
I'll get going.

814
00:56:41.463 --> 00:56:44.133
Here. This is the scarf you lent me before.

815
00:56:45.863 --> 00:56:48.602
You were the owner of that scarf?

816
00:56:49.202 --> 00:56:50.432
No wonder.

817
00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.242
You need to fix the opening.

818
00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:57.673
- Tonight, we'll work... - No.

819
00:56:58.943 --> 00:57:01.012
I need your help with training tonight.

820
00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:05.582
Excuse me.

821
00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:07.952
Mother.

822
00:57:09.352 --> 00:57:12.292
Could I borrow your daughter tonight?

823
00:57:32.812 --> 00:57:35.883
Hey. Soo Ho.

824
00:57:35.883 --> 00:57:39.352
I'm worried about tomorrow.

825
00:57:41.492 --> 00:57:42.792
Right.

826
00:57:43.153 --> 00:57:46.093
I'm always nervous when we go on live.

827
00:57:46.492 --> 00:57:49.033
So, teach me.

828
00:57:57.033 --> 00:58:00.642
Sure. I'll teach you well.

829
00:58:06.682 --> 00:58:08.812
Do you know the electric wave equation?

830
00:58:10.082 --> 00:58:12.753
We cannot see it, but a reflective layer...

831
00:58:12.753 --> 00:58:15.722
is sitting in the sky. This is what makes it...

832
00:58:15.722 --> 00:58:17.193
possible for us to do radio shows.

833
00:58:18.323 --> 00:58:21.463
Radio sounds...

834
00:58:21.492 --> 00:58:23.593
turn into light in the sky.

835
00:58:23.762 --> 00:58:25.602
Like so. Sparkle.

836
00:58:27.202 --> 00:58:30.403
That's why the sounds we make on the radio...

837
00:58:30.602 --> 00:58:33.073
become lights somewhere in the sky.

838
00:58:33.972 --> 00:58:36.173
Sounds sent in by our listeners,

839
00:58:36.213 --> 00:58:39.542
and the sounds you and I make in the booth...

840
00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:42.383
are shining in the sky.

841
00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:44.923
This is radio.

842
00:58:45.952 --> 00:58:48.392
We make sounds turn into light.

843
00:58:55.233 --> 00:58:58.733
This is the legendary booth of 40 years.

844
00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:02.372
You saw it in the video I sent you, right?

845
00:59:15.613 --> 00:59:16.912
My mom...

846
00:59:17.753 --> 00:59:20.722
got her eye surgery when I was 14 years old.

847
00:59:22.622 --> 00:59:24.963
Ever since then, I left the television off.

848
00:59:27.693 --> 00:59:29.662
I didn't want to laugh or cry...

849
00:59:29.863 --> 00:59:32.702
while seeing a world my mom couldn't see.

850
00:59:34.102 --> 00:59:35.733
That's how I felt when I was young.

851
00:59:38.372 --> 00:59:42.073
Instead, the radio was always on at home.

852
00:59:43.542 --> 00:59:46.542
I wanted to hear the world she was hearing.

853
00:59:47.182 --> 00:59:50.883
But I fell in love after a while.

854
00:59:51.423 --> 00:59:54.653
All of the stories were relatable.

855
00:59:54.792 --> 00:59:56.253
I felt like they were my stories.

856
00:59:57.722 --> 00:59:59.863
That's how I was consoled.

857
01:00:00.423 --> 01:00:02.633
I learned to cheer up.

858
01:00:21.213 --> 01:00:23.082
On radio,

859
01:00:23.082 --> 01:00:25.783
seven seconds of silence is considered an accident.

860
01:00:25.983 --> 01:00:28.292
That's when we must play a song on standby first.

861
01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:32.222
You didn't say anything for seven seconds then.

862
01:00:32.622 --> 01:00:35.193
That's a really long time on the radio.

863
01:00:35.392 --> 01:00:36.463
Here.

864
01:00:36.963 --> 01:00:40.533
Stay silent for seven seconds.

865
01:01:08.492 --> 01:01:09.932
It feels long, right?

866
01:01:11.303 --> 01:01:13.363
That's why you must not go silent.

867
01:01:14.162 --> 01:01:17.233
When you're startled, just press this.

868
01:01:20.142 --> 01:01:23.472
The DJ can play the music from here. Got it?

869
01:01:26.912 --> 01:01:30.113
Also, I noticed that you saw the email.

870
01:01:31.182 --> 01:01:32.323
Yes.

871
01:01:34.153 --> 01:01:35.992
How was the manuscript?

872
01:01:37.153 --> 01:01:39.262
I mean... Did you read it?

873
01:01:39.523 --> 01:01:41.262
Yes, I did.

874
01:01:42.162 --> 01:01:43.593
I passed the first step.

875
01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.443
I'm curious...

876
01:02:33.242 --> 01:02:34.242
about you.

877
01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:13.753
(Radio Romance)

878
01:03:13.753 --> 01:03:15.352
We're going to find some sponsors.

879
01:03:15.352 --> 01:03:17.292
The one that scores can have his way.

880
01:03:17.292 --> 01:03:18.463
Isn't it strange?

881
01:03:18.463 --> 01:03:22.233
Why are they sponsoring us instead of their son?

882
01:03:22.593 --> 01:03:24.332
I'm going to use Soo Ho in every way I can.

883
01:03:24.332 --> 01:03:27.972
I know his past, and you have the evidence.

884
01:03:28.273 --> 01:03:31.343
There must be an accident. We're stuck.

885
01:03:31.343 --> 01:03:33.102
Get to the nearby transmitting station.

886
01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.872
I don't think we can air. I'm sorry.

887
01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:38.142
I'm curious about something.
