3
00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:11.635
I decline the position of Haesung Apparel president,

4
00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:12.946
Grandfather.

5
00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:15.405
Do Kyung,

6
00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.315
How dare you...

7
00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:20.686
Mr. No.

8
00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:23.285
Mr. No. Mr. No.

9
00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:25.616
Mr. No. Mr. No.

10
00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.126
Mr. No, look at me.

11
00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:31.225
Mr. No. Mr. No. Mr. No.

12
00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:32.995
Mr. No.

13
00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.306
Let's go.

14
00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:50.715
Okay.

15
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:53.516
Let's go.

16
00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.535
What's taking them so long?

17
00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:21.505
What if they're crying over their last goodbye?

18
00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:23.815
Maybe we shouldn't have followed here.

19
00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:27.815
By the way,

20
00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:31.055
why did you think it's their last?

21
00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:36.996
I'll make you experience a real extreme sport.

22
00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:44.665
Is this really necessary?

23
00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.236
Today is their last day together.

24
00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:49.576
I don't want Ji An to go home alone.

25
00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.936
I can't do that.

26
00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.906
It may not be their last.

27
00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.175
Yes, it is.

28
00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.915
I know Ji An. It's their last day.

29
00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:03.016
I now see how much they love each other.

30
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:06.326
Choi Do Kyung started his business.

31
00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:09.826
Father may support them like us.

32
00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.425
When I lived at their house,

33
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.935
I ran away from the foundation day event,

34
00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:19.296
and they scolded me so harsh...

35
00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.566
that I lived the way they wanted me to.

36
00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.976
I don't ever want to do that again.

37
00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:27.905
Is that so?

38
00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:32.245
Ji An will be worse at it.

39
00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:36.016
Besides, Do Kyung and I aren't the same.

40
00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.316
Do Kyung is the heir of Haesung Corporation.

41
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:42.655
Are you sure he's planning to go back?

42
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:45.925
It seems he's enjoying his work at the factory.

43
00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:49.935
He doesn't want to return after losing to Grandpa,

44
00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:51.266
but he will go back one day.

45
00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:54.606
Ji An and Do Kyung both know that.

46
00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:57.136
That's why they decided to date only for a week.

47
00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.076
I heard it from Ji An.

48
00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:01.576
Grandpa visited my parents in Daebang-dong...

49
00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:03.175
and met with Dad.

50
00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:05.946
Mother tried to separate them...

51
00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:07.685
and pretended to approve of their marriage.

52
00:03:10.215 --> 00:03:14.256
Do you think she'd be happy with such family?

53
00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:20.266
That's why they reached this kind of decision.

54
00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:26.706
Hey. Here they come.

55
00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.715
Drop me off at a subway station on your way.

56
00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:40.845
Okay, I will.

57
00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:43.286
Hold on.

58
00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:47.425
This is Ms. Min. Let me get this quickly.

59
00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:52.356
- Hello? - Mr. Choi.

60
00:03:52.655 --> 00:03:55.766
Mr. No had a heart attack and is at a hospital.

61
00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:57.835
Grandpa did?

62
00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.066
Why so suddenly? How did that happen?

63
00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:03.706
According to Ms. Jung,

64
00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:06.036
he collapsed after reading your text message.

65
00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:07.805
My text message?

66
00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:11.446
He went into surgery right away. Come quickly.

67
00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:13.986
Okay. I'll call you on my way there.

68
00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:17.016
What happened?

69
00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:21.926
It... It's Grandpa. He collapsed.

70
00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.196
I must get to the hospital now.

71
00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:33.566
Do Kyung, are you okay? Should I drive?

72
00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.876
Ji An! Do Kyung!

73
00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.545
- Ji An. - Ji Soo.

74
00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:42.275
Hyuk and I came here for sledding.

75
00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:43.576
This is all a coincidence.

76
00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.645
But is there something wrong?

77
00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.645
Well, that's...

78
00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:50.516
His grandfather collapsed.

79
00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:54.456
Do Kyung, you must hurry. But can you drive?

80
00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:55.655
Yes.

81
00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:58.295
Ji Soo, drop off Ji An for me.

82
00:04:58.595 --> 00:04:59.665
Okay.

83
00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:08.636
Hurry. Don't worry about me.

84
00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:34.926
He had a heart attack, so they're inserting a stent.

85
00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:37.395
If he's still unconscious after that,

86
00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:39.806
he must go through therapeutic hypothermia.

87
00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.436
He even had a heart attack?

88
00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:44.636
He fell unconscious after reading my text?

89
00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:51.345
(Coffee)

90
00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:56.045
(President of Haesung Apparel: Choi Do Kyung)

91
00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.006
(To Grandpa, I'm...)

92
00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:23.215
(Operating Room)

93
00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:26.116
Myung Hee, where is Jae Sung?

94
00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:27.446
Why isn't he here?

95
00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:29.246
He's on a trip.

96
00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:31.855
Does that mean he can't answer his phone?

97
00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:34.785
Or does he not want to answer it?

98
00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:36.655
Let's stay quiet.

99
00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:40.926
But...

100
00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:43.035
what does Do Kyung mean by this text?

101
00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:45.496
Is he going to be completely independent?

102
00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:50.405
Myung Soo, Dad is in surgery.

103
00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:51.905
Is that what interests you now?

104
00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:04.215
Send her away.

105
00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.355
Why did she send them Do Kyung's text?

106
00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:12.326
She said she won't go no matter what.

107
00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:25.376
Mom, is the surgery over?

108
00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:26.605
Not yet.

109
00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:30.316
Do Kyung, why did you send a message like this?

110
00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:32.246
Are you not returning to the company?

111
00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:33.715
Jin Hee.

112
00:07:38.686 --> 00:07:39.785
We need to talk.

113
00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:50.136
Mr. No's surgery has been finished,

114
00:07:50.835 --> 00:07:52.496
but he hasn't regained his consciousness yet.

115
00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:55.535
We transferred him to the ICU for further treatment.

116
00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:59.506
How long will the treatment take?

117
00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.306
We must observe his condition to decide that.

118
00:08:02.676 --> 00:08:05.845
Can't we at least see him?

119
00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:07.246
That's not possible now.

120
00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:09.016
I will let you know after we observe him.

121
00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:12.155
You can go home and wait.

122
00:08:27.405 --> 00:08:30.905
This is weird. Father's phone is still off.

123
00:08:31.076 --> 00:08:32.505
Did he turn it off because he's at the hospital?

124
00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:35.345
I'll leave him a message to call me back.

125
00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:40.845
Ji An, are you okay?

126
00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:43.715
Sorry? Yes, I'm okay.

127
00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:47.026
But poor Do Kyung.

128
00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:51.556
Why did Mr. No collapse? It looked urgent.

129
00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:53.326
I don't know either.

130
00:08:54.865 --> 00:08:56.936
Should I give Do Kyung a call?

131
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.635
No, don't.

132
00:08:58.635 --> 00:09:01.566
Mr. Choi will call you once he sees your message.

133
00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:23.595
Mom.

134
00:09:24.456 --> 00:09:25.495
Dad.

135
00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:28.865
I've never had the chance to hold a service for you.

136
00:09:30.635 --> 00:09:31.936
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:32.835 --> 00:09:34.436
That won't happen from now on.

138
00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:42.206
What brings you here at this late hour?

139
00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:44.146
Hello.

140
00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:47.715
I came for a hike...

141
00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:50.556
and to pay a visit to my parents.

142
00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:53.585
I prepared a room when I heard you were coming.

143
00:10:00.765 --> 00:10:02.526
You were under a lot of stress...

144
00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:05.536
and mistook gastritis symptoms for cancer.

145
00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:08.036
You imagined that you had cancer.

146
00:10:12.776 --> 00:10:16.146
We decided to date for only a week.

147
00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:21.115
I felt it was so unfair to not even date him.

148
00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:24.556
Dad, you know what?

149
00:10:24.686 --> 00:10:26.686
I won the third place...

150
00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:28.725
in a design contest.

151
00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:31.355
She got the prize of 1,000 dollars....

152
00:10:31.595 --> 00:10:34.495
and a chance to study at Onnea Design School...

153
00:10:34.495 --> 00:10:36.865
in Finland for six months.

154
00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:38.166
Why not?

155
00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:41.536
Why don't I have cancer?

156
00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:44.475
Why am I not going to die?

157
00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:54.946
I finished preparing myself for it.

158
00:10:55.946 --> 00:10:58.686
Ending my life now would be great.

159
00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:03.056
(Insurance Policy)

160
00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:04.396
I must die...

161
00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:06.926
for them to claim the policy.

162
00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:12.166
Why are you doing this to me now?

163
00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:14.835
Do you think I'd be happy and grateful because...

164
00:11:14.835 --> 00:11:16.436
you're taking care of me now?

165
00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.276
I also hate you now just like you hate me.

166
00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:21.505
I hate you.

167
00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:23.615
I didn't have my way with my life,

168
00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.475
but I'll choose how I'll die.

169
00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:27.245
After I die,

170
00:11:27.416 --> 00:11:29.885
I don't care if you are heartbroken with remorse.

171
00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:32.686
I don't care at all.

172
00:11:41.595 --> 00:11:44.396
I'll tell the hospital to prevent the news...

173
00:11:44.396 --> 00:11:45.965
of his condition from getting out.

174
00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:49.806
We'll learn more about his state tomorrow morning.

175
00:11:49.806 --> 00:11:50.936
Let us all go home now.

176
00:11:51.936 --> 00:11:53.375
I'll stay here.

177
00:11:55.946 --> 00:11:56.975
See you tomorrow.

178
00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:02.146
See you tomorrow, Myung Hee.

179
00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:05.355
Do Kyung, pray for him.

180
00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:07.225
I'll see you tomorrow.

181
00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:08.755
Goodnight.

182
00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:10.026
Please get home safe.

183
00:12:22.806 --> 00:12:25.776
How dare you send this kind of text to him?

184
00:12:26.306 --> 00:12:29.306
"I'm already a president of DK Eco Tech."

185
00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:30.715
"I decline the position..."

186
00:12:30.715 --> 00:12:32.446
"of Haesung Apparel president, Grandfather?"

187
00:12:34.115 --> 00:12:37.355
Don't you know why he's making you President?

188
00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:41.355
It means he's picked you as his successor.

189
00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:42.826
And you still refused to come back?

190
00:12:42.826 --> 00:12:44.625
Are you giving up Haesung Corporation?

191
00:12:44.896 --> 00:12:46.995
I couldn't just do what he wanted me to do.

192
00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:50.095
It wasn't time yet.

193
00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:52.566
You weren't going to give it up for good,

194
00:12:52.965 --> 00:12:55.265
but yet you tried to outsmart him.

195
00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:00.776
Your father resigned from his position,

196
00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:03.316
and you refused your position as the President.

197
00:13:06.715 --> 00:13:07.816
He heard the rumors...

198
00:13:07.816 --> 00:13:09.385
saying you ran away from home for a woman,

199
00:13:09.385 --> 00:13:12.186
did drugs, and disappeared after leaving the office.

200
00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:13.956
How could he not collapse?

201
00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:15.385
"Rumors"?

202
00:13:19.725 --> 00:13:22.426
(Rumors about H Group)

203
00:13:25.265 --> 00:13:27.235
(His whereabouts are unknown now.)

204
00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:33.676
Grandfather worked so hard to grow this company.

205
00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:36.176
And yet you swung an iron mace at him...

206
00:13:36.176 --> 00:13:38.745
when he had so much faith in you as the heir.

207
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.485
I never imagined that he would collapse.

208
00:13:43.686 --> 00:13:45.115
He's such a strong man.

209
00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:48.926
There's nobody who is actually strong.

210
00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:51.595
Everyone is just pretending to be strong.

211
00:14:03.306 --> 00:14:04.375
Honey.

212
00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:07.406
Why did Do Kyung refuse the position as President?

213
00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:09.515
I wonder too.

214
00:14:10.146 --> 00:14:11.816
The fact that Father is sending me to Europe...

215
00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:13.885
and appointing Do Kyung...

216
00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:15.385
as the President of Haesung Apparel...

217
00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.515
clearly means...

218
00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:19.456
that he chose Do Kyung as his successor.

219
00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:25.426
Perhaps he's really into running his own business?

220
00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:28.666
I'm sure it was fun. It would've been rewarding.

221
00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:31.666
But it can't be compared to Haesung Corporation.

222
00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:34.066
Then why did he turn down the offer?

223
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:37.975
Could that...

224
00:14:38.936 --> 00:14:40.475
really be the reason?

225
00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.015
That's not important.

226
00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:46.416
I never thought he would collapse like this.

227
00:14:48.686 --> 00:14:51.286
I am so puzzled. Let's talk at home.

228
00:15:02.566 --> 00:15:05.135
(Coronary Care Unit)

229
00:15:09.906 --> 00:15:12.475
I can't bring her to a family like this.

230
00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:14.046
And,

231
00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:17.546
I won't go back home either.

232
00:15:19.046 --> 00:15:21.146
Regardless of Ji An, I won't go back.

233
00:15:21.646 --> 00:15:22.686
I...

234
00:15:24.286 --> 00:15:27.526
am no longer your puppy.

235
00:15:50.975 --> 00:15:52.115
Thank you.

236
00:15:55.646 --> 00:15:58.956
I never knew I'd miss this place so much.

237
00:16:06.926 --> 00:16:09.225
If you hear any news, please call me.

238
00:16:09.765 --> 00:16:11.166
Thank you for the ride, Hyuk.

239
00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.196
I'll go in now.

240
00:16:12.635 --> 00:16:15.066
Should I go in for a while too?

241
00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:17.335
I want Mom and Dad to meet Hyuk.

242
00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:21.076
Dad might not be there.

243
00:16:21.776 --> 00:16:23.046
And Mom...

244
00:16:23.845 --> 00:16:25.546
I went to your house the other time,

245
00:16:25.546 --> 00:16:27.916
and the new tenant said you had moved.

246
00:16:29.015 --> 00:16:30.556
It's too late today.

247
00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:32.515
I will visit them next time.

248
00:16:32.615 --> 00:16:35.286
You should go in and meet your mom.

249
00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:38.255
What will you do here alone?

250
00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:40.865
I'll check the online mall while listening to music.

251
00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:41.965
I have a lot to do.

252
00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:45.536
Then will you wait here for a while?

253
00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:47.965
I had something to say to everyone anyway.

254
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.066
Ji Soo should be there too.

255
00:16:57.576 --> 00:16:59.316
- Mom. - Mom.

256
00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:03.085
- Ji Soo. - Mom.

257
00:17:03.286 --> 00:17:04.715
How did you come?

258
00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:06.755
I'm so glad you came.

259
00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:08.356
You look much better now

260
00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:09.525
thanks to your father.

261
00:17:10.725 --> 00:17:13.565
- Ji Soo. - Ji Tae. Soo A.

262
00:17:14.295 --> 00:17:16.465
Ji Soo, you're becoming an aunt soon.

263
00:17:16.896 --> 00:17:18.065
Really?

264
00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:20.436
Congratulations, Soo A. You too, Ji Tae.

265
00:17:20.436 --> 00:17:22.106
Is it a nephew or a niece?

266
00:17:22.106 --> 00:17:23.235
What's his fetus nickname?

267
00:17:23.235 --> 00:17:25.336
We found out only recently.

268
00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:29.146
I have good news too.

269
00:17:31.045 --> 00:17:34.086
Congratulations, Ji An. I'm so happy for you.

270
00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:35.646
It's only a participation prize,

271
00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:37.856
but you're acting like I received a grand prize.

272
00:17:38.285 --> 00:17:40.686
Not everyone can get it. You must've done well.

273
00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:42.225
You are amazing, Ji An.

274
00:17:42.225 --> 00:17:44.055
You just started studying design.

275
00:17:44.055 --> 00:17:46.626
You've been good at art since you were young.

276
00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:48.866
She did it without any help from us.

277
00:17:49.126 --> 00:17:51.795
I usually do everything well by myself.

278
00:17:52.366 --> 00:17:54.265
Are you going to go to Finland then?

279
00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:55.965
Of course I am.

280
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:57.106
The expenses are covered for the three-month...

281
00:17:57.106 --> 00:17:58.136
language course and the six-month program.

282
00:17:58.136 --> 00:17:59.545
It's an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

283
00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:00.745
I am going to work more to afford....

284
00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:01.745
the ticket and the living expenses.

285
00:18:01.805 --> 00:18:03.215
It's nice to see that you won a prize,

286
00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.715
but I don't like to be apart from you.

287
00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:06.985
If you're that sad, you can go with her.

288
00:18:07.416 --> 00:18:09.715
Can you leave Hyuk and come with me?

289
00:18:09.715 --> 00:18:10.785
What?

290
00:18:11.515 --> 00:18:14.285
I am not sure.

291
00:18:28.765 --> 00:18:30.706
(My name is Seo Tae Soo. If you find me...)

292
00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:07.446
Honey,

293
00:19:08.475 --> 00:19:09.916
I am sorry.

294
00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:12.275
I've been bad.

295
00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:15.586
You're my lifetime companion.

296
00:19:16.386 --> 00:19:20.055
But I mistook you as my guardian.

297
00:19:21.626 --> 00:19:23.426
You are only a human too.

298
00:19:24.856 --> 00:19:28.465
When you're tired, you'd want to rest in the shade.

299
00:19:29.366 --> 00:19:31.366
And you needed to be comforted too.

300
00:19:32.366 --> 00:19:34.005
I am sorry for forgetting that.

301
00:19:35.706 --> 00:19:36.906
I hope...

302
00:19:37.836 --> 00:19:39.545
you will forgive me.

303
00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:57.126
(Ji Tae)

304
00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:58.956
When I heard the child's heart beating,

305
00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:01.465
I realized this is how it feels to be a father,

306
00:20:01.465 --> 00:20:03.696
and words couldn't express my feelings.

307
00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:07.505
You must've felt this too, right?

308
00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:01.456
Do Kyung.

309
00:21:04.225 --> 00:21:05.295
You're up early.

310
00:21:05.295 --> 00:21:07.166
How is Grandfather? Is he okay?

311
00:21:07.465 --> 00:21:08.896
Why did you come here?

312
00:21:08.896 --> 00:21:10.866
Did you come back because he's okay?

313
00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:13.735
We have to wait and see.

314
00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:15.765
I came to get changed.

315
00:21:19.075 --> 00:21:20.106
But...

316
00:21:26.545 --> 00:21:27.586
Do Kyung.

317
00:21:30.886 --> 00:21:33.656
Why are you wearing a suit to the factory?

318
00:21:33.656 --> 00:21:34.956
Why did you pack your things?

319
00:21:35.285 --> 00:21:36.525
I need to go into the office.

320
00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:38.956
I will go back home after work.

321
00:21:39.626 --> 00:21:41.565
You're going home?

322
00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:49.336
Wait.

323
00:21:51.475 --> 00:21:53.376
What do you mean you're going into the office?

324
00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:54.775
What about the factory?

325
00:21:54.775 --> 00:21:56.646
I am going because I need to go there.

326
00:21:57.376 --> 00:21:59.075
I was appointed to be President.

327
00:21:59.275 --> 00:22:01.846
Is it a temporary thing? Or are you going for good?

328
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:04.616
I don't think I need to tell you that.

329
00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:07.325
What will happen to the factory then?

330
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.325
It's none of your business.

331
00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:11.225
What are you doing?

332
00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:13.626
Were you just playing House all along?

333
00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:17.265
Ji An was so happy that you're finally...

334
00:22:20.436 --> 00:22:22.666
Ji An wanted to help you run your own business.

335
00:22:22.666 --> 00:22:24.805
Do you know how many people supported you?

336
00:22:25.975 --> 00:22:27.346
I will thank you all next time.

337
00:22:29.975 --> 00:22:31.015
What about Ji An?

338
00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:33.346
What will you say to Ji An?

339
00:22:35.285 --> 00:22:36.815
Does she not matter since you promised...

340
00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:38.055
to date only for a week?

341
00:22:38.755 --> 00:22:39.785
I told you not to start...

342
00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:41.586
if you can't take the responsibility.

343
00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:47.166
Why didn't you stop me?

344
00:22:51.065 --> 00:22:52.166
I won't...

345
00:22:53.065 --> 00:22:54.706
let Ji Soo stay here for long.

346
00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:16.825
Couldn't he at least tell me what's going on?

347
00:23:18.825 --> 00:23:21.295
(Ji Soo)

348
00:23:22.225 --> 00:23:23.336
Yes, Ji Soo.

349
00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:25.995
Ji An, Do Kyung came here,

350
00:23:25.995 --> 00:23:28.166
but he left after saying he's going to the office.

351
00:23:28.336 --> 00:23:29.336
"The office"?

352
00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:32.336
Perhaps something is wrong at the office?

353
00:23:33.075 --> 00:23:34.745
How is the chairman?

354
00:23:35.275 --> 00:23:37.475
He collapsed of myocardial infarction.

355
00:23:37.475 --> 00:23:39.515
He's still at the Intensive care unit.

356
00:23:39.916 --> 00:23:40.985
"Still"?

357
00:23:41.916 --> 00:23:43.886
Let's eat lunch together.

358
00:23:43.886 --> 00:23:45.116
I have something to tell you.

359
00:23:45.485 --> 00:23:46.886
Okay.

360
00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:49.255
I will see you there.

361
00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:54.166
What's going on with him?

362
00:24:02.535 --> 00:24:04.906
It's Do Kyung, isn't it? Is he back?

363
00:24:04.906 --> 00:24:06.305
This is unbelievable.

364
00:24:09.876 --> 00:24:11.846
(Jung Myung Soo)

365
00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:17.956
What?

366
00:24:20.656 --> 00:24:22.856
You're still using this room.

367
00:24:23.156 --> 00:24:24.225
Yes.

368
00:24:24.926 --> 00:24:26.126
What are you doing...

369
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.596
I officially start tomorrow,

370
00:24:30.965 --> 00:24:33.265
but I wanted to come and look around.

371
00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:36.475
You must feel sorry for making...

372
00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:37.505
your grandfather collapse.

373
00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:39.475
Yes.

374
00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:42.206
The guilt is killing me.

375
00:24:43.045 --> 00:24:46.045
I will go look around the departments then.

376
00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:55.126
The vice president's office is still vacant.

377
00:24:55.985 --> 00:24:57.525
Why did he come straight here?

378
00:24:59.725 --> 00:25:01.126
The vice president...

379
00:25:01.565 --> 00:25:03.795
No, he's the president now.

380
00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.636
Has he come to work already?

381
00:25:12.106 --> 00:25:14.575
Mr. Choi.

382
00:25:14.775 --> 00:25:16.146
You look as if you saw a ghost.

383
00:25:16.545 --> 00:25:20.245
You must've heard the news.

384
00:25:25.285 --> 00:25:27.325
Is it because of the rumors you read?

385
00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:29.596
No, it's not.

386
00:25:29.596 --> 00:25:32.866
Who would believe such false rumors?

387
00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:35.225
It seems like you were having a meeting.

388
00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:37.995
Since I am here, please give me an update.

389
00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:39.096
- Sure. - Sure.

390
00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:46.575
Are the plans for the first half going well?

391
00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:49.376
Yes, we are trying to attract new customers...

392
00:25:50.075 --> 00:25:51.475
through strategic marketing...

393
00:25:51.475 --> 00:25:53.086
that puts the focus on the storytelling.

394
00:25:53.315 --> 00:25:55.386
How is the down-aging project coming along?

395
00:25:55.386 --> 00:25:58.315
It's supposed to encompass people from 20 to 50.

396
00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:03.396
I'm glad that he's not in a critical condition.

397
00:26:04.156 --> 00:26:05.356
But aren't you surprised?

398
00:26:05.356 --> 00:26:07.866
He went back to Haesung Corporation.

399
00:26:08.426 --> 00:26:10.696
His grandfather collapsed because of him.

400
00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:12.196
How could he not go back to work?

401
00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:15.065
Besides, he's still in the intensive care unit.

402
00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:17.535
I am worried about the factory.

403
00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:19.336
Mr. Yoo will have to work alone.

404
00:26:19.906 --> 00:26:21.946
Do you think he will come back to the factory...

405
00:26:21.946 --> 00:26:24.775
once Grandfather recovers?

406
00:26:26.146 --> 00:26:27.346
He wanted to go back...

407
00:26:27.346 --> 00:26:29.285
after proving what he can do alone.

408
00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:34.255
You really understand him well, don't you?

409
00:26:34.956 --> 00:26:37.156
I just came to understand him.

410
00:26:37.156 --> 00:26:39.225
I was always next to him.

411
00:26:40.325 --> 00:26:43.436
He didn't go back because he wanted to.

412
00:26:43.765 --> 00:26:45.535
He just opened his own factory.

413
00:26:46.436 --> 00:26:48.065
It must be really tough for him.

414
00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:53.075
Then what do you think about this?

415
00:26:53.805 --> 00:26:55.946
He's become the president now.

416
00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:58.146
While he's in that position,

417
00:26:58.146 --> 00:26:59.485
he can get permission to marry you.

418
00:26:59.715 --> 00:27:03.315
Father just has to persuade Mother, right?

419
00:27:04.616 --> 00:27:06.285
Why do I need permission?

420
00:27:06.285 --> 00:27:07.825
I am going to Finland.

421
00:27:08.086 --> 00:27:09.186
Once you get permission,

422
00:27:09.186 --> 00:27:11.696
you don't have to go take that program.

423
00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:14.725
What? Hey.

424
00:27:16.636 --> 00:27:17.836
Why wouldn't I go?

425
00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:19.565
I earned it with my talent.

426
00:27:19.866 --> 00:27:23.475
Will you still go even if you get permission?

427
00:27:25.606 --> 00:27:27.106
Why did you come back?

428
00:27:27.475 --> 00:27:30.146
Did you come back because of Hyuk or the bakery?

429
00:27:30.676 --> 00:27:33.916
Me? Both.

430
00:27:34.515 --> 00:27:35.646
If you had to choose...

431
00:27:35.646 --> 00:27:38.586
between Hyuk and Mr. Kang's bread,

432
00:27:38.586 --> 00:27:39.686
what would you choose?

433
00:27:40.186 --> 00:27:41.255
What?

434
00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:45.696
That is a very tricky question.

435
00:27:46.525 --> 00:27:49.565
I can't choose one.

436
00:27:49.565 --> 00:27:51.636
I want to learn Mr. Kang's secret recipe...

437
00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:53.336
and bake bread.

438
00:27:54.636 --> 00:27:57.075
- Then is it bread? - No.

439
00:27:59.575 --> 00:28:02.505
I am sorry. This is really difficult.

440
00:28:03.075 --> 00:28:05.646
I have both.

441
00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:11.055
I really liked him too.

442
00:28:11.916 --> 00:28:13.055
But...

443
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.495
I don't think I should give up everything...

444
00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:18.426
for love.

445
00:28:18.725 --> 00:28:21.065
But what you want to do isn't specific...

446
00:28:21.065 --> 00:28:22.896
like my wish to make bread.

447
00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:24.636
I've decided what I want to do too.

448
00:28:25.265 --> 00:28:27.005
Have you decided? What is it?

449
00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:28.465
Wood.

450
00:28:29.505 --> 00:28:31.636
I want to make small things with wood.

451
00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.706
Well, it could be small furniture.

452
00:28:33.706 --> 00:28:36.575
Wooden tableware, dolls, and accessories too.

453
00:28:36.575 --> 00:28:40.245
I want to make small things used every day...

454
00:28:40.245 --> 00:28:41.545
in a small woodworking studio.

455
00:28:41.715 --> 00:28:44.916
About 16m² would do.

456
00:28:46.386 --> 00:28:47.525
(New rumors updated)

457
00:28:49.086 --> 00:28:50.156
(Rumors about H Group)

458
00:28:50.725 --> 00:28:52.656
25 years ago, the family of H Group...

459
00:28:52.656 --> 00:28:55.025
lost their daughter and openly looked for her.

460
00:28:55.025 --> 00:28:56.765
They recently found their daughter.

461
00:28:56.765 --> 00:28:58.936
She was raised in Seoul...

462
00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:00.366
as a daughter of Mr. Seo?

463
00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.606
They must be thrilled to have found her,

464
00:29:03.606 --> 00:29:04.975
but they are covering it up...

465
00:29:04.975 --> 00:29:07.876
perhaps because H Group is already...

466
00:29:08.206 --> 00:29:10.846
the talk of the town because of the successor?

467
00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:21.656
Seok Doo,

468
00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:24.225
did you find the machines and a designer?

469
00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.995
You are so impatient, aren't you?

470
00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:29.666
I just came back a few days ago.

471
00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:31.166
That's good.

472
00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:33.866
The other day, you said you wanted to...

473
00:29:33.866 --> 00:29:35.366
work with me if my health allowed it.

474
00:29:35.636 --> 00:29:38.136
Let me work with you. I'll do it.

475
00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:40.106
- You want to work? - Yes.

476
00:29:40.406 --> 00:29:42.376
Are you denying...

477
00:29:42.376 --> 00:29:44.475
what you said earlier?

478
00:29:44.975 --> 00:29:47.116
I am the one who got you...

479
00:29:47.116 --> 00:29:49.015
that motorcycle business.

480
00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.025
Give us a medium-sized steamed seafood, please.

481
00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:55.086
Yes, sir.

482
00:29:55.225 --> 00:29:56.225
Hey,

483
00:29:56.525 --> 00:29:58.926
steamed seafood is too spicy for you.

484
00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:01.265
Stop the show now.

485
00:30:02.025 --> 00:30:03.535
You knew it too, didn't you?

486
00:30:06.735 --> 00:30:08.366
Did you find out only now?

487
00:30:09.636 --> 00:30:11.305
Right. I know now.

488
00:30:12.206 --> 00:30:15.106
I wanted to get diagnosed with cancer....

489
00:30:15.475 --> 00:30:16.846
so that I could afford...

490
00:30:16.846 --> 00:30:19.416
Ji An to stay abroad even after the program.

491
00:30:20.815 --> 00:30:22.015
But it turns out I don't have cancer.

492
00:30:24.315 --> 00:30:25.715
You don't have cancer.

493
00:30:26.985 --> 00:30:28.285
It breaks my heart.

494
00:30:30.325 --> 00:30:32.196
But why can't I stop laughing?

495
00:30:33.725 --> 00:30:35.126
You idiot.

496
00:30:35.396 --> 00:30:38.235
I realized I can't even die when I need to.

497
00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:41.366
Do you want to give even your only life...

498
00:30:41.366 --> 00:30:43.535
to your children?

499
00:30:45.035 --> 00:30:46.805
If I was competent,

500
00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:48.305
Ji An wouldn't have have gone through...

501
00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:49.406
all those tough things.

502
00:30:49.406 --> 00:30:51.975
Then she met someone.

503
00:30:52.616 --> 00:30:55.545
They really love each other.

504
00:30:56.686 --> 00:30:58.856
But they can never be together.

505
00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.956
You have to physically be away to grow apart.

506
00:31:04.525 --> 00:31:06.866
I wanted to help her do that.

507
00:31:08.065 --> 00:31:11.696
No, I have to help her no matter what I do.

508
00:31:12.235 --> 00:31:14.706
I should at least pay for her living expenses.

509
00:31:16.305 --> 00:31:18.735
She managed to get them pay the tuition...

510
00:31:18.735 --> 00:31:20.346
and the language school fee.

511
00:31:20.346 --> 00:31:22.376
I should at least pay for the living expenses.

512
00:31:22.606 --> 00:31:24.676
Are you going to live for your children again?

513
00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:26.315
You nearly died.

514
00:31:26.315 --> 00:31:27.416
Stop it.

515
00:31:31.715 --> 00:31:32.856
Did you just smile?

516
00:31:33.755 --> 00:31:34.856
Seok Doo.

517
00:31:35.386 --> 00:31:36.856
You don't know this, do you?

518
00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:41.495
My children treated me the best they could...

519
00:31:41.495 --> 00:31:43.096
even if I wasn't dying.

520
00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:45.995
They didn't treat me well because I was dying.

521
00:31:45.995 --> 00:31:49.706
They knew I wasn't dying, but they really tried.

522
00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:53.305
I couldn't be more thankful for that.

523
00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:57.946
I was still their father.

524
00:32:00.386 --> 00:32:02.086
Have you ever experienced such love?

525
00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:36.285
His doctor is checking his condition now.

526
00:32:37.785 --> 00:32:38.815
Thank you.

527
00:32:46.295 --> 00:32:47.696
(Gi Jae)

528
00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:49.396
I don't know if you read this or not,

529
00:32:49.396 --> 00:32:50.936
but I'm sending it to you as it looks serious.

530
00:32:52.035 --> 00:32:55.305
(Rumors about H Group)

531
00:32:58.035 --> 00:32:59.575
(They're probably hushing it up because...)

532
00:32:59.575 --> 00:33:01.106
(their successor A is still missing.)

533
00:33:12.755 --> 00:33:16.055
It's too serious to be regarded as a rumor.

534
00:33:17.055 --> 00:33:19.765
Mr. Seo's daughter, Ms. Seo?

535
00:33:20.995 --> 00:33:22.936
It's from someone who knows something.

536
00:33:27.465 --> 00:33:28.465
Where's Dad?

537
00:33:29.235 --> 00:33:31.275
Chairman No isn't here yet.

538
00:33:31.836 --> 00:33:32.876
Really?

539
00:33:33.376 --> 00:33:36.315
Myung Hee, I heard a rumor on the way here.

540
00:33:36.315 --> 00:33:37.815
Jin Hee. It's you, isn't it?

541
00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:40.485
I'm sick of hearing that.

542
00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.146
You always say that.

543
00:33:42.956 --> 00:33:44.755
You introduced a wrong girl...

544
00:33:44.755 --> 00:33:47.126
to four people at the gallery.

545
00:33:47.126 --> 00:33:49.696
And there are Ms. Min and the housekeepers.

546
00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:53.096
Grandfather is here.

547
00:33:54.965 --> 00:33:56.196
Stay quiet.

548
00:33:56.196 --> 00:33:58.565
Father is not ready to hear bad news.

549
00:33:59.465 --> 00:34:02.265
Is it worse than the fact your husband's not here?

550
00:34:10.675 --> 00:34:12.515
Fortunately, there's no brain damage.

551
00:34:12.776 --> 00:34:14.586
And the stent surgery was a success.

552
00:34:14.816 --> 00:34:16.256
He will recover soon.

553
00:34:17.615 --> 00:34:18.716
Doctor Yoon.

554
00:34:19.385 --> 00:34:20.655
Thank you.

555
00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:29.666
Father.

556
00:34:30.436 --> 00:34:31.865
I'm so relieved now.

557
00:34:33.166 --> 00:34:35.905
I'm glad to see you all again.

558
00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:40.075
I'm alive.

559
00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:44.216
Myung Soo will be here soon.

560
00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:47.546
And Jae Sung will be here soon too.

561
00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:54.586
Do Kyung, are you going to work tomorrow?

562
00:34:55.285 --> 00:34:57.896
I started going to work today.

563
00:35:00.365 --> 00:35:03.066
So I came back from the dead for a reason.

564
00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:11.936
Where's Myung Soo?

565
00:35:12.876 --> 00:35:15.975
He's the only person who can take care of the work.

566
00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:19.276
Jae Sung is still out of contact.

567
00:35:19.745 --> 00:35:21.916
Why would Myung Soo take care of the company?

568
00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:23.486
We have Do Kyung here.

569
00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:26.825
Do Kyung will take care of all the work.

570
00:35:27.356 --> 00:35:32.296
Just tell Myung Soo to get ready to go to Europe.

571
00:35:34.195 --> 00:35:37.566
Father, don't worry about the company.

572
00:35:37.666 --> 00:35:39.135
You should get some rest.

573
00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:41.365
Okay.

574
00:35:55.389 --> 00:36:00.389
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E46 My Golden Life "Why Did You Come Back?"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

575
00:36:15.635 --> 00:36:17.106
There are some people...

576
00:36:17.635 --> 00:36:20.245
who know that we found Ji Soo.

577
00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:22.776
But it even has...

578
00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:25.475
her family name Seo in the rumors.

579
00:36:26.816 --> 00:36:29.146
It means someone intended to leak the information.

580
00:36:30.115 --> 00:36:33.126
But it's too early to say that it's from Jin Hee.

581
00:36:33.126 --> 00:36:35.785
It's something that upsets your grandfather the most.

582
00:36:37.256 --> 00:36:40.966
It might be from Seo Tae Soo's family.

583
00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:43.566
Sunwoo Hyuk and even his sister know...

584
00:36:44.265 --> 00:36:46.466
that Ji Soo is my daughter.

585
00:36:46.466 --> 00:36:49.805
They are the last people to leak the information.

586
00:36:51.336 --> 00:36:53.845
This is why I tried to send Ji Soo abroad.

587
00:36:53.845 --> 00:36:55.745
She should've gone abroad to study.

588
00:36:55.845 --> 00:36:56.845
Mother.

589
00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:01.515
This might not end up as a groundless rumor.

590
00:37:03.256 --> 00:37:05.716
What about Uncle Jung?

591
00:37:07.756 --> 00:37:09.626
He must've been shocked by the personnel appointment.

592
00:37:10.555 --> 00:37:12.225
He must've felt betrayed.

593
00:37:14.166 --> 00:37:15.925
He'd be promoted to Vice President...

594
00:37:15.925 --> 00:37:18.336
after taking care of the resort in Europe.

595
00:37:19.035 --> 00:37:20.106
Really?

596
00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:24.376
But I'll have to check why the rumor is going around.

597
00:37:26.376 --> 00:37:27.405
Yes.

598
00:37:28.506 --> 00:37:32.115
Then let's get together and talk about it. Sure.

599
00:37:36.046 --> 00:37:37.655
I guess I came here too soon.

600
00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:39.555
I was too late.

601
00:37:40.055 --> 00:37:43.026
I thought you'd stay with Chairman No for a while.

602
00:37:43.626 --> 00:37:46.995
I called a meeting with of all brand managers.

603
00:37:47.995 --> 00:37:51.436
And I'll use the office of Vice President for now.

604
00:37:51.635 --> 00:37:52.666
Why?

605
00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:54.666
I should've given it more thought.

606
00:37:55.466 --> 00:37:57.905
You can use this office before you go to Europe.

607
00:37:59.376 --> 00:38:00.546
No. It's okay.

608
00:38:05.046 --> 00:38:06.416
I'm ready to leave.

609
00:38:06.945 --> 00:38:08.986
Are you going to the hospital now?

610
00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:10.816
Yes. I should go visit Chairman No.

611
00:38:11.385 --> 00:38:14.225
Before you leave, please take a look at this.

612
00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.555
There's a rumor about our family.

613
00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:18.825
And I don't know how to handle it.

614
00:38:18.825 --> 00:38:20.095
A rumor?

615
00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:26.095
(Rumors about H Group)

616
00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:28.466
"She was raised as Mr. Seo's daughter."

617
00:38:30.336 --> 00:38:32.305
I think you should go ask Mr. Seo.

618
00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:38.575
They wouldn't have started the rumor.

619
00:38:40.046 --> 00:38:41.586
You know that, Do Kyung.

620
00:38:42.146 --> 00:38:43.885
You can't put things back once a rumor is spread.

621
00:38:44.515 --> 00:38:46.325
Why would you even care about it?

622
00:38:48.425 --> 00:38:49.655
I'll see you later.

623
00:38:55.425 --> 00:38:56.736
I'm here.

624
00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.466
What are you doing here?

625
00:38:59.836 --> 00:39:02.066
I brought these cat toys for the package.

626
00:39:02.066 --> 00:39:03.675
I told you I'd get you some more.

627
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:04.836
I see.

628
00:39:05.305 --> 00:39:06.845
You came early.

629
00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:09.206
I heard you got more pre-orders.

630
00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.745
How would you handle the orders alone...

631
00:39:11.745 --> 00:39:13.345
until Do Kyung comes back?

632
00:39:13.686 --> 00:39:16.515
Vice President... I mean President Choi...

633
00:39:16.785 --> 00:39:18.216
is not coming back.

634
00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:20.325
What?

635
00:39:20.385 --> 00:39:21.956
He can't run the factory now.

636
00:39:21.956 --> 00:39:23.655
So he will hand it over to me.

637
00:39:24.655 --> 00:39:26.695
You're not taking over temporarily,

638
00:39:27.526 --> 00:39:29.095
but he's handing over the factory to you?

639
00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:31.635
He says he has to go back to the company.

640
00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.666
Chairman No collapsed.

641
00:39:34.135 --> 00:39:35.506
I know that.

642
00:39:36.436 --> 00:39:38.405
But I heard he regained his consciousness...

643
00:39:38.405 --> 00:39:40.876
and is not in a critical condition now.

644
00:39:41.106 --> 00:39:42.706
I don't know much about that.

645
00:39:43.015 --> 00:39:44.975
But he called me...

646
00:39:44.975 --> 00:39:47.316
and said he can't do this and I should run it.

647
00:39:47.316 --> 00:39:48.816
That's all I heard.

648
00:39:49.285 --> 00:39:51.716
And he told me to pick up the car tomorrow.

649
00:39:59.356 --> 00:40:01.225
If I return now,

650
00:40:01.225 --> 00:40:04.296
I must live like a spare part of Haesung forever.

651
00:40:06.936 --> 00:40:08.836
That's not the life I want.

652
00:40:09.805 --> 00:40:11.805
That's why I must be independent.

653
00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:15.445
I won't go home until I'm independent.

654
00:40:17.146 --> 00:40:19.885
Seo Ji An. It's not about you anymore.

655
00:40:22.646 --> 00:40:23.916
He said that.

656
00:40:26.256 --> 00:40:27.956
But it ends up like this.

657
00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:42.566
Do Kyung, are you back now?

658
00:40:43.606 --> 00:40:46.206
It's been long. How have you been?

659
00:40:47.046 --> 00:40:49.146
You should've come before Grandfather collapsed.

660
00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.615
This isn't good.

661
00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.325
I'm home, Mother.

662
00:41:02.856 --> 00:41:04.626
Go to your room, and get some rest.

663
00:41:04.626 --> 00:41:06.325
I'll see you at the company tomorrow.

664
00:41:07.725 --> 00:41:09.666
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

665
00:41:21.776 --> 00:41:24.046
What's all this?

666
00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.716
Your appetite changes when you're pregnant.

667
00:41:26.716 --> 00:41:28.445
I don't know what she likes,

668
00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:29.916
so I cooked many different dishes.

669
00:41:29.916 --> 00:41:32.356
Mother, you don't have to do this for me.

670
00:41:32.716 --> 00:41:34.356
All I need is this soup.

671
00:41:40.095 --> 00:41:41.265
You don't like it?

672
00:41:42.796 --> 00:41:45.695
Yes. I used to like dried pollack soup.

673
00:41:46.566 --> 00:41:48.035
That's amazing.

674
00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:49.675
Is it true that her appetite changed?

675
00:41:50.175 --> 00:41:52.376
This isn't the only thing that is amazing.

676
00:41:52.606 --> 00:41:54.245
You'll be feeling...

677
00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:56.615
emotions that you've never experienced in your life.

678
00:41:57.445 --> 00:42:00.416
Soo A, tell me if there's anything you want to eat.

679
00:42:00.515 --> 00:42:02.586
And you shouldn't do anything around the house.

680
00:42:02.856 --> 00:42:04.916
Ji Tae'll clean the rooms on the second floor.

681
00:42:04.916 --> 00:42:06.225
And he'll do the laundry too.

682
00:42:06.285 --> 00:42:09.225
I'll clean the rooms, but I should do the laundry?

683
00:42:10.555 --> 00:42:12.756
After I gave birth to four children,

684
00:42:12.756 --> 00:42:14.296
your dad did the laundry...

685
00:42:14.296 --> 00:42:15.425
until you guys became a year old.

686
00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.436
Did Father do the laundry?

687
00:42:18.995 --> 00:42:22.135
He said that if a mother feels tired,

688
00:42:22.405 --> 00:42:24.535
the baby in her body can feel that.

689
00:42:27.146 --> 00:42:29.075
How did I forget all about that?

690
00:42:39.586 --> 00:42:41.126
Why are you cleaning?

691
00:42:41.126 --> 00:42:42.655
That's my job.

692
00:42:46.896 --> 00:42:49.396
I clean when I need a distraction.

693
00:42:56.475 --> 00:42:57.905
What are you doing?

694
00:42:58.475 --> 00:42:59.706
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:00.675 --> 00:43:02.146
I complained,

696
00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:04.276
distinguished your family from mine,

697
00:43:04.475 --> 00:43:06.716
and yelled at you. I'm sorry for it all.

698
00:43:07.745 --> 00:43:09.686
Put your hands down, and get off the bed.

699
00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:12.015
Life isn't worth living...

700
00:43:12.015 --> 00:43:13.956
when you don't laugh.

701
00:43:18.626 --> 00:43:20.026
I'm sorry too.

702
00:43:20.296 --> 00:43:22.526
I asked if you put Ji Soo before me.

703
00:43:23.736 --> 00:43:24.765
I was childish.

704
00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:26.436
Really?

705
00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:31.276
You were.

706
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:33.445
But you were cute too.

707
00:43:33.475 --> 00:43:34.575
Come here.

708
00:43:44.586 --> 00:43:45.816
Hee.

709
00:43:49.356 --> 00:43:51.695
- Take care. - Hee.

710
00:43:53.095 --> 00:43:55.566
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

711
00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:04.135
It'll sound like a lie if I say no.

712
00:44:05.475 --> 00:44:08.506
What you worry about won't happen.

713
00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:14.046
What if...

714
00:44:14.646 --> 00:44:16.456
your identity...

715
00:44:16.885 --> 00:44:19.956
causes us and Hyuk another problem?

716
00:44:20.756 --> 00:44:23.595
Will you break up with Hyuk then?

717
00:44:25.456 --> 00:44:28.626
If something else happens, I couldn't face him.

718
00:44:33.666 --> 00:44:34.736
Okay.

719
00:44:44.845 --> 00:44:47.186
I want to withdraw everything in here.

720
00:44:51.216 --> 00:44:53.725
All 37,500 dollars?

721
00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:56.495
Hurry up. I want it in 50-dollar bills.

722
00:44:57.856 --> 00:45:00.765
Then you need to fill this in.

723
00:45:00.765 --> 00:45:02.325
I don't care about that.

724
00:45:02.695 --> 00:45:04.466
Just give me the money.

725
00:45:09.836 --> 00:45:10.975
My goodness.

726
00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:16.816
Where are you sending it? Will you wire it?

727
00:45:16.816 --> 00:45:19.986
No. It has to be cash.

728
00:45:20.146 --> 00:45:21.345
Not even checks.

729
00:45:22.285 --> 00:45:25.256
Sir, were you on the phone with a cop...

730
00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:26.385
or a prosecutor?

731
00:45:33.725 --> 00:45:37.236
Sir, you have to watch out for voice phishers...

732
00:45:37.236 --> 00:45:38.535
impersonating cops or prosecutors.

733
00:45:39.535 --> 00:45:40.706
Thank you.

734
00:45:41.436 --> 00:45:43.876
I almost lost the money I was saving up...

735
00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:45.776
to open my son's clinic.

736
00:45:46.706 --> 00:45:48.675
My son's in medical school...

737
00:45:48.675 --> 00:45:50.675
and he graduated as the top of his class.

738
00:45:51.376 --> 00:45:52.515
You must be proud.

739
00:45:52.776 --> 00:45:55.046
- Thank you. - Sure.

740
00:45:56.285 --> 00:45:57.356
Goodbye.

741
00:45:58.986 --> 00:46:02.385
Remember the rumor about Haesung's daughter?

742
00:46:03.626 --> 00:46:05.995
The news said they found her.

743

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:33.725
Yes, my laptop's on. Why?

751
00:46:33.725 --> 00:46:35.186

(News, Haesung's Choi Eun Seok)

755
00:46:43.135 --> 00:46:45.995
It's about our dad and Ji Soo.

756
00:46:46.506 --> 00:46:48.405

(On August 19, 1992, the country...)

759
00:47:02.646 --> 00:47:05.385
I'm your new president, Choi Do Kyung.

760
00:47:08.856 --> 00:47:10.195
It's my first day,

761
00:47:10.695 --> 00:47:13.466
but I asked to meet the chief directors...

762
00:47:13.466 --> 00:47:15.225
and senior managers from Haesung Apparel's...

763

seven brands from women's wear to jewelry.

764
00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:22.135
I wanted to greet you all in person...

765
00:47:22.135 --> 00:47:24.936
and brief you on the direction we'll take.

766
00:47:28.475 --> 00:47:29.745
Ms. Lee.

767
00:47:30.475 --> 00:47:31.615
Mr. Choi.

768
00:47:32.575 --> 00:47:33.916
Is there a problem?

769
00:47:36.956 --> 00:47:38.356
President Choi...

770
00:48:02.405 --> 00:48:03.416
Hi.

771
00:48:04.146 --> 00:48:05.376
Did you see the news?

772
00:48:06.146 --> 00:48:07.646
Yes, just now.

773
00:48:07.945 --> 00:48:09.245
What happened?

774
00:48:09.916 --> 00:48:11.086
I'll find out now.

775
00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:14.655
It shows that it's based on rumors,

776
00:48:14.655 --> 00:48:16.495
but it's arousing curiosity.

777
00:48:16.495 --> 00:48:18.155
They even used my dad's surname.

778
00:48:19.195 --> 00:48:20.566
I'll find out and call you.

779
00:48:21.166 --> 00:48:22.225
Don't worry too much.

780
00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.666
What about Ji Soo?

781
00:48:24.236 --> 00:48:27.006
What if a reporter goes to the bakery?

782
00:48:27.365 --> 00:48:29.706
Take Ji Soo to the share house.

783
00:48:30.236 --> 00:48:31.336
Okay.

784
00:48:37.416 --> 00:48:39.175
The reporters keep calling.

785
00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:45.586
Call the legal team and deny everything.

786
00:48:45.586 --> 00:48:46.885
Don't answer the phones either.

787
00:48:46.956 --> 00:48:47.956
Yes, ma'am.

788
00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:54.495
Mom, did you read the news?

789
00:48:55.066 --> 00:48:56.535
Yes, Do Kyung.

790
00:48:56.936 --> 00:48:59.836
I asked the reporter where he heard it from.

791
00:49:00.506 --> 00:49:02.566
He said he has to protect his sources.

792
00:49:03.506 --> 00:49:06.606
It started with rumors and became news.

793
00:49:06.845 --> 00:49:07.876
I think...

794
00:49:08.905 --> 00:49:11.146
we must announce we found Eun Seok.

795
00:49:12.515 --> 00:49:15.515
We can't yet. Let's talk with your grandpa first.

796
00:49:17.015 --> 00:49:18.015
But...

797
00:49:18.885 --> 00:49:22.256
how did you know Ji Soo lived with Seo Tae Soo?

798
00:49:25.325 --> 00:49:26.396
What?

799
00:49:26.526 --> 00:49:29.566
You never told me...

800
00:49:29.796 --> 00:49:31.095
how you found Ji Soo.

801
00:49:33.506 --> 00:49:36.236
Let's talk after I see your grandpa.

802
00:49:40.506 --> 00:49:42.276
Do Kyung wants us to come clean,

803
00:49:42.276 --> 00:49:44.216
but I'm not sure what to do.

804
00:49:44.845 --> 00:49:46.586
Come clean that we found her?

805
00:49:48.845 --> 00:49:51.316
What do you think will happen next?

806
00:49:52.486 --> 00:49:54.285
They'll find Seo Tae Soo.

807
00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:58.055
He'll say he found Eun Seok in Jeongseon.

808
00:49:58.296 --> 00:50:00.896
The problem is that people will wonder...

809
00:50:00.896 --> 00:50:02.896
how I knew he had Ji Soo.

810
00:50:03.095 --> 00:50:05.166
Then we must mention Jo Soon Ok,

811
00:50:05.166 --> 00:50:06.666
and they'll find out about...

812
00:50:06.666 --> 00:50:09.436
the accident happened near Yangpyeong Resting Area.

813
00:50:12.575 --> 00:50:15.445
I should've told the truth then.

814
00:50:16.575 --> 00:50:19.216
You were in a coma for two weeks.

815
00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:22.416
The whole country was focused on you.

816
00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:25.615
Then what? The reporters are calling.

817
00:50:25.615 --> 00:50:30.055
Tell Ms. Min to find out which site reported first.

818
00:50:30.055 --> 00:50:33.066
Make them take it down and issue an apology.

819
00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.396
It's nothing.

820
00:50:35.896 --> 00:50:39.265
Do you think Jin Hee did it?

821
00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:41.966
What would they gain from this?

822
00:50:42.436 --> 00:50:44.075
It's an insult to our family.

823
00:50:45.336 --> 00:50:46.876
Would I let them be?

824
00:50:48.106 --> 00:50:49.675
But it's only a temporary measure.

825
00:50:50.115 --> 00:50:52.945
We can't hide that we found Eun Seok forever.

826
00:50:55.885 --> 00:50:57.956
- Ji Soo, let's go. - What for?

827
00:50:57.956 --> 00:50:58.986
I'm working.

828
00:50:58.986 --> 00:51:00.626
We have to make our afternoon batch.

829
00:51:00.626 --> 00:51:03.296
Sorry, Nam Goo. I'll explain later.

830
00:51:03.495 --> 00:51:04.725
- Let's go. - But...

831
00:51:05.995 --> 00:51:07.095
Ji Soo.

832
00:51:07.666 --> 00:51:09.296
What's this article?

833
00:51:09.865 --> 00:51:11.195
What... What article?

834
00:51:11.695 --> 00:51:13.206
What article?

835
00:51:17.436 --> 00:51:20.345
Who on earth talked to the reporter?

836
00:51:20.876 --> 00:51:22.405
What'll happen to me?

837
00:51:23.515 --> 00:51:26.075
Do Kyung said he'd find out and call back.

838
00:51:26.515 --> 00:51:29.245
You should stay here until he calls.

839
00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:30.655
Should we...

840
00:51:30.655 --> 00:51:32.885
get so upset when they didn't mention...

841
00:51:32.885 --> 00:51:34.325
Ji Soo's name or address?

842
00:51:35.086 --> 00:51:36.456
We can't be sure.

843
00:51:36.555 --> 00:51:38.526
They might know and just...

844
00:51:38.856 --> 00:51:40.995
want to get evidence or photos.

845
00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:44.296
Then our dad's in danger too.

846
00:51:44.535 --> 00:51:46.265
I'll call him soon.

847
00:51:46.265 --> 00:51:47.666
I think he should know.

848
00:51:48.836 --> 00:51:50.075
Will it do?

849
00:51:50.075 --> 00:51:52.276
I think we can do something with it.

850
00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:53.805
(Machinery)

851
00:51:53.805 --> 00:51:54.876
Sorry.

852
00:51:55.175 --> 00:51:57.146
(Ji An)

853
00:52:00.316 --> 00:52:01.816
Hi, Ji An.

854
00:52:02.445 --> 00:52:04.655
Dad, did you read the news?

855
00:52:05.186 --> 00:52:07.325
"The news"? About what?

856
00:52:07.956 --> 00:52:09.626
Where are you right now?

857
00:52:11.126 --> 00:52:12.626
Thank you so much.

858
00:52:13.666 --> 00:52:15.896
I'll pay you a visit soon.

859
00:52:16.396 --> 00:52:17.436
Bye.

860
00:52:20.405 --> 00:52:21.566
Will they take it down?

861
00:52:22.206 --> 00:52:23.736
I said it's no big deal.

862
00:52:24.006 --> 00:52:26.546
We earned some time. Let's rest...

863
00:52:26.546 --> 00:52:28.245
before taking countermeasures.

864
00:52:34.086 --> 00:52:36.515
Chairman No. Ma'am.

865
00:52:37.486 --> 00:52:39.316
It's down already?

866
00:52:39.316 --> 00:52:40.425
Yes.

867
00:52:40.425 --> 00:52:43.796
But a follow-up article surfaced.

868
00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:46.725
"A follow-up article"?

869
00:52:47.695 --> 00:52:48.796
Read it.

870
00:52:50.796 --> 00:52:52.736
You should read it yourselves.

871
00:52:54.436 --> 00:52:56.006
What does it say?

872
00:52:57.035 --> 00:53:00.745
A reporter who looked into the disappearance...

873
00:53:00.745 --> 00:53:03.776
25 years ago wrote about his suspicions online.

874
00:53:03.776 --> 00:53:06.515
Another reporter found it and wrote about it.

875
00:53:06.515 --> 00:53:08.716
The disappearance 25 years ago?

876
00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:10.655
Read it.

877
00:53:13.425 --> 00:53:15.856
"A post written by a Mr. Han,"

878
00:53:15.856 --> 00:53:18.595
"a reporter at a daily newspaper..."

879
00:53:18.956 --> 00:53:21.265
"when Choi Eun Seok disappeared..."

880
00:53:21.265 --> 00:53:23.466
"25 years ago, is gathering interest."

881
00:53:24.066 --> 00:53:25.995
"He insisted that the truth..."

882
00:53:26.206 --> 00:53:29.265
"was faked and covered up by the Haesung family."

883
00:53:29.635 --> 00:53:31.276
"Repercussions are expected."

884
00:53:34.146 --> 00:53:37.245
First, it mentions that where Eun Seok was lost...

885
00:53:37.445 --> 00:53:39.845
wasn't where the accident happened.

886
00:53:41.146 --> 00:53:42.216
Second,

887
00:53:43.256 --> 00:53:44.615
the cause of the accident...

888
00:53:44.615 --> 00:53:47.086
was Ms. No's speeding and illegal u-turn.

889
00:53:47.086 --> 00:53:48.356
The article says...

890
00:53:50.725 --> 00:53:52.796
it was because Ms. No was on her way...

891
00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:55.195
to the Yangpyeong villa to meet a man.

892
00:53:55.825 --> 00:53:56.896
As evidence,

893
00:53:57.265 --> 00:54:00.106
there's a recording of Ms. No's nanny's voice.

894
00:54:02.635 --> 00:54:03.706
Stop.

895
00:54:04.876 --> 00:54:06.075
Dad.

896
00:54:07.706 --> 00:54:08.845
Go on.

897
00:54:10.175 --> 00:54:12.986
Finally, it says you manipulated the media.

898
00:54:13.945 --> 00:54:15.546
This was a scoop,

899
00:54:15.546 --> 00:54:18.216
but the editor stopped it from going to press.

900
00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:21.925
Afterwards, every media outlet reported...

901
00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.595
what the police said.

902
00:54:24.026 --> 00:54:25.695
That someone kidnapped Eun Seok...

903
00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:28.166
at the scene of the accident...

904
00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:30.836
for the diamonds in her hairpin.

905
00:54:30.995 --> 00:54:32.566
That's how it was covered up.

906
00:54:45.916 --> 00:54:47.945
Ms. No's phone was found in her car,

907
00:54:47.945 --> 00:54:49.445
and the police...

908
00:54:50.115 --> 00:54:51.655
found the last call on her records...

909
00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.385
was to artist J...

910
00:54:53.385 --> 00:54:54.725
but didn't investigate him.

911
00:54:55.586 --> 00:54:57.925
J left Korea shortly after the accident.

912
00:55:03.035 --> 00:55:04.265
No way.

913
00:55:09.706 --> 00:55:11.506
- Mom. - It's a lie.

914
00:55:11.836 --> 00:55:13.845
Wait while we deal with it.

915
00:55:15.475 --> 00:55:16.575
Mom.

916
00:55:22.015 --> 00:55:23.155
(Dad)

917
00:55:26.115 --> 00:55:29.655
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

918
00:55:35.425 --> 00:55:37.666
What... What's this?

919
00:55:39.466 --> 00:55:42.836
She lost me while going to have an affair?

920
00:55:43.675 --> 00:55:45.006
It hasn't been confirmed.

921
00:55:45.106 --> 00:55:47.706
We don't know if it was really by that reporter.

922
00:55:51.146 --> 00:55:52.345
Just a moment.

923
00:56:02.626 --> 00:56:04.296
(Haesung's Missing Daughter, Choi Eun Seok)

924
00:56:04.296 --> 00:56:05.995
(On August 19, 1992, the country...)

925
00:56:07.396 --> 00:56:08.626
(Choi Eun Seok's Disappearance)

926
00:56:08.626 --> 00:56:10.566
(25 years ago, the society was shocked...)

927
00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:31.456
(Ms. Min, Ji Soo, Do Kyung, Myung Hee)

928
00:56:33.986 --> 00:56:36.155
(Ji Soo, Myung Hee, Do Kyung)

929
00:56:38.896 --> 00:56:40.595
Sir, bad news.

930
00:56:40.595 --> 00:56:41.966
The chairman collapsed.

931
00:56:41.966 --> 00:56:43.736
What are you doing?

932
00:56:43.936 --> 00:56:45.436
Call when you get this.

933
00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:47.436
Dad, I have bad news.

934
00:56:47.466 --> 00:56:49.675
Call me. It looks bad.

935
00:56:49.675 --> 00:56:52.175
Dad, where are you?

936
00:57:00.015 --> 00:57:01.515
Did Ji Soo read this?

937
00:57:02.216 --> 00:57:04.155
She must be so scared.

938
00:57:05.015 --> 00:57:07.026
If it's true, that's incredible.

939
00:57:07.285 --> 00:57:08.586
It's not just incredible.

940
00:57:09.055 --> 00:57:11.495
Think about it. They lost their child...

941
00:57:11.495 --> 00:57:14.526
and Ji Soo's father punched Father.

942
00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:18.995
Soo A, that was because of me.

943
00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:22.635
The weird things they did aren't the problem.

944
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:26.345
It'll be no time before they identify all of us.

945
00:57:26.475 --> 00:57:28.206
What's there to worry?

946
00:57:28.276 --> 00:57:30.716
You found Ji Soo in Jeongseon.

947
00:57:30.716 --> 00:57:32.146
You just have to say...

948
00:57:32.146 --> 00:57:34.385
someone came to the house and took the toothbrushes.

949
00:57:36.356 --> 00:57:39.216
But why aren't Dad and Ji An home yet?

950
00:57:51.365 --> 00:57:53.135
What's going on?

951
00:57:53.566 --> 00:57:55.365
The chairman wishes to see you.

952
00:57:55.535 --> 00:57:56.706
The chairman?

953
00:57:58.006 --> 00:58:00.206
I have no reason to see him.

954
00:58:31.206 --> 00:58:32.336
Welcome.

955
00:58:33.876 --> 00:58:35.046
Are you sick?

956
00:58:36.675 --> 00:58:37.945
I'm very poorly.

957
00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:41.445
I'm not able to speak for long.

958
00:58:47.856 --> 00:58:50.225
Why did you ask to see me?

959
00:58:50.756 --> 00:58:52.026
I'll wait outside.

960
00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.135
Did you read the news?

961
00:58:58.466 --> 00:58:59.836
How much did you read?

962
00:59:00.666 --> 00:59:01.905
Everything.

963
00:59:02.666 --> 00:59:04.006
Including the one...

964
00:59:04.376 --> 00:59:07.376
that posed doubts around Ji Soo's disappearance.

965
00:59:11.515 --> 00:59:13.986
Then it'll be a short conversation.

966
00:59:16.385 --> 00:59:18.515
What conversation?

967
00:59:19.456 --> 00:59:21.186
Say you did it.

968
00:59:23.256 --> 00:59:24.256
What?

969
00:59:24.626 --> 00:59:26.925
Say you passed the scene of the accident,

970
00:59:26.925 --> 00:59:29.796
saw the girl, and took her out of greed.

971
00:59:30.995 --> 00:59:33.336
What do you want me to say?

972
00:59:33.865 --> 00:59:35.236
If you do that,

973
00:59:35.236 --> 00:59:37.135
I'll see to it that all your kids...

974
00:59:39.606 --> 00:59:40.706
don't have to...

975
00:59:41.646 --> 00:59:44.515
worry about anything for the rest of their lives.

976
00:59:46.615 --> 00:59:48.845
Are you telling me...

977
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:51.615
to become a kidnapper?

978
00:59:52.015 --> 00:59:54.686
You lost a daughter that was a twin.

979
00:59:55.686 --> 00:59:58.796
You saw a car had crashed and got out to check.

980
00:59:58.925 --> 01:00:01.595
That's when you saw Eun Seok crying alone.

981
01:00:02.526 --> 01:00:05.336
You took her to replace your dead child.

982
01:00:06.265 --> 01:00:07.805
What's the difference?

983
01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.166
There or Jeongseon.

984
01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:10.776
You did take her.

985
01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.206
There's no difference?

986
01:00:14.075 --> 01:00:17.015
No. There's a huge difference.

987
01:00:18.445 --> 01:00:19.586
What's that?

988
01:00:19.986 --> 01:00:22.486
You want me to become some scumbag,

989
01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.885
who ignored a woman seriously hurt...

990
01:00:24.885 --> 01:00:27.256
enough to be in a coma for two weeks.

991
01:00:28.026 --> 01:00:30.725
You want me to be shameless enough...

992
01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:32.296
to sell the pink diamonds.

993
01:00:33.495 --> 01:00:35.966
Instead of taking a child to replace my dead girl,

994
01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.365
you want me to say...

995
01:00:37.365 --> 01:00:39.135
my greed took over and I...

996
01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.936
ignored a dying woman to kidnap for diamonds.

997
01:00:47.305 --> 01:00:50.015
I'm a father of 2 boys and 2 girls.

998
01:00:51.046 --> 01:00:53.445
I won't do anything to insult them.

999
01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:55.885
Whether you insult them...

1000
01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.816
or provide for them is up to you.

1001
01:00:58.216 --> 01:01:00.086
If you don't do as I say,

1002
01:01:00.086 --> 01:01:03.896
I can make your kids grovel in bare feet.

1003
01:01:06.865 --> 01:01:08.296
There's one more.

1004
01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:11.995
You must tell the police you swapped the girls.

1005
01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:16.336
What I'm saying...

1006
01:01:17.376 --> 01:01:20.046
is that you have no choice.

1007
01:01:28.015 --> 01:01:30.515
Don't glare at me. Close your eyes,

1008
01:01:30.515 --> 01:01:33.086
and imagine seeing your kids suffer.

1009
01:01:43.796 --> 01:01:45.796
You wronged us.

1010
01:01:47.836 --> 01:01:49.236
Make up for it.

1011
01:01:56.675 --> 01:01:57.975
Very well.

1012
01:01:59.586 --> 01:02:01.916
I'll do as you say.

1013
01:02:02.816 --> 01:02:05.655
Just don't let my identity get out.

1014
01:02:07.425 --> 01:02:10.225
You have to admit everything to the press.

1015
01:02:10.296 --> 01:02:11.825
I can't do that.

1016
01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:20.006
We're at square one.

1017
01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:23.106
No.

1018
01:02:23.836 --> 01:02:25.736
You need me.

1019
01:02:27.646 --> 01:02:28.675
Because...

1020
01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:31.675
what the reporter exposed is all true.

1021
01:02:31.876 --> 01:02:33.216
Your daughter...

1022
01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:35.186
lost her child at the resting area...

1023
01:02:35.186 --> 01:02:36.686
on her way to have an affair.

1024
01:02:37.015 --> 01:02:39.316
She got into an accident to find her...

1025
01:02:39.316 --> 01:02:40.825
and woke up after two weeks.

1026
01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.825
So you couldn't say...

1027
01:02:43.825 --> 01:02:46.265
she lost the child at the resting area.

1028
01:02:46.265 --> 01:02:47.725
It will be humiliating.

1029
01:02:49.026 --> 01:02:50.635
Hey, Seo Tae Soo.

1030
01:02:50.966 --> 01:02:52.135
The woman who came...

1031
01:02:53.566 --> 01:02:55.606
to pick up the toothbrushes...

1032
01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.336
took Ji Soo.

1033
01:02:58.035 --> 01:03:00.106
Then you found out the girl you lost...

1034
01:03:00.106 --> 01:03:01.546
is at my house.

1035
01:03:01.546 --> 01:03:05.115
But you can’t say who that was because...

1036
01:03:05.745 --> 01:03:07.416
you manipulated the media...

1037
01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:10.115
and covered it up 25 years ago.

1038
01:03:11.115 --> 01:03:13.785
So if the truth is revealed now,

1039
01:03:13.785 --> 01:03:16.086
the morality of Haesung will be questioned.

1040
01:03:16.086 --> 01:03:19.425
Then you will be ashamed.

1041
01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.595
I heard you were once a successful businessman.

1042
01:03:27.035 --> 01:03:28.706
You’re still determined.

1043
01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:30.305
If you...

1044
01:03:31.135 --> 01:03:34.305
keep telling me to turn myself in,

1045
01:03:34.905 --> 01:03:36.745
I’ll reveal the truth too.

1046
01:03:41.546 --> 01:03:43.885
Then go ahead.

1047
01:03:47.325 --> 01:03:49.155
Let’s both reveal it.

1048
01:03:58.236 --> 01:03:59.236
Vice Chairman Choi.

1049
01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.405
I read the article.

1050
01:04:01.606 --> 01:04:02.936
How is Mr. No?

1051
01:04:03.336 --> 01:04:06.035
Mr. No passed the crisis, and he's okay now.

1052
01:04:06.945 --> 01:04:08.506
Then I'll meet him first.

1053
01:04:09.916 --> 01:04:11.615
If you don't do as I say,

1054
01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:13.686
I'll reveal that you switched your daughter...

1055
01:04:13.686 --> 01:04:15.546
and step on your children.

1056
01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:16.756
There will be no compromise.

1057
01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.986
Seo Tae Soo is here.

1058
01:04:22.126 --> 01:04:23.555
Seo Tae Soo?

1059
01:04:25.225 --> 01:04:26.325
Before that,

1060
01:04:26.765 --> 01:04:28.865
you should take a look at this first.

1061
01:04:31.936 --> 01:04:34.236
If you don't step out to cover this,

1062
01:04:34.236 --> 01:04:35.936
we have no other choice.

1063
01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:39.336
Do you want to go through that?

1064
01:04:41.905 --> 01:04:44.515
Just get over with you switching our daughter?

1065
01:04:44.515 --> 01:04:45.776
I can't do that.

1066
01:04:45.776 --> 01:04:47.015
It doesn't end there.

1067
01:04:47.445 --> 01:04:49.785
I'll grind your children with a grindstone.

1068
01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:50.986
Especially Seo Ji An.

1069
01:04:55.986 --> 01:04:57.756
You can cover the suspicion...

1070
01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:01.626
without revealing my face.

1071
01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.135
I'll tell the police...

1072
01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:06.506
as you told me.

1073
01:05:06.506 --> 01:05:08.106
But...

1074
01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.436
you just have to protect my personal information.

1075
01:05:20.986 --> 01:05:22.316
I beg you.

1076
01:05:24.155 --> 01:05:25.316
Stop my children...

1077
01:05:26.385 --> 01:05:29.356
from becoming a criminal's children.

1078
01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:32.925
There will be no compromise.

1079
01:05:34.825 --> 01:05:35.966
Mr. No.

1080
01:05:36.836 --> 01:05:39.966
There's an article about Ji Soo and Ji An switched.

1081
01:05:40.305 --> 01:05:41.365
(Haesung Corporation's daughter was found...)

1082
01:05:41.365 --> 01:05:42.436
(after 25 years, but she was a fake.)

1083
01:06:34.486 --> 01:06:36.995
(My Golden Life)

1084
01:06:37.756 --> 01:06:39.566
Why are there articles about this?

1085
01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:41.026
Who did this?

1086
01:06:41.195 --> 01:06:44.396
I'll cover it as Mr. No said.

1087
01:06:44.396 --> 01:06:45.896
Did he say yes?

1088
01:06:45.896 --> 01:06:47.336
There's an even better solution.

1089
01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.166
You having a press conference.

1090
01:06:49.365 --> 01:06:50.805
They were raised as twins.

1091
01:06:50.805 --> 01:06:52.975
The fake daughter will be so humiliated.

1092
01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:56.575
- Are you scared? - Yes, I am.

1093
01:06:56.575 --> 01:06:58.776
Ji Soo won't be able to live as herself.

1094
01:06:58.776 --> 01:07:00.686
I won't be able to live as Ji An either.

1095
01:07:01.046 --> 01:07:03.856
Aren't you sick of Haesung Corporation people?

1096
01:07:04.155 --> 01:07:05.986
I have an additional suggestion.

1097
01:07:06.686 --> 01:07:08.086
"Dismissal of the CEO"?
