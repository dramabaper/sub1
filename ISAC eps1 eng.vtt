1
00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.370
She's standing without wavering.

2
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.880
Cheng Xiao is the best star whom the championships gave birth to.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.010
After the championships, every show asks her to do rhythmic gymnastics.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.210
That's true.

5
00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.379
She's using a ribbon.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.449
(She starts the game gracefully like the music.)

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.329
She's doing good enough to say that she's an athlete.

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.569
She's expressing herself very well, and it matches well to the music.

9
00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.299
She expresses a mature woman's scent.

10
00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.369
(She's moved.)

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.840
She throws it high.

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.410
- She received it. - She caught it.

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.640
She caught it relaxed.

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.780
(She succeeds in apparatus degree technique.)

15
00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.880
- She caught it. - She got it.

16
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.280
She caught it relaxed.

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.179
There should be no more mistakes.

18
00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.020
(Everyone's watching Cheng Xiao's performance holding breath.)

19
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.859
- She throws it... - She got it.

20
00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.230
- She's relaxed. - She did the technique well.

21
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.700
- She shouldn't get nervous. - That jump was nice.

22
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.730
There she goes.

23
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.840
- It's really amazing. - She connected the balances.

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.870
It was a balance technique that connects three balances.

25
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.769
She missed it.

26
00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:18.810
(Ribbon went up high and she failed in risk degree technique.)

27
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.310
- She missed it. - She missed it.

28
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.219
It's fine. She shouldn't be disturbed.

29
00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.579
- She still has a lot of time left. - She has enough time.

30
00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.349
(She proceeds with the game without being disturbed.)

31
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.290
She must be nervous as the new players are chasing her.

32
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.859
She can just play as she usually does.

33
00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.530
(Cheng Xiao spins four times consecutively.)

34
00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:43.840
How many times did she spin?

35
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.570
It's Fouette Pivot, and she spun four times.

36
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.769
- Really? - Yes.

37
00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:49.340
That was the new movement using the ribbon.

38
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.579
That's right.

39
00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:52.640
The ribbon looks like it's dancing.

40
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.849
The balance degree technique was good.

41
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.349
I can clearly see that Cheng Xiao's performance is stable.

42
00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.689
And her ribbon never stays still.

43
00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:03.189
This is the end.

44
00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.529
(She misses the apparatus at the end.)

45
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.200
Her face says that she regrets her performance especially at the end.

46
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.670
She missed the rhythm a little.

47
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.500
What happened at the end?

48
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.040
As she bent backward,

49
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.640
she missed catching the ribbon with her foot.

50
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.679
But she did well. Cheng Xiao's charm...

51
00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.079
was much expressed.

52
00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.019
The expectations toward Cheng Xiao is so high.

53
00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.390
- She must be feeling so pressured. - She's under so much pressure.

54
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.649
She said so herself.

55
00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.859
She's doing...

56
00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.730
the dance step combination.

57
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.000
She well expressed a passionate woman.

58
00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.269
- She's so flexible. - The balance degree was good.

59
00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.500
She throws the ribbon,

60
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.839
- spins herself... - It was this part.

61
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.510
She caught it but missed after that.

62
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.980
She caught it first,

63
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.140
- but lost her grip afterwards. - That's the worst.

64
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.350
- She must have felt so sorry. - That's why it's important...

65
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.119
to focus to the end in rhythmic gymnastics.

66
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.850
Using her foot around her waist, she drags the ribbon...

67
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.260
and catches the ribbon stick.

68
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.619
That's an apparatus degree technique.

69
00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.829
The audience keeps exclaiming.

70
00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.230
That means...

71
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.660
her performance was on a different level.

72
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.429
You showed a very nice ribbon performance.

73
00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:23.739
How do you feel now?

74
00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.869
To be honest, rather than getting a medal,

75
00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.079
I just tried my best.

76
00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.209
I'd like to appreciate myself for trying hard.

77
00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.579
I'd like to tell other players that they tried hard too.

78
00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.290
I also want to thank the coaches for putting much so effort into us.

79
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.619
It seems that Cheng Xiao learned about life.

80
00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:47.829
- All sports have some life in it. - You're right.

81
00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.329
Now, according to Cheng Xiao's score,

82
00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.869
other players' medal colors can change.

83
00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:55.869
That's right.

84
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.899
In 2018 rhythmic gymnastics in this championships,

85
00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.140
will a new queen be born...

86
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.609
or will the current queen keep her throne?

87
00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.779
- That's right. - Everyone's focused on that.

88
00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.980
What color would Cheng Xiao's medal be?

89
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.119
And what color would the other two players' medals be?

90
00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:14.519
Now, let's see Cheng Xiao's score!

91
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.820
(If she exceeds Rachel's 11.7 points, she keeps her throne.)

92
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.589
She can get the gold medal if she earns more points than Rachel.

93
00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.229
I'm getting nervous.

94
00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.860
- What will it be? - Cheng Xiao!

95
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.200
She received 10.85 points.

96
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.070
She got 3.30 for degree of difficulty, 7.55 for execution.

97
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.940
The total score is 10.85.

98
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.500
She got the bronze medal.

99
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.640
A new queen is born.

100
00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:40.779
Rachel of April takes the gold medal with a score of 11.70,

101
00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.209
Seung Yeon of CLC takes the silver medal,

102
00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:45.120
and the bronze medal goes to Cheng Xiao.

103
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.120
Regardless of who plays better or worse,

104
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.789
what these idol stars did for today's performance...

105
00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:53.219
despite their busy schedules...

106
00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.130
made me feel that they made time no matter what and did their best.

107
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.399
That's why I got goose bumps for every performance.

108
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:03.130
I appreciate that you saw it right.

109
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.839
That's why the team members cry.

110
00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.140
Right. They really practiced hard.

111
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.279
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

112
00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:19.250
(Thank you for your hard work, idol star players.)

113
00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.760
(April goes to thank their fans for their support.)

114
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.959
Thanks to our fans' support,

115
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:32.099
I could have a good result. I'm so happy.

116
00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.599
- Our fans are the best! - Our fans are the best!

117
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.039
(April gives presents to their fans to show their gratitude.)

118
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.839
(Fans and April members enjoy it together.)

119
00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.209
Look at those kids.

120
00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.110
(They charge their energy with their fans.)

121
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.610
1, 2, 3!

122
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.649
- Let's go, April! - Let's go, April!

123
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.390
(Bowling)

124
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.430
It's 2018 Idol Star Athletics Championships - New Year Special.

125
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.029
The first game for the semifinals...

126
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.360
of Men's Bowling.

127
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.159
The players are entering.

128
00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.070
Joo Heon and Min Hyuk of MONSTA X.

129
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.339
He bowls dynamically. That's nice.

130
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.209
(Starting with Min Hyuk of MONSTA X's strike,)

131
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.409
(strikes continue to be made!)

132
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.649
(He gets the first double strike in the championships' bowling record.)

133
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.550
Just look at that.

134
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.990
(MONSTA X sets the first turkey record too.)

135
00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.089
The second team is EXO and Trax.

136
00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.690
(Chan Yeol of EXO and Jay of Trax.)

137
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.000
(Everyone acknowledges that EXO and Trax are the heavy favorites.)

138
00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.760
- That's good. - That's good indeed.

139
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.300
(They beat Wanna One and moved on to the semifinals.)

140
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.870
(He bowled two clean strikes!)

141
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.140
EXO and Trax move on to semifinals...

142
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.779
with the score of 158.

143
00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.380
(EXO and Trax got the highest score among 8 teams.)

144
00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:00.390
(MONSTA X versus EXO and Trax)

145
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.089
This is the first match of semifinal.

146
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.159
The first bowler is...

147
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.260
Chan Yeol from EXO.

148
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.200
Here goes the first bowl.

149
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.430
He powerfully threw the ball.

150
00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:15.700
(Though it was well-aimed, he failed to bowl a strike.)

151
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.000
If he hit the head pin, it would have been a strike.

152
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.200
(EXO and Trax versus MONSTA X)

153
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.039
It was a powerful throw.

154
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.610
Next up is Jay, a skilled bowler.

155
00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:27.050
- Jay has been doing a great job. - He has.

156
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.050
In the preliminaries.

157
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.209
All right.

158
00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:37.219
It fell into the gutter.

159
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.390
The ball must have slipped off his hand.

160
00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:41.329
The first throw from MONSTA X.

161
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:43.959
- Min Hyuk. - Min Hyuk.

162
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.099
He carefully throws the ball.

163
00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.269
It went too far to the left.

164
00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:55.240
(MONSTA X is also...)

165
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.279
(not doing a great job.)

166
00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.209
And the second throw ends as well.

167
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.479
Both teams are in a dead heat.

168
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.750
That's right. The score is 14 to 16.

169
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.860
(It's Chan Yeol's turn again.)

170
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.360
Chan Yeol.

171
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.800
- Is it returning? - Is it returning?

172
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.959
(9 pins)

173
00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:21.200
(He failed bowling a strike.)

174
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.099
- The 10 pin was left. - I thought it was a strike.

175
00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:28.039
- He starts to get the hang of it. - It seems like it.

176
00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:32.809
- It was very close. - It was a fantastic spin.

177
00:08:34.449 --> 00:08:35.610
Goodness.

178
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.049
It would've been nice if there was more pin action.

179
00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.890
Then he could have hit the last pin too.

180
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.159
- Min Hyuk. - Min Hyuk.

181
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.720
- Very good. - It looks very good.

182
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.059
(7 pins)

183
00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:49.230
It's a little disappointing.

184
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.860
Will he get to pick up the spares?

185
00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:54.500
- Very good. - Good.

186
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.669
Good job!

187
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.340
- Very good. - Good.

188
00:08:58.439 --> 00:08:59.470
They are a good team.

189
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.569
- Very good. - Good.

190
00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:03.210
They are a good team.

191
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.480
He did a great job.

192
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.140
(MONSTA X now leads the game thanks to Joo Heon.)

193
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.549
Finally someone picked up a spare.

194
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.679
It was a clean hit.

195
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.120
- It was a clean and perfect hit. - He did a great job.

196
00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:16.090
It seems like the longer they play,

197
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.059
the better their posture becomes.

198
00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:21.490
It was an accurate hit.

199
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.760
You're now watching the first match of the semifinals...

200
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.130
in 2018 Idol Star Athletics Championships.

201
00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:31.699
Chan Yeol.

202
00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:35.909
- It looks nice. - Good job.

203
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.480
Is it a strike?

204
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.179
(It was so close.)

205
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.049
It was a great throw.

206
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.949
The ball was spinning too fast...

207
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.949
that it couldn't hit the 9 pin.

208
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.860
It should have hit the 9 pin.

209
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.890
Chan Yeol seems to be disappointed.

210
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.689
Now they have the 9 pin left.

211
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.730
It's Jay's turn.

212
00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:00.059
He's gazing at the 9 pin.

213
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.529
He's so determined to hit the pin.

214
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:05.439
There he goes.

215
00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:08.870
(Nice!)

216
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.939
- Did he throw it all right? - There it goes!

217
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.340
He successfully picks up a spare!

218
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.210
Did he throw it all right? Here it goes!

219
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.610
He successfully picks up a spare!

220
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.850
- He doesn't let us down. Clean hit. - It was a clean hit.

221
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.449
EXO and Trax also scored a spare.

222
00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.789
It's a very close match.

223
00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:29.789
Min Hyuk will throw in the fourth frame.

224
00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:31.130
Min Hyuk.

225
00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:34.500
- It looks nice. - It looks nice.

226
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.470
(It's a strike.)

227
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.169
- It looks nice. - It looks nice.

228
00:10:40.169 --> 00:10:41.309
It's a strike!

229
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:44.510
This is the first strike.

230
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.580
(It's the first strike of this match.)

231
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.380
Right after scoring a spare,

232
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.149
they scored a strike.

233
00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:53.890
This is the first strike of this match.

234
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.019
Once they start bowling a strike, they keep bowling strikes.

235
00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:58.860
- That's true. - They have more frames to go.

236
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.019
Chan Yeol, you can do it.

237
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.730
What about Chan Yeol now?

238
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.760
(Swaying)

239
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.360
This is the fifth frame of the semifinal.

240
00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:08.269
Chan Yeol.

241
00:11:13.169 --> 00:11:15.809
(It's a strike.)

242
00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:18.409
(See?)

243
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.909
That was a great counterattack.

244
00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:21.110
(EXO and Trax versus MONSTA X)

245
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.510
- This is... - They caught up with them.

246
00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:27.289
He bowled a strike in response to a strike.

247
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.250
Strangely, this is how things usually go.

248
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.760
They can't let their opponent lead the game.

249
00:11:32.789 --> 00:11:35.890
Chan Yeol's strike makes the game even now.

250
00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:39.199
His posture looks stable and comfortable.

251
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.830
(The ball hit the pins accurately.)

252
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.230
His ball went through the 1 and 3 pins.

253
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.199
It was a very accurate hit.

254
00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:45.799
It was an ideal hit.

255
00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:47.740
This is what you call...

256
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.809
- a strike. - A strike.

257
00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:49.809
It is indeed.

258
00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.140
Will he make it?

259
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.240
(EXO and Trax are now on fire!)

260
00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:54.880
Good job.

261
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.189
(They slowly widen the score gap.)

262
00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:05.419
(It's now MONSTA X's turn.)

263
00:12:05.819 --> 00:12:08.029
- It hit the pins. - It's a successful spare.

264
00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:09.059
It hit the pins.

265
00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:12.600
(MONSTA X catches up with them, by scoring a spare.)

266
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.929
- They catch up to their opponent. - It's a close match.

267
00:12:15.929 --> 00:12:18.640
When one catches the other, the other runs away. This is exciting.

268
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:20.569
- It's Jay's turn. - Yes.

269
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:21.840
(Jay throws the ball in frame 7.)

270
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.039
It should spin. It should spin.

271
00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:26.880
It should spin. It should spin.

272
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.350
(It falls into the gutter.)

273
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.610
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

274
00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.419
It should spin. It should spin.

275
00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:34.649
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

276
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.559
Jay is a skilled bowler, but...

277
00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:39.590
It's all right.

278
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.789
(What a relief.)

279
00:12:40.789 --> 00:12:41.789
(They feel relieved.)

280
00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.460
Let's see if Chan Yeol can make up for it.

281
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.529
(7 pins)

282
00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:49.830
He scores only seven points.

283
00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:52.199
(Disappointed)

284
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.569
It's MONSTA X's turn in the seventh frame.

285
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.210
- Joo Heon. - Joo Heon.

286
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.949
It's going a bit far too the right.

287
00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:03.309
Very good!

288
00:13:03.309 --> 00:13:04.350
(Sad)

289
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.090
Actually, this is...

290
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.120
a big chance for MONSTA X.

291
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.590
- Right. - You're right.

292
00:13:11.019 --> 00:13:12.419
- That was nice. - It looks nice.

293
00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.460
(Oh, no!)

294
00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:16.360
- That was nice. - It looks nice.

295
00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:18.360
(He failed to pick up the spares.)

296
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.769
(Disappointed)

297
00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:23.269
(The audience feels bad for him.)

298
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.600
He missed one pin.

299
00:13:24.669 --> 00:13:26.669
Although he failed to pick up the spares,

300
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.510
- They almost caught up with them. - they almost caught up with them.

301
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.010
It's a really close match.

302
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.480
The score gap is only two points.

303
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.080
MONSTA X scored 80 points...

304
00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:37.419
while EXO and Trax scored 82 points.

305
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.080
It's a very close match.

306
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.250
Now, they have only three frames left.

307
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.360
(They have only 3 frames left.)

308
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.159
Nice. There you go.

309
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.559
How does it look?

310
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.130
That was so close.

311
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.269
That was so close.

312
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.199
It was not the 10 pin.

313
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.340
It looks like the 7 pin.

314
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.669
The 7 pin is left.

315
00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:04.010
I think they can hit it.

316
00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:07.480
Will Chan Yeol pick up a spare?

317
00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:11.319
- I wonder... - He looks serious.

318
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.689
Will it hit the 7 pin?

319
00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:20.689
It should've gone further.

320
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.529
- He missed it. - He missed it.

321
00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:28.699
(It's hard to predict who will be the winner.)

322
00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:31.600
- It's the eighth frame. - It's Joo Heon's turn.

323
00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:34.210
- Will he... - Let's go!

324
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.710
- It's a strike! - He scores a strike.

325
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.710
(He widens the score gap again.)

326
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.279
- That was awesome. - He did a great job.

327
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.880
- It's a strike! - He scores a strike.

328
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.649
- That was awesome. - He did a great job.

329
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.029
(It's another chance for MONSTA X to turn the tide.)

330
00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:55.490
They almost caught up with their opponent now.

331
00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:59.529
The difference between their scores is only one point.

332
00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:01.870
- MONSTA X scored 90 points, - 90 points.

333
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.600
while EXO and Trax scored...

334
00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.240
- 91 points. - 91 points.

335
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.439
(Their score difference is now only 1 point.)

336
00:15:08.439 --> 00:15:09.569
The score is...

337
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.080
We can't help it. It's a competition.

338
00:15:12.939 --> 00:15:15.250
There's one point difference. And the ninth frame begins.

339
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.919
It's Jay's turn.

340
00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:18.120
(The ninth frame begins.)

341
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.580
It's Jay's turn. It looks good.

342
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.350
Is it a strike? It's a strike!

343
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.519
It's a strike again!

344
00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:23.819
(Yes!)

345
00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:29.029
- It's a strike! - It's a strike again!

346
00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.330
How is this possible?

347
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.299
It seems like a strike leads to another strike.

348
00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:34.600
It seems like it.

349
00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.539
It's like, "Did you bowl a strike? Me too."

350
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:41.840
Jay looks like an experienced bowler.

351
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.210
In the eighth frame, he powerfully threw the ball,

352
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.850
- leaving the 7 pin. - Right.

353
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.649
Then he adjusted it a bit...

354
00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:53.480
and ended up bowling a clean strike.

355
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.419
His face looks like an experienced bowler's face.

356
00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:58.419
- Each team scored two strikes. - Right.

357
00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:01.860
Now, it's MONSTA X's turn.

358
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.029
They just scored a strike.

359
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.929
They changed the bowler now.

360
00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:08.330
- It's Min Hyuk's turn. - Yes.

361
00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:11.169
He threw the ball with confidence.

362
00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.569
That's a little disappointing.

363
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.179
Let's see if Joo Heon can pick up the spares.

364
00:16:18.939 --> 00:16:21.409
It seems like Joo Heon starts...

365
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.080
- to feel nervous. - Right.

366
00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:25.580
He's become more serious.

367
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.590
The key is to hit the head pin.

368
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.789
He's focused.

369
00:16:30.049 --> 00:16:31.559
He must hit the head pin.

370
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.390
(The ball passed by the head bin.)

371
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.760
One pin remains.

372
00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:38.899
He almost made it.

373
00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:41.330
So by adding 9 more bonus points to the 9 points he just earned,

374
00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:44.539
he added a total 18 points.

375
00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:48.610
They just finished the ninth frame.

376
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.539
MONSTA X scored 108 points.

377
00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:55.250
EXO and TRAX scored 101 points.

378
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:59.279
It's important that EXO did a strike earlier.

379
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:01.489
They will be able to receive extra points.

380
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.719
No one knows what will happen.

381
00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:04.790
I'm nervous.

382
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.419
That's right. We only have the last frame left.

383
00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:08.590
- I'm so nervous. - Yes, I'm nervous.

384
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.199
I don't know why I'm nervous when I'm not even playing.

385
00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:15.229
Who will be the first team to advance to the final round?

386
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.239
Please stay tuned to see the results.

387
00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:19.969
(Deep breath)

388
00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:23.209
It's the last frame.

389
00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:24.909
It's Chan Yeol.

390
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:27.249
(The first throw of the last frame.)

391
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.449
He started.

392
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.449
- Nice. - That's good.

393
00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.020
- That was good. - Did he do a good job?

394
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.520
- That is good. - Did he do a good job?

395
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.320
- That is good. - Did he do a good job?

396
00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:39.719
(Men's Bowling Team Event Semifinals EXO and Trax versus MONSTA-X)

397
00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:41.090
- It was a good throw. - He is good indeed.

398
00:17:41.429 --> 00:17:42.790
Good throw.

399
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.560
- The 10 pin is left again. - Yes.

400
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.830
I think people will start hating the 10 pin.

401
00:17:47.969 --> 00:17:50.439
The nasty 10 pin is still there.

402
00:17:50.439 --> 00:17:55.239
But EXO and Trax has Jay.

403
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.310
Will he be able to hit a spare...

404
00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.040
and earn a bonus frame?

405
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.820
- It's an important moment. - It's very important.

406
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.520
- It's important. - Okay.

407
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.820
- That's good. - It looks good.

408
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.060
(Spare)

409
00:18:11.259 --> 00:18:13.590
- That's good. - It looks good.

410
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.090
- He hit a spare. - Oh, my.

411
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.530
- He finally hit it. - He did.

412
00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:21.830
- That's amazing. He earned a bonus. - Yes.

413
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.530
That was really amazing.

414
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.169
How could he hit it so dramatically?

415
00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:27.209
- I don't know. - It was so close.

416
00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:30.880
- That's amazing. - He hit it precisely.

417
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.239
EXO and Trax scored 121 points.

418
00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:36.209
They have a bonus frame left.

419
00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:39.620
Their victory depends on it.

420
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.850
It's very important.

421
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.550
- If MONSTA X... - I'm starting to sweat.

422
00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:46.860
wants to make a chance to win, they must hit two strikes in a row.

423
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.030
(They will have a chance if they hit a strike or a spare.)

424
00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:52.100
How will it go?

425
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.199
It's the last frame, frame 10.

426
00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:56.669
The opponent team is also nervous.

427
00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:57.800
What will be the results?

428
00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.340
Okay.

429
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.669
(The dice has been thrown.)

430
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:03.880
- He hit it. - Wait a minute.

431
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.050
Okay.

432
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.380
- That wasn't bad. - Come on.

433
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.550
(6 pins)

434
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.179
(MONSTA X missed the chance to score a high score.)

435
00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:15.149
I guess it wasn't strong enough.

436
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:17.259
(Relieved)

437
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.560
The pins didn't fall enough compared to his accurate throw.

438
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.499
Joo Heon is up for their last turn.

439
00:19:24.499 --> 00:19:26.560
- There's a split left. - Yes.

440
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.330
Joo Heon must hit a spare.

441
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.169
- They'll have a chance only then. - That is correct.

442
00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:35.540
He must hit a spare.

443
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.739
Let's trust Joo Heon.

444
00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:45.850
- That's nice. - Will he hit a spare?

445
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.790
(Please)

446
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.989
(That was so close.)

447
00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:53.290
- Oh, my. - He should've hit a spare.

448
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.689
- That's nice. - Will he hit a spare?

449
00:19:55.689 --> 00:19:58.929
(Oh, my.)

450
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.530
MONSTA X is finished.

451
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.110
They ended the game with 117 points.

452
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.340
(It's okay, you did a good job.)

453
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.340
- It was almost a split. - Yes.

454
00:20:12.009 --> 00:20:14.310
He would've done it if it moved just a little bit to the right.

455
00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:16.209
- It was such a close hit. - It was so close.

456
00:20:16.209 --> 00:20:18.780
- That's too bad. - That's too bad.

457
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.290
EXO and Trax must finish their bonus frame.

458
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.189
Let's watch.

459
00:20:24.719 --> 00:20:28.689
Chan Yeol is doing his best until the end.

460
00:20:28.689 --> 00:20:29.790
(Chan Yeol's bonus frame)

461
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.330
It's Chan Yeol.

462
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.669
He threw it carefully.

463
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.969
Good posture. It's a strike! Good job.

464
00:20:35.969 --> 00:20:36.969
- It's a strike. - Gosh.

465
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.370
That was good.

466
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.239
I'm still hungry.

467
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.909
- He hit a strike in the end. - Yes.

468
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.409
I'm still hungry.

469
00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:46.880
That was amazing.

470
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.380
How does he do this?

471
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.350
This is the first team to advance to the final round.

472
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.620
It was a close match, and they showed an amazing game.

473
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.090
MONSTA X scored 117 points.

474
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.330
EXO and Trax scored 131 points.

475
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.199
EXO and Trax will advance to the final round.

476
00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:06.159
(EXO and Trax will advance to the final round.)

477
00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:09.270
(Who will go against EXO and Trax?)

478
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.469
(Will it be strike baby ASTRO?)

479
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.209
(They hit spares precisely.)

480
00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.749
(The king of spares, KNK?)

481
00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:28.020
(ASTRO versus KNK)

482
00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:31.459
KNK, please tell us about your teamwork.

483
00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:33.159
Let us show our teamwork.

484
00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:34.929
Do you like to dip or pour the sauce on your tangsuyuk? 1, 2, 3.

485
00:21:34.929 --> 00:21:36.130
- I like to dip it. - I like to dip it.

486
00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.459
- That's cool. - They're well suited.

487
00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:40.159
(Even their taste matches perfectly.)

488
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.270
I'm warning you.

489
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.370
(I'm warning you.)

490
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.469
This was MC Hani.

491
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.810
MBC.

492
00:21:51.739 --> 00:21:53.649
(Hani is the best.)

493
00:21:53.649 --> 00:21:56.409
Hani, thank you.

494
00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.320
The atmosphere was nice...

495
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.249
between the two teams.

496
00:22:03.249 --> 00:22:06.290
Now, we will start the second semifinals match.

497
00:22:06.989 --> 00:22:10.330
Jeong In Seong was very good.

498
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.530
- He became the dark horse. - That's right.

499
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.770
- It's almost there. - Gosh.

500
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.999
It's a good start.

501
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.140
- It's a strike. - Oh, my. It's a strike.

502
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.469
(Strike)

503
00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:20.610
He's starting with a strike.

504
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.640
- He's in his prime. - Yes, he's in his prime.

505
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.979
Will he continue to be like this?

506
00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:28.149
Yes, he continued...

507
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:30.380
to deal spares from the preliminaries.

508
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.219
He now hit a strike from the start.

509
00:22:32.949 --> 00:22:35.949
- That's amazing. - Let's look at him.

510
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.189
It went through the 1 and 3 pins.

511
00:22:41.189 --> 00:22:43.030
- That was a good throw. - Yes.

512
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.330
- It's a good throw. - It's a good throw.

513
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.969
- Rocky. - Rocky.

514
00:22:47.969 --> 00:22:51.169
- They're cheering for Rocky. - Rocky.

515
00:22:52.199 --> 00:22:53.540
It's Rocky's turn.

516
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.340
(Rocky throws straightforward.)

517
00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.979
- Oh, my. - That's good.

518
00:22:57.979 --> 00:22:59.709
(9 pins)

519
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.409
- One more. - Yes.

520
00:23:01.409 --> 00:23:03.009
(A controlled ceremony)

521
00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:05.550
He did a controlled ceremony.

522
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.290
It's a chance to hit a spare. Eun Woo is up for this one.

523
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.759
- Hit it. - Hit it.

524
00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:14.759
(You have to hit a spare.)

525
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.199
His team members...

526
00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:21.429
- are pressuring him innocently. - Yes.

527
00:23:21.429 --> 00:23:25.070
You can't say anything to them when they're so innocent like that.

528
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.739
(He throws the ball with pressure on his shoulders.)

529
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.310
(The ball ends up in the gutter.)

530
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.509
- It ended up in the gutter. - It's okay.

531
00:23:31.509 --> 00:23:33.850
- It's okay. - It's okay.

532
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.149
- I think he slipped in the end. - Yes.

533
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:39.449
They hit a strike from the start.

534
00:23:39.449 --> 00:23:41.419
That's why the order changed.

535
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.459
Okay.

536
00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:46.090
(6 pins)

537
00:23:49.989 --> 00:23:51.030
It's Jeong In Seong.

538
00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:54.199
(He hit a clean spare.)

539
00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.800
- Jeong In Seong did it. - That was amazing.

540
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.270
- Jeong In Seong is too good. - What is wrong with him today?

541
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.409
He never misses his target.

542
00:24:01.409 --> 00:24:03.840
Jeong In Seong is amazing.

543
00:24:05.209 --> 00:24:06.810
It's Oh Hee Jun's turn.

544
00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:07.880
Okay.

545
00:24:10.479 --> 00:24:11.719
- Will it fall? - Oh, my.

546
00:24:11.719 --> 00:24:12.850
(He scored an extra point because the pin got caught.)

547
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.689
- The pin actions are helping them. - Yes.

548
00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:17.959
- Isn't that right? - Yes.

549
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.159
It's Jeong In Seong's turn.

550
00:24:20.429 --> 00:24:22.189
- Will he get a clean hit? - Will he be able to do it?

551
00:24:22.429 --> 00:24:23.999
(He succeeds again.)

552
00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:25.999
Jeong In Seong is amazing today.

553
00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:27.729
(He's true to his name, the king of spares.)

554
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.439
- He's so good. - Yes, he's good at hitting spares.

555
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.169
He's really good.

556
00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:36.870
It's Rocky, who has become serious.

557
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.979
He's very serious.

558
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.550
(He throws heavily for the second time.)

559
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.249
- That's good. - Gosh.

560
00:24:43.249 --> 00:24:44.979
(8 pins)

561
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.350
(Cha Eun Woo's turn)

562
00:24:48.919 --> 00:24:51.419
- Will it hit the pins? - It's dangerous.

563
00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:52.560
(His ball ends up in the gutter two times in a row.)

564
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.290
This always makes things unpredictable.

565
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.860
- It's okay. - It's okay.

566
00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:58.159
(Cha Eun Woo continues to be in a slump.)

567
00:24:58.159 --> 00:24:59.759
- Will it hit the pins? - It's dangerous.

568
00:25:03.229 --> 00:25:04.340
It's going in.

569
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.340
(He continues to make mistakes because of the pressure.)

570
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.669
- Is he feeling pressured? - Yes, he must feel pressured.

571
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:11.439
(ASTRO is having a hard time.)

572
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.409
(It is frame 5 now.)

573
00:25:15.509 --> 00:25:20.449
(KNK earned more than double scores because of their victories.)

574
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.030
(Will ASTRO be able to catch up?)

575
00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.030
It's Rocky's turn.

576
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.060
Okay.

577
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.300
- That's good. - That's good.

578
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.469
(Something feels extraordinary.)

579
00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:38.340
- That's good. - That's good.

580
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.709
- It's going well. - It's a strike.

581
00:25:42.709 --> 00:25:45.080
- Yes. - It's a strike.

582
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.239
(All pins are knocked down.)

583
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:51.350
- Yes. - It's a strike.

584
00:25:51.979 --> 00:25:53.149
(ASTRO turns the table with a strike.)

585
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:54.949
- They did it. - That was good.

586
00:25:55.949 --> 00:25:57.959
(He does a new ceremony.)

587
00:25:57.959 --> 00:26:00.060
- That's a new ceremony. - Yes.

588
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.830
- It makes me feel so good. - Yes.

589
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.630
(Rocky hit a strike at the most needed moment.)

590
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.969
Since ASTRO is trying to catch up, KNK must do their best...

591
00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:09.899
- to widen the distance. - That's right.

592
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.469
Frame six is very important.

593
00:26:12.469 --> 00:26:14.509
They start by changing the competitor.

594
00:26:15.469 --> 00:26:18.040
It's going to change.

595
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.439
(Oh Hee Jun's throw wasn't satisfactory.)

596
00:26:19.439 --> 00:26:22.880
Jeong In Seong will try to hit a spare now.

597
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.249
He has to hit a spare.

598
00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.449
That's right.

599
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.259
(He fails to hit a spare.)

600
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.090
- That was difficult. - Yes, it was a difficult spare.

601
00:26:33.989 --> 00:26:36.759
He just wants to hit eight pins.

602
00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:37.959
- Cha Eun Woo. - Cha Eun Woo.

603
00:26:37.959 --> 00:26:39.100
(Deep breath)

604
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.070
This is the sixth frame of ASTRO.

605
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:43.669
Is ASTRO's time back?

606
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:44.969
He's Cha Eun Woo.

607
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.840
He threw the ball gently.

608
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.209
- Is it spinning? - It's going.

609
00:26:48.209 --> 00:26:49.439
He's Cha Eun Woo.

610
00:26:49.439 --> 00:26:50.509
He threw the ball gently.

611
00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:52.009
- Is it spinning? - It's going.

612
00:26:55.649 --> 00:26:57.449
(It's another strike!)

613
00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:59.479
- It's double. - That's right.

614
00:26:59.479 --> 00:27:01.120
(Eun Woo of ASTRO redeems his mistakes with a double strike.)

615
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.520
It's a double strike.

616
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.959
He released his thumb a little late.

617
00:27:06.719 --> 00:27:08.090
It was a double strike.

618
00:27:08.929 --> 00:27:12.630
As he bowled strikes in frames 5 and 6,

619
00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.130
we can't predict the results.

620
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.969
It's in the mist now.

621
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.709
(KNK should extend their lead now.)

622
00:27:20.709 --> 00:27:23.239
- That was good. - It looks great.

623
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.709
(7 pins)

624
00:27:27.709 --> 00:27:30.749
But KNK has Jeong In Seong.

625
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.550
(KNK fails to pick up a spare.)

626
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.890
He must've felt pressured.

627
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.020
(KNK fails to pick up a spare.)

628
00:27:38.489 --> 00:27:41.030
They've added a lot of scores.

629
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.899
This frame is very important for ASTRO.

630
00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:48.630
- Would it be a turkey? - Would he bowl a turkey?

631
00:27:49.399 --> 00:27:51.540
- Is it coming back? - It's coming back.

632
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.340
- Is it coming back? - It's coming back.

633
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.570
- Would it be a turkey? - Would he bowl a turkey?

634
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.310
- Is it coming back? - It's coming back.

635
00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.380
Would he bowl a turkey?

636
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.850
(8 pins)

637
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.449
- Eun Woo bowls for the spares. - For the spares.

638
00:28:03.719 --> 00:28:05.820
If he picks up the spares, he'll tie the game.

639
00:28:07.449 --> 00:28:08.489
(It was a close fail.)

640
00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:10.919
- That's too bad. - It was so close.

641
00:28:10.919 --> 00:28:12.120
They're only one point apart.

642
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.860
ASTRO is just one point behind now.

643
00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.659
The score is 93 to 94.

644
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.429
KNK is only one point ahead.

645
00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:21.899
(It's only 1 point apart.)

646
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.499
- A double strike is very powerful. - Exactly.

647
00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:26.040
All right.

648
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.870
(In frame 9, KNK...)

649
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.270
- It looks good. - That's it.

650
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.179
(fails to pick up spares again.)

651
00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:36.050
This is a great chance for ASTRO to turn the game around.

652
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.149
- An opportunity to overtake. - It sure is.

653
00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:41.090
He's Rocky, the cheerful guy.

654
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.459
- It's Rocky. - Would he turn the game around?

655
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.459
- It looks great. - What?

656
00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:51.560
Here...

657
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.330
(9 pins)

658
00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:55.870
He scored nine points.

659
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.439
(It's okay.)

660
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.810
It's a tie now.

661
00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.509
- That's right. - They tied the game.

662
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:07.310
It's a tie as Rocky knocked down nine pins.

663
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:11.219
It depends on Eun Woo now.

664
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.489
Would he be able to pick up a spare?

665
00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:18.060
- This frame will be the watershed. - I think so.

666
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.219
How would it go?

667
00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:20.729
(Everyone is watching it with bated breath.)

668
00:29:20.729 --> 00:29:21.890
How will it go?

669
00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:24.729
What will it be?

670
00:29:25.499 --> 00:29:26.600
What will it be?

671
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.300
It's getting close.

672
00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.100
It's getting close.

673
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.009
(Spare)

674
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.080
(ASTRO turned the game around.)

675
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.550
ASTRO turned the game around by picking up a spare.

676
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.149
He hit the spare accurately.

677
00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:51.459
The cheering squad is very excited.

678
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.890
This is the last frame.

679
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.659
- ASTRO finally overtook the game. - It's the last chance for KNK.

680
00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.229
It's Frame 10.

681
00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:01.270
Oh Hee Jun, you can do this.

682
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.330
Good luck!

683
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.909
(KNK lost the lead right before the last frame.)

684
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:09.939
- This is an important moment. - I'm so nervous.

685
00:30:09.939 --> 00:30:13.649
He's Oh Hee Jun. This is very important.

686
00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:14.810
It's important.

687
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.380
(Would they be able to take back the lead?)

688
00:30:18.949 --> 00:30:20.449
It's turning left.

689
00:30:21.749 --> 00:30:24.060
- It's not so bad though. - Right.

690
00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:27.759
KNK has to pick up the spares here...

691
00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:30.499
- like ASTRO just did. - That's right.

692
00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:34.030
This is a crucial moment. He's Jeong In Seong.

693
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.969
Jeong In Seong has played well.

694
00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:39.100
(The master of spares throws the ball to bowl the last spares.)

695
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.199
(He fails.)

696
00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:42.739
- He failed to pick up the spares. - That's too bad.

697
00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:44.909
They finished the game like that.

698
00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:48.249
KNK scored 109 points.

699
00:30:48.979 --> 00:30:51.419
That's their final score.

700
00:30:51.419 --> 00:30:54.449
It's ASTRO's turn for Frame 10.

701
00:30:54.449 --> 00:30:57.320
- Rocky! - Rocky!

702
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.390
They are currently six points apart.

703
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.860
(They are only 6 points apart.)

704
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.429
The result has not been decided yet.

705
00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:06.600
He's Rocky.

706
00:31:07.229 --> 00:31:10.100
- Rocky. - Go, Rocky.

707
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.770
- It's good. - Rocky...

708
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.199
It's pretty good.

709
00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:15.509
He knocked down eight pins.

710
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.479
The game is decided now.

711
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.479
(Eun Woo tries to make the end well by picking up the spares.)

712
00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:23.310
It's Eun Woo's finish.

713
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:25.320
Would he be able to bring the game to a successful conclusion?

714
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.649
It looks good.

715
00:31:26.649 --> 00:31:27.820
(Spare)

716
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.919
He did it.

717
00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:31.560
It's good that they try their best until the last moment.

718
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.959
It was perfect.

719
00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:36.489
Eun Woo is handsome and a good bowler.

720
00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:38.300
- That's right. - Isn't he?

721
00:31:39.699 --> 00:31:41.199
(Before the main matches,)

722
00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:43.169
(they recharge their energies.)

723
00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.800
(The athletes fill their stomachs.)

724
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.870
(Thank you for the food.)

725
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.909
(The girls look excited when they eat.)

726
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.749
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

727
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.459
(She's pretty even when she eats.)

728
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.060
(Taking a big bite)

729
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:17.100
Women's Archery Team Event will begin shortly.

730
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.140
(Goyang Gymnasium)

731
00:32:18.499 --> 00:32:20.509
2018 Idol Star...

732
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.370
Athletics Championships.

733
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.479
This is the Women's Archery Team Event.

734
00:32:26.709 --> 00:32:28.080
She's here again.

735
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.580
She's the gold medalist of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

736
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:33.590
It was 22 years ago.

737
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.749
- She's Commentator Yoon Hye Young. - It's nice to meet you.

738
00:32:35.749 --> 00:32:38.659
Hello, I'm Commentator Yoon Hye Young.

739
00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:41.390
She hasn't changed since the Atlanta Olympics.

740
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.790
- She's changed a little bit. - Thank you.

741
00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:44.130
I think...

742
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.169
this will be a big match.

743
00:32:47.229 --> 00:32:51.040
I know all the idol groups are very busy,

744
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.610
but these two teams are the busiest.

745
00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:59.140
Despite their busy schedules, they practiced a lot.

746
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.780
These two teams are here...

747
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.280
looking for a chance to redeem themselves.

748
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.489
They want to revenge their former defeats.

749
00:33:07.489 --> 00:33:08.749
You know what?

750
00:33:08.749 --> 00:33:11.560
It breaks my heart that one of the two teams...

751
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.520
must be defeated.

752
00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:16.090
I understand how you feel.

753
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.830
The match between these two teams will be the battle of the century.

754
00:33:20.229 --> 00:33:22.699
Commentator Yoon, how do you think this game would turn out?

755
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.399
For Red Velvet,

756
00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:28.540
the members who are on their upturn...

757
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.840
- are playing in the game today. - I see.

758
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.649
I'd say they're the ace archers of Red Velvet.

759
00:33:34.649 --> 00:33:38.520
Meanwhile, TWICE showed outstanding concentration during practice.

760
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.949
Tzuyu is well known...

761
00:33:41.949 --> 00:33:44.060
for her stable position.

762
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.520
She's also the strongest member in her team.

763
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.729
As far as I remember, Tzuyu showed a very stable position.

764
00:33:51.899 --> 00:33:53.530
As for Red Velvet,

765
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.199
Irene becomes determined...

766
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.870
once the game begins.

767
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.999
She's smiling now, but she becomes scary.

768
00:33:59.999 --> 00:34:01.909
- She looks different. - She becomes cold-hearted.

769
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.640
She's acting cute now, but...

770
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.480
- She's not acting cute. - She is cute.

771
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:08.609
- But she changes. - Right.

772
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.549
You can watch this match...

773
00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:13.690
between TWICE and Red Velvet only on Idol Star Athletics Championships.

774
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.020
- That's right. - Please stay tuned.

775
00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.420
Women's Archery Team Event.

776
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.960
The first match of Preliminary Group One begins now.

777
00:34:21.129 --> 00:34:23.029
It's TWICE versus Red Velvet.

778
00:34:23.029 --> 00:34:24.299
(TWICE versus Red Velvet)

779
00:34:24.299 --> 00:34:28.400
Da Hyun of TWICE goes first.

780
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.529
(2 shots of 3 archers of each team plus the last shot of ace archers)

781
00:34:29.529 --> 00:34:31.299
Da Hyun goes first.

782
00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:32.699
It's TWICE.

783
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:35.069
Their fans are cheering for them ardently.

784
00:34:35.609 --> 00:34:37.739
Red Velvet's fans are just as passionate.

785
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.049
This is like a match between Korea and Japan.

786
00:34:41.049 --> 00:34:42.549
This is so exciting.

787
00:34:42.549 --> 00:34:45.080
Goyang Gymnasium is all fired up.

788
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.290
- It's Seul Gi versus Da Hyun. - That's right.

789
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.719
This match is something you can watch only in our show.

790
00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.259
The first shot is very important.

791
00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.690
(Letting out a sigh)

792
00:34:57.159 --> 00:34:59.199
- She must be very nervous. - She looks nervous.

793
00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:02.830
They're fighting for their pride.

794
00:35:02.929 --> 00:35:04.339
- Exactly. - That's what matters.

795
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.069
Da Hyun is experienced.

796
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:11.440
But she has ups and downs. That's her weakness.

797
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.540
This is like Ronaldo versus Messi.

798
00:35:14.549 --> 00:35:17.379
(What would Da Hyun's first shot be like?)

799
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:18.719
- She shot it. - Yes.

800
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.520
- 9 points! - It's 9 points.

801
00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:23.719
- My gosh. - It's a good start. Nine points.

802
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.589
She got off with a flying start.

803
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:28.029
She did a good job with her first shot.

804
00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:29.529
Da Hyun scored nine points.

805
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.830
It's Seul Gi's turn now.

806
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.370
(It's Seul Gi's turn.)

807
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.569
She looks calm.

808
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.109
She shot it.

809
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:43.540
- Oh no. - It's five points.

810
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.040
- It's 5 points. - Is it 5 points?

811
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.640
- It's 5 points. - I see.

812
00:35:46.909 --> 00:35:47.949
It's okay.

813
00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.350
She feels sorry.

814
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.890
Da Hyun is having a hard time keeping a straight face.

815
00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:56.420
- She's very happy now. - That's right.

816
00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.759
- But she shouldn't be too excited. - Exactly.

817
00:35:58.759 --> 00:36:00.219
She has to stay calm.

818
00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:01.589
Her opponent shot five points.

819
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:03.390
It means she can shoot five points too.

820
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.460
It's very...

821
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:09.199
- lame. - She shot it.

822
00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:10.900
- She shot five points. - What?

823
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:12.140
- It's lame. - She shot it.

824
00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.040
- She shot five points. - What?

825
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.409
- I told you. - It's your fault.

826
00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:16.409
See? I told you.

827
00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:18.310
It's your fault. You shouldn't have said that.

828
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.140
Seul Gi is in the same agency with you.

829
00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.679
- He should keep his mouth shut. - You're being biased.

830
00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:23.620
- This isn't about my agency. - She's from your agency.

831
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.020
You wanted Da Hyun to shoot five points, didn't you?

832
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.020
That's not true.

833
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.520
I can't believe this.

834
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.790
This is unbelievable.

835
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.219
He can't do this as a commentator.

836
00:36:32.219 --> 00:36:33.890
- We should be careful. - He's being mean.

837
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.159
This is what he intended.

838
00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:37.529
I'm telling you I didn't intend anything.

839
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.230
She shot five points just like he said.

840
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.230
Did my prediction come true?

841
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.230
- How did this happen? - Is it because of the prediction?

842
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.569
It's another chance for Seul Gi.

843
00:36:45.699 --> 00:36:47.969
- This is what we call sports. - This is a match between rivals.

844
00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:49.409
(How many points will Seul Gi get in her second shot?)

845
00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:51.909
- She shot it. - She shook a little bit.

846
00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:54.549
- She scored three points. - Seul Gi,

847
00:36:54.549 --> 00:36:57.449
- it's okay. - Yes.

848
00:36:57.449 --> 00:36:58.920
If this happens,

849
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.989
their will to chase after their opponent decreases.

850
00:37:01.989 --> 00:37:04.089
But the competitor will change now.

851
00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:06.259
That's right. It's Na Yeon's turn.

852
00:37:06.259 --> 00:37:08.960
However, I can say this for sure. We are commentators,

853
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.060
but this gives energy even to us.

854
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.400
Teuk, I'm very disappointed in you.

855
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.500
I'm sorry.

856
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.799
(What will Na Yeon's first shot be like?)

857
00:37:21.009 --> 00:37:22.710
(Shaking)

858
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.710
- She's shaking. - Yes, she shook a lot.

859
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.379
- Look at that. - What happened?

860
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.580
- What did we say earlier? - It's five points.

861
00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.379
If I shoot 3 points, I will shoot 3 points again.

862
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:33.150
- Yes, that's right. - As soon as that was said,

863
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.750
she shot the same score too.

864
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.420
But she shot five points.

865
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.060
They must be very nervous because it's such a big match.

866
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.929
- It's Ye Ri. She shot it. - She shot it.

867
00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:42.960
- It's 5 points. - It's 5 points.

868
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.330
- It's five points. - I don't know if I'm allowed...

869
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.069
to say this, but the arrows are everywhere.

870
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:48.429
They're everywhere.

871
00:37:48.429 --> 00:37:49.799
They're in east, west, south, and north.

872
00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:52.940
- Yes, it's entertaining. - They're everywhere.

873
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.670
Please make a bet with your family on where the arrows will land.

874
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.080
(Na Yeon's last shot)

875
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.250
It's Na Yeon's turn.

876
00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.179
- It's Na Yeon, she shot it. - Yes.

877
00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:03.949
- It's 8 points. - It's 8 points.

878
00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:06.120
- She shot well. - Yes, she shot well.

879
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.219
- Her members are cheering. - She is probably starting...

880
00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.989
to feel urgent.

881
00:38:09.989 --> 00:38:11.460
The game is already halfway through.

882
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.589
(Pressured)

883
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:15.790
She has to focus more at a moment like this.

884
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.900
- It's a four-point difference. - Yes.

885
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.900
(Let's calm down.)

886
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.969
(What will be the score of Ye Ri's last shot?)

887
00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:24.699
- Ye Ri needs to be a little calm. - She shot it.

888
00:38:24.699 --> 00:38:27.170
- It's 6 points. - It's 6 points.

889
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.839
- The arrows are everywhere. - Yes.

890
00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:31.940
This time, she shot it towards the top.

891
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.580
It's Tzuyu, the prettiest member of TWICE.

892
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.650
Bo Mi, the prettiest member of Apink acknowledged this fact.

893
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.920
(Will Tzuyu finalize the victory?)

894
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.080
Will Tzuyu finalize the victory? She's the ace of her team.

895
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.650
I thought she was a mannequin standing there.

896
00:38:43.819 --> 00:38:45.790
Look at her posture.

897
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.029
- It's nine points. - She's good.

898
00:38:48.029 --> 00:38:51.600
She's eliminating her opponent's will to chase them.

899
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.000
Good scores come from good posture.

900
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.770
- That's right. - Bo Mi is complimenting her.

901
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.500
Irene came out.

902
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.799
It's a match between the prettiest member of Red Velvet...

903
00:38:59.799 --> 00:39:02.370
- and the prettiest member of TWICE. - She's the prettiest among TWICE.

904
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:04.879
And the prettiest member of Apink is commenting.

905
00:39:04.879 --> 00:39:07.210
- That's right. - It's a battle among beauties.

906
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.750
- You can't see this anywhere else. - I can't believe this.

907
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:11.879
It's Irene's turn.

908
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.390
The look in her eyes changed.

909
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.960
(What will be Irene's first score?)

910
00:39:18.719 --> 00:39:19.719
She shot it.

911
00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:21.159
- That's good. It's 6 points. - It's 6 points.

912
00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:22.429
It's six points.

913
00:39:22.529 --> 00:39:24.060
The game isn't important.

914
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.199
Red Velvet doesn't shoot above the blue, they only shoot...

915
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:30.100
- 6, 5, and 3 points. - It's okay.

916
00:39:30.199 --> 00:39:33.170
We're satisfied to just see this match.

917
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.609
- I just like this match. - Yes.

918
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.040
- I love this match. - It's Tzuyu's turn.

919
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.350
- Come on. - What do you mean by "come on"?

920
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.009
I think I'm too excited.

921
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.379
It's Tzuyu.

922
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.420
Tzuyu has good facial expressions too.

923
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.850
(What will Tzuyu's score be?)

924
00:39:48.049 --> 00:39:49.120
- Okay. - Okay.

925
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.460
- Isn't she so pretty? - She has two shots left.

926
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.960
- It's 9 points. - It's 9 points.

927
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.960
- Isn't she so pretty? - She has two shots left.

928
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.330
- It's 9 points. - It's 9 points.

929
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.529
She doesn't move.

930
00:39:55.529 --> 00:39:58.830
- Tzuyu is the ace of TWICE. - That's right.

931
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.230
I think the winner of the game has been decided.

932
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.029
- Yes. - It's a 20 point difference.

933
00:40:03.029 --> 00:40:05.969
It's almost over, but we just checked the score right now.

934
00:40:06.199 --> 00:40:07.940
- It's okay. - Yes.

935
00:40:08.509 --> 00:40:10.210
- You should enjoy the game. - Yes, you should enjoy it.

936
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.109
- Winning isn't important. - You have to enjoy.

937
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:16.049
- It's the holidays. - Yes. I'm excited.

938
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.580
Please don't give up...

939
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.719
- Of course. - until the end.

940
00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:23.960
The look in Irene's eyes has changed as I said.

941
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.089
- Did she shoot? - Yes, it's seven points.

942
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:27.859
- It's seven points. - Good job.

943
00:40:28.529 --> 00:40:31.159
- They're not shooting accurately. - Something is not right.

944
00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:33.569
- It's not easy. - They have to shoot well...

945
00:40:33.569 --> 00:40:36.370
to have good results next year.

946
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:38.370
It's Tzuyu's turn.

947
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:39.799
(Tzuyu's last arrow to highlight the end.)

948
00:40:39.853 --> 00:40:44.253
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] MBC E02 2018 Idol Star Athletics Championships New Year Special</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

949
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.640
Nine points.

950
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.250
(9 points)

951
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.179
Aren't those 9 points almost like 10 points?

952
00:40:49.179 --> 00:40:51.549
Tzuyu, thank you very much.

953
00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:53.350
- "Thank you"? - Yes, thank you.

954
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.949
- I heard you spoke some Chinese. - Yes, thank you.

955
00:40:55.949 --> 00:40:57.120
Your pronunciation is disappointing.

956
00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.620
- Thank you. - Yes.

957
00:40:59.819 --> 00:41:02.429
It's 54 points against 32 points.

958
00:41:02.489 --> 00:41:04.230
It's a 22 point difference.

959
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.900
- It's a record. - Yes.

960
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.469
There's one shot left.

961
00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:10.600
- Please do your best until the end. - Of course.

962
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.770
Winning isn't important.

963
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.569
The fans are also saying that it's okay.

964
00:41:13.569 --> 00:41:15.170
- It's a festival. - They're cheering for her too.

965
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.909
- It's not important. - Yes.

966
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.779
It's her turn now.

967
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.810
(What will Irene's last score be?)

968
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:24.549
Will it bring them to a successful conclusion?

969
00:41:25.319 --> 00:41:26.719
- Is it 9 points? - Yes, it's 9 points.

970
00:41:26.719 --> 00:41:28.120
It's nine points. She did a good job.

971
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.650
Red Velvet brought themselves to a successful conclusion.

972
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:33.560
- It's 54 points against 41 points. - Yes.

973
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.460
With a 13 point difference,

974
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.330
TWICE will advance to the semifinals.

975
00:41:39.929 --> 00:41:42.270
Mi Na is preparing to go next.

976
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.040
(Group Two, Gugudan versus DIA)

977
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.440
- It's 8 points. - It's 8 points.

978
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.600
They have to chase them.

979
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:49.069
- That's good. - That's good.

980
00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.239
Is that okay?

981
00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:52.739
(Gugudan almost loses because of Hye Yeon's mistake.)

982
00:41:52.739 --> 00:41:54.580
- No one knows what will happen. - Is it four points?

983
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.750
She doesn't move.

984
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.279
(But because of Na Young's remarkable shooting)

985
00:41:57.279 --> 00:41:59.379
- It's 10 points. - Okay.

986
00:41:59.819 --> 00:42:02.750
- That's too bad. - Gugudan won.

987
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.020
- She shot it. - It's 10 points.

988
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.060
That's right.

989
00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.730
- She's doing good. - The score went up.

990
00:42:08.929 --> 00:42:11.259
(Yoo Ji Ae and Baby Soul didn't do well in the beginning.)

991
00:42:12.799 --> 00:42:14.929
- It's nine points. - Oh, my.

992
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.239
- It's nine points. - That's right.

993
00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:19.370
Okay.

994
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.170
- She shot it. - It's nine points.

995
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.440
- It's a one point difference. - Oh My Girl won.

996
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.080
Oh My Girl advanced to the semifinals.

997
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.080
(TWICE versus Gugudan)

998
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.589
(Oh My Girl versus GFRIEND)

999
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:36.920
(2018 Idol Star Athletics Championships, New Year Special)

1000
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.819
We will start the game of Group One...

1001
00:42:39.819 --> 00:42:41.890
for the semifinals of the women's archery team event.

1002
00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:45.100
The teams are Oh My Girl and GFRIEND.

1003
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.799
GFRIEND is a strong player.

1004
00:42:47.799 --> 00:42:48.830
That's right.

1005
00:42:48.929 --> 00:42:50.400
- Yes. - They're in first place.

1006
00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.540
(They dominated the front-runner, EXID, last year.)

1007
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.909
She did well.

1008
00:42:56.170 --> 00:43:00.379
(GFRIEND became the new queen of archery.)

1009
00:43:00.379 --> 00:43:02.409
Oh My Girl issued a challenge to them.

1010
00:43:02.409 --> 00:43:03.980
Yes, Oh My Girl did.

1011
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.589
- Look at the cheering. - The cheering is intense.

1012
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:12.319
It's Yoo A from Oh My Girl.

1013
00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:13.929
(Group One, Ye Rin versus Yoo A)

1014
00:43:13.929 --> 00:43:15.460
According to my memory,

1015
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.859
- Yoo A's shots are very stable. - That's right.

1016
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.000
- She's very calm. - Yoo A is about to shoot.

1017
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.299
(Yoo A's first shot)

1018
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.469
The look in her eyes is very confident.

1019
00:43:27.909 --> 00:43:32.310
- She shot it. - It's 10 points.

1020
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.679
It's 10 points.

1021
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.750
She's very stable.

1022
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:38.150
GFRIEND will feel pressured this way.

1023
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.219
Yes, they will.

1024
00:43:39.219 --> 00:43:41.190
But Ye Rin shoots well too.

1025
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:42.890
- Yes, she shoots well. - Ye Rin is really good.

1026
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:44.319
Ye Rin shoots well.

1027
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:47.589
- She's very calm. - That's right.

1028
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:50.159
(Calm Ye Rin's first shot)

1029
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.529
- Ye Rin. - She shot it.

1030
00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:52.799
- It's 8 points. - It's 8 points.

1031
00:43:52.799 --> 00:43:54.629
- That's good. - She shot well.

1032
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.400
I guess this is the match between the aces of each team.

1033
00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.469
That's right.

1034
00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:01.770
She's usually very cute and adorable.

1035
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:04.640
But the look in her eyes becomes cold when she does archery.

1036
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.940
She becomes cold.

1037
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.480
(What will cold Yoo A's second shot be like?)

1038
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.449
- Yes. - That's good.

1039
00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:12.850
- Is it 8 points? - Yes, it's 8 points.

1040
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.219
She feels bad.

1041
00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.989
- 10 points will make a tie. - She's very different.

1042
00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:18.620
She's different. She's usually very cheerful.

1043
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.960
She's very calm right now.

1044
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.190
- She's cold. - She shot it.

1045
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.929
- Is it 10 points? - Yes, it's 10 points.

1046
00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:24.129
- She's cold. - She shot it.

1047
00:44:24.129 --> 00:44:25.730
- Is it 10 points? - Yes, it's 10 points.

1048
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.129
- It's a tie. - Gosh.

1049
00:44:27.129 --> 00:44:29.129
- Yes. - It's 18 points against 18 points.

1050
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.940
She looks like a general.

1051
00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.069
- Next. - Yes.

1052
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:35.170
- I told you that Ye Rin was good. - Yes.

1053
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.409
She scores 10 points by drawing an arc.

1054
00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:38.909
It hit the center.

1055
00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.379
It's Binnie versus Um Ji now.

1056
00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.850
- Binnie is good. - She is.

1057
00:44:45.879 --> 00:44:47.890
- It's 9 points. - It's 9 points.

1058
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.750
- She's doing well. - She's challenging herself.

1059
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.259
Will Um Ji do a good job again?

1060
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:55.359
- She shot it. - It's eight points.

1061
00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.659
The game is halfway through. It's Binnie's turn.

1062
00:44:57.659 --> 00:44:58.699
Okay.

1063
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:00.969
- It's 7 points. - It's 7 points.

1064
00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:03.870
GFRIEND has another chance because of this.

1065
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.239
- It's 9 points. - It's 9 points.

1066
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.239
- That means... - They won.

1067
00:45:11.239 --> 00:45:12.310
- It's a come-from-behind victory. - It's a come-from-behind victory.

1068
00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:15.009
GFRIEND is ahead by one point.

1069
00:45:15.009 --> 00:45:17.319
- It's a neck to neck match. - That's right.

1070
00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:19.319
I've never seen her like this.

1071
00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:20.819
- She looks very cold. - Yes.

1072
00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:23.089
- She shot it. - It's nine points.

1073
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:25.159
- That was beautiful. - She did a good job.

1074
00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:26.929
She shot it.

1075
00:45:27.429 --> 00:45:28.759
- It's 8 points. - It's 8 points.

1076
00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.960
- It's Eun Ha. - That means...

1077
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.529
- they tied with 43 points. - It's a tie.

1078
00:45:33.629 --> 00:45:34.830
(It's Seung Hee's second shot while they're in a tie.)

1079
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.239
- Her members are cheering for her. - She shot it.

1080
00:45:37.239 --> 00:45:39.370
- It's 10 points. - Gosh.

1081
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.609
What will happen?

1082
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:43.009
- It's Eun Ha. - She needs to chase them.

1083
00:45:43.009 --> 00:45:44.210
(The second shot of Eun Ha, who needs to chase them)

1084
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.440
There's a 10 point difference.

1085
00:45:45.739 --> 00:45:46.879
She shot it.

1086
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.549
- It's eight points. - That's okay.

1087
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:50.179
- We don't know yet. - She has one more shot left.

1088
00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:52.650
Their destiny will be decided after just one shot.

1089
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:53.790
It's Seung Hee.

1090
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.089
Will she finalize the victory or give them another chance?

1091
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:57.589
She's the last competitor.

1092
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.290
- It's 7 points. - Is it 7 points?

1093
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.359
- Seven points mean... - We don't know yet.

1094
00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:04.400
That's right. They still have a chance.

1095
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.759
(Deep breath)

1096
00:46:05.759 --> 00:46:08.029
They will win if she shoots 10 points.

1097
00:46:08.029 --> 00:46:09.670
They will have overtime if she shoots nine points.

1098
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:13.569
(What will GFRIEND's destiny be like?)

1099
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.770
- It's nine points. - What happened?

1100
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:18.310
- Is it 9 points? It's 9 points. - It seems like 9 points.

1101
00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:20.210
They will advance to the next round...

1102
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.480
if it's 10 points, but they'll have overtime if it's 9 points.

1103
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.620
- She's checking. - It looks like nine points.

1104
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.179
- It's 9 points. - It's 9 points.

1105
00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:27.520
It's a tie.

1106
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.319
- It's overtime. - It's overtime.

1107
00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:31.060
- It's a shoot-off. - I can't believe this.

1108
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.120
- Isn't it a shoot-off? - Yes.

1109
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.259
Please explain what it is.

1110
00:46:33.259 --> 00:46:35.359
- What will happen? - If they shoot the same score,

1111
00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:38.000
they will each have a chance to shoot once more.

1112
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
So each of them will shoot once more,

1113
00:46:40.299 --> 00:46:43.400
and if it's a tie again, they will shoot again.

1114
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.199
But if one of them win here,

1115
00:46:45.199 --> 00:46:47.310
- that team will be the winner? - Yes, they will be the winner.

1116
00:46:47.739 --> 00:46:49.140
This is so cruel.

1117
00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.009
They each get another chance.

1118
00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:52.310
This shot will decide their destiny.

1119
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.679
- Who is shooting for GFRIEND? - It's Um Ji.

1120
00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:57.219
- Um Ji. - It's Um Ji. I see.

1121
00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.350
Seung Hee is coming out.

1122
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.690
It seems like Seung Hee will be shooting for Oh My Girl.

1123
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.890
Both of them look determined.

1124
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:05.890
They look determined.

1125
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.390
This one shot will finish the game.

1126
00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:09.359
The first one to shoot...

1127
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.929
is Seung Hee.

1128
00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:12.629
(Seung Hee will shoot the arrow first.)

1129
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.770
(Nervous)

1130
00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:16.370
Seung Hee will go first.

1131
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.710
She carefully pulls back her bow.

1132
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:21.839
(Seung Hee carefully pulls back the bow.)

1133
00:47:25.179 --> 00:47:28.009
(Please)

1134
00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:31.750
(How many points will she score?)

1135
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.190
She shot the arrow.

1136
00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.420
- She scored 10 points! - 10 points!

1137
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.920
She scored 10 points!

1138
00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.120
- She shot the arrow. - She scored 10 points!

1139
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.859
(One is sad while the other is happy.)

1140
00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:42.659
Now, there's nothing more she can do.

1141
00:47:43.529 --> 00:47:44.730
She did a great job.

1142
00:47:45.129 --> 00:47:47.000
They should be called "Oh My Gosh", not Oh My Girl.

1143
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
- This is "OMG" - "OMG".

1144
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.699
Under big pressure, she scored 10 points.

1145
00:47:50.699 --> 00:47:52.739
- She scored 10 points. - She did a great job.

1146
00:47:53.339 --> 00:47:55.239
She almost broke the camera lens.

1147
00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:57.839
The arrow flew and precisely hit the target.

1148
00:47:58.179 --> 00:48:00.179
GFRIEND can score 10 points too.

1149
00:48:00.179 --> 00:48:01.480
They can do it.

1150
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.819
If GFRIEND scores 10 points,

1151
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.750
it will be a historical moment of Idol Star Athletics Championships.

1152
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.890
- Um Ji. - Um Ji can do it too.

1153
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.089
Um Ji is also a very calm player.

1154
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.330
(If she doesn't score 10 points, her team will lose.)

1155
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.460
Um Ji.

1156
00:48:16.259 --> 00:48:17.699
This is the last shot.

1157
00:48:17.699 --> 00:48:18.730
(This last shot will decide their destiny.)

1158
00:48:19.859 --> 00:48:23.500
(It's incredibly tense.)

1159
00:48:24.299 --> 00:48:26.170
(Where will the last shot lead them to?)

1160
00:48:28.569 --> 00:48:29.609
She shot the arrow.

1161
00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.040
Is it nine points?

1162
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.449
It doesn't matter if it's 8 or 9. The game is now over.

1163
00:48:34.449 --> 00:48:39.819
Seung Hee's last shot led to Oh My Girl's victory.

1164
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.989
With the great last shot,

1165
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.989
Oh My Girl moves into the finals.

1166
00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:45.489
No one expected this.

1167
00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:46.560
(Oh My Girl moves into the finals.)

1168
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:48.560
You're now watching Women's Archery Team Event.

1169
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.500
Group Two will now begin the semifinal match.

1170
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.299
The players are TWICE and Gugudan.

1171
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.730
The first player from TWICE is obviously Da Hyun.

1172
00:48:57.799 --> 00:48:59.770
(Da Hyun versus Na Young)

1173
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.870
The audience is cheering loud.

1174
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:03.980
(The match begins with intense cheering.)

1175
00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.879
They look like excited soldiers.

1176
00:49:07.379 --> 00:49:09.549
(How will her first shot go?)

1177
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:10.580
I wonder how it'll go.

1178
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.620
She shot her arrow.

1179
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.219
- She scored 4 points. - 4 points.

1180
00:49:13.219 --> 00:49:15.190
- What was that? - Four points.

1181
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:18.460
It seems like she shot it too early before aiming right.

1182
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.989
It seems like it. She must be a little nervous.

1183
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.190
It's Na Young's turn now.

1184
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:24.830
Gugudan starts the match with their best player.

1185
00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.900
Na Young scored 9 and 10 points earlier.

1186
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.299
(How will Na Young's shot go?)

1187
00:49:30.299 --> 00:49:31.940
Na Young is a very stable player.

1188
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.469
She must be feeling quite easy.

1189
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.710
10 points!

1190
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:38.279
- 10 points! - She scored 10 points.

1191
00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:39.879
- See? - It's a smooth start.

1192
00:49:40.449 --> 00:49:42.409
The fans are so mature.

1193
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.150
They cheer for the players.

1194
00:49:44.379 --> 00:49:46.250
No matter which team they cheer for,

1195
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.420
they keep quiet when the player pulls back the bow.

1196
00:49:51.719 --> 00:49:54.489
- It's Da Hyun's turn. - Everyone stays quiet.

1197
00:49:54.489 --> 00:49:55.730
(Da Hyun's second shot)

1198
00:49:57.029 --> 00:50:00.000
- She scored 9 points! - 9 points. She's back again.

1199
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.299
TWICE has a lot of ups and downs.

1200
00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:06.069
- It's hard to predict their result. - You're right.

1201
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:08.509
It's Na Young's turn. She's very calm.

1202
00:50:08.509 --> 00:50:10.140
(Na Young's second shot)

1203
00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.739
- It looks good. - She looks stable.

1204
00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:13.009
- Oh, no. - That was close.

1205
00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:14.879
- Did she score 7 points? - Yes, 7 points.

1206
00:50:14.879 --> 00:50:17.420
Then they don't have a huge point gap.

1207
00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.850
- There's only 4 points difference. - There's 4 points difference.

1208
00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.650
(Na Yeon versus Se Jeong)

1209
00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:22.819
She shot the arrow.

1210
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.859
- She scored 10 points! - 10 points!

1211
00:50:25.359 --> 00:50:26.520
She shot the arrow.

1212
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.529
- She scored 10 points! - 10 points!

1213
00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.359
She scored 10 points.

1214
00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:32.359
TWICE is a scary team.

1215
00:50:32.359 --> 00:50:33.870
It's hard to predict what they will do.

1216
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:36.730
Na Yeon scored 10 points from the beginning.

1217
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.699
She scored 10 points.

1218
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.370
It's Se Jeong's turn now.

1219
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.679
It's her first shot.

1220
00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:48.310
(How many points will she score?)

1221
00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.279
- There she goes. - She scored eight points.

1222
00:50:51.449 --> 00:50:52.819
- Good. - It's not bad.

1223
00:50:52.819 --> 00:50:54.290
She did a good job.

1224
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.259
With the score of 23 to 25,

1225
00:50:57.259 --> 00:50:59.560
Gugudan is leading the game.

1226
00:50:59.989 --> 00:51:02.230
- She should keep up her pace. - Right.

1227
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.500
She shot her arrow.

1228
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.929
- Is it 7 points? - She scored 7 points.

1229
00:51:06.929 --> 00:51:07.929
She did a good job.

1230
00:51:07.929 --> 00:51:10.000
It becomes harder and harder to predict the result.

1231
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.969
It's hard to predict how many points TWICE will score.

1232
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.109
We don't know what to expect.

1233
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:17.279
Was that from a song?

1234
00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:20.480
Thanks for the song.

1235
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.710
I did that to entertain our senior viewers.

1236
00:51:22.909 --> 00:51:24.750
(Se Jeong's second shot)

1237

- It's a really close match. - She scored eight points twice.

1240
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.560
They couldn't run so far away.

1241
00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.429
The score is 30 to 33.

1242
00:51:34.429 --> 00:51:36.830
- They have three shots left. - Here comes Tzuyu.

1243
00:51:36.929 --> 00:51:38.500
The next player from TWICE is Tzuyu.

1244
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.969
We can expect a high score from her.

1245
00:51:40.969 --> 00:51:42.529
You're right. She's an ace.

1246
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.270
It looks like we're having Premier League here.

1247
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.770
Their cheering is as loud as...

1248
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:53.210
the audience cheering for Manchester United in Premier League.

1249
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.810
They keep cheering.

1250
00:51:54.909 --> 00:51:56.009
Tzuyu.

1251
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.080
- She's a stable player. - She's an ace.

1252
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.350
She scored nine points.

1253
00:52:01.449 --> 00:52:02.650
She's an ace indeed.

1254
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.790
- TWICE will now catch up with them. - They will.

1255
00:52:06.759 --> 00:52:08.129
(How many points will Hye Yeon score?)

1256
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.000
- She scored 10 points. - 10 points.

1257
00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:14.199
(They're excited.)

1258
00:52:14.199 --> 00:52:15.969
Hye Yeon scored 10 points.

1259
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:17.199
Hye Yeon is an ace.

1260
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.569
This frustrates TWICE, who wanted to catch up to them.

1261
00:52:21.569 --> 00:52:23.170
- Look. - She scored 10 points.

1262
00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.779
- She scored indeed 10 points. - She's good at dealing with crises.

1263
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.679
(Tzuyu's second shot)

1264
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.949
- There she goes. - She scored eight points.

1265
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:31.980
Eight points.

1266
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.150
It's a little disappointing.

1267
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.290
- She could've scored 10. - It's a little disappointing.

1268
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.759
They still have one more shot left.

1269
00:52:37.759 --> 00:52:40.290
It's very likely that Tzuyu is their last player.

1270
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:41.529
Hye Yeon is a good player.

1271
00:52:41.529 --> 00:52:44.560
Hye Yeon looks incredibly calm.

1272
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.730
Will she get to run away or keep being chased?

1273
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.529
(Her first shot was 10 points. How will it go this time?)

1274
00:52:52.199 --> 00:52:53.500
- 10 points! - 10 points!

1275
00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.909
She's incredible.

1276
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:57.440
- 10 points! - 10 points!

1277
00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.179
- She's incredible. - Hye Yeon is amazing.

1278
00:53:00.179 --> 00:53:01.710
She scored 10 points in a row.

1279
00:53:02.049 --> 00:53:04.449
- She scored 10 points in a row. - 10 points in a row.

1280
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.489
The score is 47 to 53.

1281
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:10.460
Now, only 7 points are between their scores.

1282
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.290
The last player is Tzuyu.

(Will Tzuyu's last shot lead her team to the finals?)

1284
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.929
Will they make it to the finals?

1285

(Will Tzuyu's last shot lead the team to the finals?)

1286
00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:23.199
(Smiling)

1287
00:53:23.529 --> 00:53:24.839
- What was that smile? - Nine points.

1288
00:53:24.839 --> 00:53:26.199
She scored nine points.

1289
00:53:26.239 --> 00:53:27.810
- She scored 9 points with a smile. - She scored 9 points.

1290
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:29.670
It's too early to give up hope.

1291
00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:32.509
Maybe she sensed something was going wrong.

1292
00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:33.909
She smiled before she shot the arrow.

1293
00:53:34.279 --> 00:53:36.650
Why did she smile? What's the meaning of the smile?

1294
00:53:38.219 --> 00:53:39.980
Who are you talking to?

1295
00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.190
I'm talking to Tzuyu, but she's not answering.

1296
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:43.520
I should have asked her in Chinese.

1297
00:53:43.659 --> 00:53:45.560
- I'm sorry. - It's Hye Yeon's turn.

1298
00:53:47.759 --> 00:53:49.129
Unless something comes up...

1299
00:53:49.129 --> 00:53:54.270
Unless she scores under three points...

1300
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:55.529
The arrow slipped off.

1301
00:53:58.299 --> 00:53:59.739
The arrow slipped off.

1302
00:53:59.799 --> 00:54:01.469
- She should be careful. - She has to shoot in 20 seconds.

1303
00:54:01.469 --> 00:54:04.580
If she gets disqualified, her team will lose.

1304
00:54:05.839 --> 00:54:07.250
She scored nine points.

1305
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:08.850
Gugudan is the winner.

1306
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:12.449
Hye Yeon stayed calm...

1307
00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:15.650
until the end.

1308
00:54:16.049 --> 00:54:18.819
The final score is 56 to 62. Leading the score by 6 points,

1309

Which teams are playing in Men's Archery Team Event?

1315
00:54:33.569 --> 00:54:35.909
I'd like to say they're all amazing.

1316
00:54:35.909 --> 00:54:39.679
It'd be sad if these guys are not in archery games. BTOB and Vixx.

1317
00:54:39.679 --> 00:54:42.909
Seventeen, a strong competitor, and MONSTA X joins as well.

1318
00:54:42.909 --> 00:54:45.020
Vernon from Seventeen...

1319
00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.350
- is a great player. - He is indeed.

1320
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:48.150
Even though it's their first time for some teams,

1321
00:54:48.449 --> 00:54:50.190
they raise our expectations.

1322
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:53.859
NU'EST, Up10tion, and NCT127 are joining the match too.
