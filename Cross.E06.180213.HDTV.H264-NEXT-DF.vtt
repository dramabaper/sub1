<i>[The characters, groups, places and
situations in this drama are fictional.]</i>

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.140
<i>If you hadn't brought the child,
I wouldn't have let you off easily.</i>

5
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.275
Do a good job.

6
00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:27.574
<i>He's usually really prickly,
yet he's really good to his patients.</i>

7
00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:28.586
<i>Like someone else I know.</i>

8
00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:31.494
<i>That bastard Kang In Kyu didn't
go to that prison for no reason.</i>

9
00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:33.335
<i>Our boss is in danger right now.</i>

10
00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:35.845
Don't take it any further,
and don't get involved in it.

11
00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:37.467
<i>I have to catch him.</i>

12
00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.162
If I don't, there will always be
more victims like my dad.

13
00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.250
<i>It will put you in danger too.</i>

14
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.153
<i>Don't you think the center chief
has been strange lately?</i>

15
00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:48.752
Kang Dae Soo?
That's the bastard I killed.

16
00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:51.253
[Son: Kang In Kyu]
"Son, Kang..." Kang In Kyu?

17
00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:55.055
This is Doctor Kang In Kyu,
he came from a university hospital.

18
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.805
It's true that your parents are having
a hard time because of you.

19
00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:03.180
But if something bad happens to you,
they'll have an even harder time.

20
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.077
Can't you visit her
yourself and help her?

21
00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:09.169
The patient or guardian
must come here in person

22
00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.868
or if you talk to the doctor
in charge, they'll give us a call.

23
00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.749
<i>[Episode 6]</i>

24
00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.849
<i>[Son]</i>

25
00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:22.514
This is Kang In Kyu.

26
00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.200
Doctor Kang.

27
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.748
What brings you
to the social welfare center?

28
00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:52.349
Oh, I wanted to ask
about medical fee support.

29
00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.039
Medical fee support?

30
00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.207
Ji Young is really stressed
about her medical fees.

31
00:02:57.207 --> 00:03:00.759
She's worried that her parents
are suffering because of her.

32
00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.359
Really?

33
00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.658
It's better to not know about
such things when you're little.

34
00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:09.974
Do you happen to know how I can help her?

35
00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:12.575
I was actually concerned
since her mother is worried

36
00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:14.374
about the medical expenses.

37
00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:21.253
Um, Patient Yoon Ji Young is
in Ward 11, Room 2, right?

38
00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:24.902
- Yes.
- Register her for medical fee support

39
00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:28.253
with my name and check if there are
other support programs for her, please.

40
00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:30.152
So that she can continue
to receive support.

41
00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:31.354
Sure.

42
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.450
What is this?

43
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.600
<i>[Son]</i>

44
00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:11.234
Why is Doctor Kang saved
as "Son" on your phone?

45
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:15.361
Sit down. I'll explain everything.

46
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:18.762
Is he really your son?

47
00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.688
Dad, did you have another woman?
Is that why you divorced Mom?

48
00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:27.202
- It wasn't like that.
- Then what is it?

49
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.411
After you and your mom left

50
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:34.611
I adopted him, as a foster father.

51
00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:36.111
What did you say?

52
00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.698
He was taking care of his sick
little sister, without any parents.

53
00:04:39.698 --> 00:04:42.298
I adopted them because they would've
died if I had just left them alone.

54
00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:44.171
Dad, are you in your right mind?

55
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.871
Don't you know how
Mom and I felt when we left?

56
00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:50.784
I know.

57
00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:52.784
Then how could you adopt another child?

58
00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:55.284
Did you pity him, but not us?

59
00:04:56.313 --> 00:05:00.512
I was sick too.
I was so sick, I could've died.

60
00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:02.313
But what did you say to me?

61
00:05:02.313 --> 00:05:05.813
You told me to go
to the hospital and get surgery!

62
00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.710
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.279
I didn't know you were
that sick at the time.

64
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.419
I'm sure you didn't, since your family
always came after everything else.

65
00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.529
You know about your patient's
illnesses, but not your family's.

66
00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:23.827
Back then, what I needed...

67
00:05:23.827 --> 00:05:26.775
wasn't a doctor, it was you, Dad.

68
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.060
I needed my dad, who gave me strength...

69
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.777
just by being by my side.

70
00:05:57.676 --> 00:06:01.476
Come in, so you don't regret it.
I came here to see you.

71
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.250
I thought this was
the only way I could see you.

72
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.250
Doctor Kang In Kyu.

73
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.250
You're thankful, aren't you?

74
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.250
Thank you.

75
00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.988
Then buy me a coffee.

76
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:37.991
At that cafe over there.

77
00:06:43.058 --> 00:06:46.868
I just want an Americano.
What about you, Doctor Kang?

78
00:06:46.868 --> 00:06:48.666
I'll have the same, please.

79
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.650
I want this too.

80
00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:03.214
Please put it on the same bill.

81
00:07:17.714 --> 00:07:19.498
It's sweet.

82
00:07:20.238 --> 00:07:23.916
- Try some. It's delicious.
- I'm fine.

83
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.849
It's really good though.

84
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.200
Yeon Hee.

85
00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.044
Oh, Joo Hyuk.

86
00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:02.637
I didn't expect to see you two together.

87
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.226
What brings you
to our hospital at this hour?

88
00:08:08.207 --> 00:08:09.839
Joo Hyuk, you know
about it too, don't you?

89
00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:13.161
Doctor Kang found an emergency
patient on the streets yesterday.

90
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:16.646
That patient is hospitalized
in Ward 11 right now.

91
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.900
I know.

92
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.400
I waited for two hours thanks to him.

93
00:08:22.549 --> 00:08:24.750
Gosh, don't be like that, Joo Hyuk.

94
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.348
The patients are safe and sound
thanks to Doctor Kang.

95
00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:30.699
That's just the outcome.

96
00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:33.870
If he doesn't follow basic rules,
the outcome won't be good every time.

97
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.370
I apologize for that.

98
00:08:38.847 --> 00:08:40.592
I'll be going now.

99
00:08:40.592 --> 00:08:42.390
Oh, already?

100
00:08:58.294 --> 00:09:01.294
<i>[Son]</i>

101
00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:13.797
<i>- Did you call?</i>
- Yes.

102
00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:15.044
Have you decided?

103
00:09:15.044 --> 00:09:16.614
<i>Regarding what?</i>

104
00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:19.208
Didn't you call me to talk about
my offer to work under me?

105
00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.650
- No.
- Then?

106
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.606
<i>I called you by accident.</i>

107
00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:27.816
<i>I wasn't kidding.</i>

108
00:09:27.816 --> 00:09:31.414
If you don't come out on your own,
I'll force you out of there.

109
00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:03.419
How do you know the center chief?

110
00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:05.595
I just happen to know him.

111
00:10:05.595 --> 00:10:08.419
He was taking care of his sick
little sister, without any parents.

112
00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:11.121
I adopted them because they
would've died if I had left them alone.

113
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.159
My one and only little sister...

114
00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:22.659
was a brain-dead organ donor
when she passed away.

115
00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:27.458
Without my consent, and just
the consent of my foster father.

116
00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:33.943
<i>Could Dad have done that?</i>

117
00:10:45.674 --> 00:10:47.274
4713.

118
00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:53.534
It's time for your meds.

119
00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:20.160
Wider.

120
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:23.419
Okay.

121
00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.770
<i>[Conventional Treatments
for Chronic Renal Failure]</i>

122
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.712
<i>If he takes the medicine
for a few more days</i>

123
00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:47.472
<i>his liver and kidney functions will
be damaged, causing complications.</i>

124
00:11:47.472 --> 00:11:52.119
<i>If he also has mental fog
and hepatic encephalopathy</i>

125
00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:55.119
<i>it's highly likely
that he won't recognize me.</i>

126
00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:04.735
Line up!

127
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.413
Move!

128
00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:31.381
Good going!

129
00:12:35.082 --> 00:12:36.582
Hyung Bum.

130
00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:39.130
Come with me.

131
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:43.361
Come in here. Come in.
Come in. Hurry. Hurry.

132
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.678
Geez, I won't take it from you.

133
00:12:53.678 --> 00:12:54.880
Let me see.

134
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.750
Is it good?

135
00:13:01.693 --> 00:13:03.905
Don't your parents deposit
spending money for you?

136
00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:06.725
My dad withdrew my money because of
my diabetes and high blood pressure

137
00:13:06.725 --> 00:13:08.207
to stop me from snacking.

138
00:13:09.577 --> 00:13:14.294
Your dad must be pretty powerful
if he can withdraw your money.

139
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.244
I... I didn't mean that he withdrew it.

140
00:13:17.244 --> 00:13:19.943
I meant that he didn't deposit
it in the first place. I said it wrong.

141
00:13:21.448 --> 00:13:24.414
Sung Ho, if you have diabetes
and high blood pressure

142
00:13:24.414 --> 00:13:26.715
- you must take a lot of medicine.
- I do.

143
00:13:26.715 --> 00:13:28.914
I take seven pills, three times a day.

144
00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:33.039
4817.

145
00:13:34.832 --> 00:13:37.288
Let's make a deal.

146
00:13:37.288 --> 00:13:40.035
A... a deal? What kind of deal?

147
00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:42.034
I'll pay you 1000 won per pill.

148
00:13:42.034 --> 00:13:45.741
If you give me 30 pills, let me think...

149
00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:47.812
What the heck. I'll give you 50,000 won.

150
00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:51.135
- That's awesome.
- Isn't it?

151
00:13:51.135 --> 00:13:55.784
But since I can't give it to you in cash,
I'll buy you everything you want.

152
00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:57.183
Re... really?

153
00:13:57.683 --> 00:13:59.427
Were you tricked all your life?

154
00:14:01.102 --> 00:14:02.602
Eat.

155
00:14:22.105 --> 00:14:23.505
What's this?

156
00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:26.505
I made it for you
during job preparation class.

157
00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:29.837
So we can share a celebratory drink
when I'm released next month.

158
00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:35.236
Are you still talking about drinking?

159
00:14:39.707 --> 00:14:43.226
Is it okay for you to bring such
things to me without permission?

160
00:14:43.226 --> 00:14:44.625
No.

161
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.562
Leave it.

162
00:14:54.948 --> 00:14:57.948
Your glucose levels have gone up.
Your blood pressure did too.

163
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.904
Are you eating something else these days?

164
00:15:00.904 --> 00:15:02.404
No... no.

165
00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:04.553
Then why is it so high today?

166
00:15:04.553 --> 00:15:08.879
The thing is, I think I should
increase my daily pill intake.

167
00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:10.438
Why?

168
00:15:10.438 --> 00:15:13.433
Well, I've been getting
headaches these days

169
00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:16.554
and if I stand up
all of a sudden, I feel dizzy...

170
00:15:21.924 --> 00:15:23.602
It's gotten colder these days.

171
00:15:23.602 --> 00:15:26.702
You know you should pay more
attention to your blood pressure, right?

172
00:15:26.702 --> 00:15:27.904
Yes.

173
00:15:29.164 --> 00:15:33.864
If you miss taking your medicine again,
you'll pass out like last time.

174
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:45.356
Take this when you break out
in a cold sweat or feel dizzy, okay?

175
00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:47.803
Thank you.

176
00:16:00.135 --> 00:16:01.934
Nurse.

177
00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:05.755
- Yes?
- Is something the matter?

178
00:16:05.755 --> 00:16:08.453
Why? Does it seem that way?

179
00:16:08.456 --> 00:16:12.717
You've been really quiet,
and you haven't been smiling either.

180
00:16:12.717 --> 00:16:16.068
Smile. You look prettier that way.

181
00:16:16.068 --> 00:16:20.438
How can I smile all the time?
It's not like I made a mistake.

182
00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:25.480
You can drink water starting today.
Would you like some?

183
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.578
Yeah.

184
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.601
I can't give you a lot though.
Just think of it as a refreshment.

185
00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:39.150
It looks like you cried.

186
00:16:39.674 --> 00:16:42.073
Your eyes are swollen.

187
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.586
- Is it obvious?
- Really obvious.

188
00:16:54.908 --> 00:16:59.658
The truth is, I fought with my dad.

189
00:17:00.204 --> 00:17:01.704
Why?

190
00:17:02.448 --> 00:17:06.050
Because he only treats other people well.

191
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.350
To him, other people
always come before me.

192
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.425
Especially if they're his patients.

193
00:17:12.425 --> 00:17:15.725
- You're like that too though.
- I am?

194
00:17:15.725 --> 00:17:19.219
Do you treat your dad
the way you treat me?

195
00:17:19.813 --> 00:17:25.754
Well, I can't treat him
exactly the same, but...

196
00:17:26.775 --> 00:17:28.475
Then why all the fuss?

197
00:17:28.475 --> 00:17:30.642
Grandpa, you have no idea.

198
00:17:30.642 --> 00:17:33.642
About what happened to me yesterday.

199
00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:35.732
Why wouldn't I know?

200
00:17:35.732 --> 00:17:38.832
I'm sure you fought about
not understanding each other.

201
00:17:39.332 --> 00:17:41.448
How did you know that?

202
00:17:41.448 --> 00:17:45.217
What else would
family members have to fight about?

203
00:17:45.217 --> 00:17:47.612
You might not know it...

204
00:17:47.612 --> 00:17:50.214
but reality is worse than that.

205
00:17:52.622 --> 00:17:55.044
<i>You wench! I hate you!</i>

206
00:17:55.044 --> 00:18:01.398
<i>How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?</i>

207
00:18:04.997 --> 00:18:07.367
Don't fight with your dad.

208
00:18:08.931 --> 00:18:11.342
There are some people

209
00:18:11.342 --> 00:18:14.967
who can't even see
their daughter's face in person.

210
00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:17.660
Like me.

211
00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:39.505
- Are you taking your medicine?
- Yeah. Why?

212
00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:42.457
The medication should
either alleviate the symptoms

213
00:18:42.457 --> 00:18:45.034
or slow down its progression.

214
00:18:45.034 --> 00:18:47.540
But it's not working for you.

215
00:18:52.748 --> 00:18:55.436
Is your eyesight really bad?

216
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.438
It has gotten much worse than before.

217
00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.838
Does it get in the way of your surgeries?

218
00:19:03.857 --> 00:19:07.130
I told you to get yourself
checked up earlier.

219
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.928
What is this, when you're in your prime?

220
00:19:11.082 --> 00:19:14.052
I finally have an idea
of what it means to be a doctor...

221
00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:15.950
Do I have to quit now?

222
00:19:19.107 --> 00:19:21.857
<i>As of right now, it's just blurry vision</i>

223
00:19:21.857 --> 00:19:25.169
<i>but who knows
when the paralysis will come?</i>

224
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.998
Ji In.

225
00:19:38.698 --> 00:19:40.498
Are you still mad at me?

226
00:19:40.498 --> 00:19:43.286
It's not something I can get over easily.

227
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.698
Okay. I understand how I feel.

228
00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:52.248
But please don't stay mad for too long.

229
00:19:55.755 --> 00:19:58.050
Let me ask you one question.

230
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.887
Did you use your rights
as a foster parent

231
00:20:01.887 --> 00:20:04.405
to donate Doctor Kang's sister's organs?

232
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.717
Yeah.

233
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.050
I really can't understand you, Dad.

234
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.948
I mean, don't you know how
much that hurts the family?

235
00:20:16.948 --> 00:20:18.150
I know.

236
00:20:18.941 --> 00:20:22.652
But if I had to do it
all over again, I'd...

237
00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:24.409
make the same decision.

238
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:28.008
- Dad.
- That's how both sides can live.

239
00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:30.453
Both the donor and recipient.

240
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.560
<i>[Obituary Notice]</i>

241
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.748
"This is to notify you of Kang Dae Soo's
sudden and accidental death."

242
00:20:58.748 --> 00:21:01.949
"February 13th, 2018
at Palmunsan Funeral Hall."

243
00:21:01.949 --> 00:21:03.844
Palmunsan...

244
00:21:03.844 --> 00:21:05.531

"Son, Kang..."

246
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.948
<i>4713. It's time for your treatment.</i>

247
00:21:24.248 --> 00:21:25.448
Aren't you coming out?

248
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.600
Prisoner 4713 is here for his treatment.

249
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.300
<i>Okay, he may come in.</i>

250
00:22:11.382 --> 00:22:12.882
Have a seat.

251
00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:24.409
Let me take a look.

252
00:22:32.744 --> 00:22:35.744
Has the itchiness gotten better?

253
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.496
Thanks to you.

254
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.540
What about vomiting or nausea?

255
00:22:42.784 --> 00:22:45.812
It has gotten a lot better,
just like you said.

256
00:22:45.812 --> 00:22:47.573
The frequency has decreased too.

257
00:22:48.073 --> 00:22:49.323
That's good.

258
00:22:53.053 --> 00:22:54.553
But...

259
00:22:57.045 --> 00:22:59.486
everything else is fine...

260
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.350
but the swelling hasn't gone down.

261
00:23:26.879 --> 00:23:29.179
Bring my dad back!

262
00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:38.201
Bring my dad back!

263
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.198
Why didn't I realize it earlier?

264
00:23:48.533 --> 00:23:50.135
You haven't changed one bit!

265
00:23:54.842 --> 00:23:58.144
You grew up a lot.
Has it been 15 years now?

266
00:23:58.644 --> 00:24:01.500
I thought of this moment
every single day since then.

267
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.811
I got tricked, huh.

268
00:24:03.811 --> 00:24:06.634
I trusted you, not knowing
that you're my enemy.

269
00:24:06.634 --> 00:24:09.686
I bet you couldn't have
imagined that we'd meet like this.

270
00:24:09.686 --> 00:24:12.166
But what will you do now?

271
00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:13.916
You've been caught.

272
00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:19.164
I don't care. Your body is
so damaged, you could die tomorrow

273
00:24:19.164 --> 00:24:20.519
because of my prescriptions.

274
00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:22.872
You'll have no choice
but to come looking for me.

275
00:24:22.872 --> 00:24:27.452
You'll either beg me
to save you, or to kill you.

276
00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:32.514
Then I better tell everyone
that a doctor is here to kill a man.

277
00:24:34.665 --> 00:24:39.375
If I leave this place,
you'll die within a month.

278
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:42.773
Because I'm the only one
who knows how to treat your illness.

279
00:24:45.913 --> 00:24:48.121
There's something I know too.

280
00:24:48.122 --> 00:24:50.523
Something you don't know about your dad.

281
00:24:52.843 --> 00:24:56.444
Your dad came to tell me that he
needed money for his two kids.

282
00:24:56.444 --> 00:24:59.444
He said that he didn't even have
money for his daughter's surgery

283
00:24:59.444 --> 00:25:01.444
but that his son had asked for sneakers.

284
00:25:06.368 --> 00:25:09.208
But do you know what's funny?

285
00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:11.609
Your dad, who came to me
with his own two feet...

286
00:25:12.915 --> 00:25:15.196
begged at my feet.

287
00:25:15.196 --> 00:25:17.196
He asked me to save him.

288
00:25:18.564 --> 00:25:20.366
He even got on his knees.

289
00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:23.947
Isn't that hilarious?

290
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.198
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

291
00:25:28.674 --> 00:25:30.638
- Hey!
- <i>Hey!</i>

292
00:25:30.638 --> 00:25:32.240
What was that?

293
00:25:34.948 --> 00:25:36.250
What's going on?

294
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.850
Doctor Kang, calm down!

295
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.350
Save me. Save me, please!

296
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.148
- Save me, Doctor!
- Doctor, you mustn't do this.

297
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:47.032
Let go!

298
00:25:49.456 --> 00:25:53.858
That's what your dad said,
he begged the way I did just now.

299
00:25:53.858 --> 00:25:55.858
Doctor! Doctor!

300
00:25:56.433 --> 00:25:57.532
Doctor!

301
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.330
Doctor!

302
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.198
I wonder what pushed our
Doctor Kang to use violence.

303
00:26:31.698 --> 00:26:34.348
It's somewhat understandable...

304
00:26:34.348 --> 00:26:36.907
but you mustn't use violence.

305
00:26:36.907 --> 00:26:39.771
We have to hold back,
no matter how much they provoke us.

306
00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:41.872
I apologize.

307
00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:44.167
Things like this happen occasionally.

308
00:26:44.668 --> 00:26:47.734
After they start
the fight by using violence

309
00:26:47.734 --> 00:26:49.590
they report the prison officer.

310
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.637
It wouldn't just be
a problem for you then.

311
00:26:52.637 --> 00:26:54.645
It would affect us all.

312
00:26:54.645 --> 00:26:57.586
Including our chief, whose retirement
is just around the corner.

313
00:26:59.437 --> 00:27:00.947
I'll be more careful.

314
00:27:00.947 --> 00:27:04.500
I don't want to start a fire
in my latter years...

315
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.926
so please be careful.

316
00:27:07.562 --> 00:27:09.048
Yes, Sir.

317
00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:17.261
<i>Your dad came to tell me</i>

318
00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:19.040

He said that he didn't even have
money for his daughter's surgery

Oh, let me see that one.

Geez, it fits perfectly.

Wow.

333
00:28:36.645 --> 00:28:38.281
I can really donate my kidney

to my daughter

335

Oh, okay. I got it.

00:30:25.792 --> 00:30:28.962
and did this, this,
and tried to hit him like this.

I'm sure he had his reasons.

Do you think Doctor Kang
would've done that for no reason?

want to become a doctor?

You made that decision
on your own. To cure In Joo...

Not to get revenge for your father.

Is Baek Gyu Sang really leaving
without seeing his daughter?

451
00:39:48.299 --> 00:39:50.900
- It's regulation.
- Why?

452
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:55.100
The regulation is the same, whether
he's inside or outside the prison.

453
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.815
It's possible for someone
to visit the prisoner

454
00:39:57.815 --> 00:40:01.344
but the prisoner can't visit
anyone himself. That's the rule.

455
00:40:01.344 --> 00:40:04.054
But does that mean we should
make him leave, when she's so close?

456
00:40:04.054 --> 00:40:06.243
Why are you trying so hard?

457
00:40:06.243 --> 00:40:08.331
That prisoner has nothing to do with you.

458
00:40:08.331 --> 00:40:10.380
Because I know how he feels.

459
00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:16.380
I know how unbearable
it is to miss someone.

460
00:40:36.714 --> 00:40:38.926
- Let's go.
- Sure.

461
00:40:51.447 --> 00:40:53.147
Doctor Kang!

462

The front gate is this way.

be brought to the back door.

472
00:44:16.766 --> 00:44:19.167
Slow down, or you'll
get an upset stomach.

Doctor Kang, you're a good doctor.

476
00:45:23.335 --> 00:45:26.335
What, what is it?
What's wrong with this bastard?

477
00:45:29.397 --> 00:45:31.429
My stomach hurts.

478
00:45:33.799 --> 00:45:37.199
Hey, here. Eat another one.

479
00:45:57.647 --> 00:45:59.118
Oh geez.

480
00:46:24.738 --> 00:46:26.938
Where are the prison guards?

481
00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:30.400
Prison Guard! Prison Guard!

482
00:46:39.642 --> 00:46:42.171
What's going on? What happened?

483
00:46:42.171 --> 00:46:45.072
Hey, 4817! 4817!

484
00:47:00.755 --> 00:47:02.255
This is an emergency!

485
00:47:06.418 --> 00:47:08.706
Stop right there.
I'll take a look at him.

486
00:47:10.602 --> 00:47:12.655
What's going on? What happened?

487
00:47:12.655 --> 00:47:14.749
They said that he
suddenly collapsed on the field.

488
00:47:16.706 --> 00:47:18.506
- Let's wheel him inside.
- Okay.

489
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.700
- What's going on?
- I don't know either.

490
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.470
Get your hands off of him!

491
00:48:21.363 --> 00:48:22.963
I'll do it.

492
00:48:23.463 --> 00:48:24.564
Move!

493
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.291
Chief, you're too worked up
to make a proper diagnosis!

494
00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:37.691
Let go of me!

495
00:48:43.057 --> 00:48:44.508
Chief.

496
00:48:45.769 --> 00:48:47.968
Chief, calm down!

497
00:48:50.001 --> 00:48:53.755
Chief! His pulse is weak.

498
00:48:58.146 --> 00:49:01.546
Chief! I'll do it!

499
00:49:02.052 --> 00:49:03.653
Please wait outside.

500
00:49:04.153 --> 00:49:05.639
But I...

501
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.900
- Please check his blood sugar.
- Sure.

502
00:49:36.222 --> 00:49:38.372
His blood sugar level is way too high.

503
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:41.702
His glucose is at 500.

504
00:49:44.827 --> 00:49:48.099
Please inject him with 1 liter
of normal saline and 10 units of insulin.

505
00:49:48.099 --> 00:49:49.099
Sure.

506
00:50:05.885 --> 00:50:07.675
Wh... what are you doing?

507
00:50:09.921 --> 00:50:11.021
What's wrong?

508
00:50:12.184 --> 00:50:13.784
<i>It smells like fruit.</i>

509
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:18.115
I think it's DKA.
(Diabetic ketoacidosis, can be fatal.)

510
00:50:20.767 --> 00:50:23.068
He... hey, call the ambulance...

511
00:50:23.068 --> 00:50:25.697
- They're on standby.
- Transfer him right away!

512
00:50:25.697 --> 00:50:27.697
- Hurry!
- Yes, Sir.

513
00:50:59.014 --> 00:51:01.914
Hang in there for just
a bit longer, Sung Ho.

514
00:51:01.914 --> 00:51:03.113
Just a bit longer.

515
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.238
<i>Are you sure you didn't do anything?</i>

516
00:51:08.238 --> 00:51:11.099
Geez, I'm about to lose my mind here.

517
00:51:11.099 --> 00:51:13.282
Look at me. I don't
have anything with me.

518
00:51:13.282 --> 00:51:15.813
And that fat bastard,
4817 didn't have any injuries.

519
00:51:15.813 --> 00:51:18.785
Look. I'm the one
who's about to die here.

520
00:51:18.785 --> 00:51:21.485
Then why did a guy
collapse all of a sudden?

521
00:51:21.485 --> 00:51:24.793
How would I know that? He started
choking all of a sudden, and then...

522
00:51:24.793 --> 00:51:27.517
Doesn't he have high
blood pressure? Let him die!

523
00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:29.253
Geez, seriously.

524
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.499
Break's over!

525
00:51:32.499 --> 00:51:33.599
Go inside for now.

526
00:51:34.099 --> 00:51:35.776
I'm sure we'll find out once they return.

527
00:51:35.776 --> 00:51:38.264
Geez, seriously.

528
00:51:44.787 --> 00:51:48.689
- Can I go to the infirmary?
- Why?

529
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:51.220
I might die before that bastard does.

530
00:51:52.733 --> 00:51:56.017
The infirmary is empty right now.

531
00:51:56.017 --> 00:51:57.293
Go.

532
00:51:58.186 --> 00:51:59.586
Damn it.

533
00:52:06.747 --> 00:52:08.646
Call a doctor of internal medicine!

534
00:52:12.945 --> 00:52:16.155
He's 21 years old with a blood pressure
of 80/60 and a heart rate of 140.

535
00:52:16.155 --> 00:52:18.878
He has a history of Type 1 Diabetes,
with a high blood sugar level.

536
00:52:18.878 --> 00:52:21.807
Considering how his mouth smells
like fruit, he's suspected to have DKA.

537
00:52:21.807 --> 00:52:24.271
If he has Type 1 Diabetes,
it's probably DKA.

538
00:52:24.271 --> 00:52:26.032
But why did the DKA
occur all of a sudden?

539
00:52:26.032 --> 00:52:27.331
I don't know.

540
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:31.106
Did he have a fever or an infection?

541
00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:34.099
- No.
- Or did he stop taking his medicine...

542
00:52:34.099 --> 00:52:35.499
No.

543
00:52:35.499 --> 00:52:37.720
Do you know what medications he takes?

544
00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.320
Are you an internal medicine doctor?

545
00:52:40.555 --> 00:52:43.889
- I'm not.
- Call one over, right now!

546
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.555
Please call N.S. as well.

547
00:52:47.555 --> 00:52:49.365
Why do we need to call neurosurgery?

548
00:52:49.914 --> 00:52:52.514
His brain could have
been damaged when he fell.

549
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.617
What are you talking about?
Don't you see his vitals?

550
00:52:55.617 --> 00:52:58.740
We don't have time.
We have to treat his DKA first!

551
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.400
I told you to call a doctor
of internal medicine!

552
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.099
We still need to take
a CT scan of his brain!

553
00:53:02.099 --> 00:53:03.905
I'm his guardian.

554
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.430
I know him best!

555
00:53:17.356 --> 00:53:18.956
How is he?

556
00:53:19.472 --> 00:53:22.325
He has DKA, just as you predicted.

557
00:53:22.325 --> 00:53:27.456
Since we started him on acidosis,
he'll get better soon enough.

558
00:53:57.735 --> 00:54:00.836
Lord, please save him...

559
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.450
<i>Prison Guard! Prison Guard!</i>

560
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:13.950
Hey! Hey!

561
00:54:17.599 --> 00:54:20.099
4713! 4713!

562
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.900
Where are you?

563
00:54:29.642 --> 00:54:32.441
What the heck? What's wrong with him?

564
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:40.642
What's wrong with him?

565
00:54:40.642 --> 00:54:44.918
What do we do? Our doctors
are out, and so is our ambulance car.

566
00:54:44.918 --> 00:54:46.981
- Did you call 911?
- Yes.

567
00:54:51.865 --> 00:54:53.340
I...

568
00:54:54.499 --> 00:54:56.526
- We need to move him to a big hospital.
- Okay.

569
00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:59.195
Please bring him a blanket so we
can maintain his temperature.

570
00:54:59.197 --> 00:55:01.197
- Okay.
- Please bring the stretcher.

571
00:55:35.238 --> 00:55:36.537
Excuse me.

572
00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.300
Yes?

573
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.800
Are you sure he's
getting the right treatment?

574
00:55:42.601 --> 00:55:44.110
What was the order?

575
00:55:49.197 --> 00:55:51.756
He's getting 1 liter
of normal saline per hour

576
00:55:51.756 --> 00:55:54.999
and a mixture of 100 cc of normal
saline and 100 units of insulin

577
00:55:54.999 --> 00:55:56.999
in 10 cc increments per hour.

578
00:55:56.999 --> 00:56:00.251
His blood sugar's checked every hour, his
electrolytes are checked every four hours

579
00:56:00.251 --> 00:56:03.099
and the goal is to get his
blood sugar down to 150/250.

580
00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:04.907
He's currently on acidosis treatment.

581
00:56:04.907 --> 00:56:08.907
Then why do his vitals keep
getting worse? He's not waking up either.

582
00:56:19.117 --> 00:56:20.559
Why do we need to call neurosurgery?

583
00:56:20.559 --> 00:56:23.099
His brain could have
been damaged when he fell.

584
00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:27.110
What are you saying? Don't you
see his vitals? We don't have time.

585
00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:30.099
- We need to treat his DKA first!
- We should still take a brain CT!

586
00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:32.099
I'm his guardian.

587
00:56:32.599 --> 00:56:34.599
I know him best!

588
00:56:51.532 --> 00:56:54.675
Neurosurgery.
Hurry and call neurosurgery!

589
00:56:54.675 --> 00:56:57.800
- Take a non-enhanced CT! Hurry!
- Sure, I'll do that.

590
00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.401
Nurse Nam! Bring the ambu bag!

591
00:57:05.557 --> 00:57:07.157
Let's move him!

592
00:57:23.146 --> 00:57:25.146
Move! This is an emergency!
