00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.119
On today's live show, I'm introducing...

2
00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.150
the nation's favorite pair of jeans.

3
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.520
It is a set of three hip-up, stretch skinny jeans.

4
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.429
Look at the design. The design is stylish, isn't it?

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.100
Let's look at the backside.

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.830
(Hip-up skinny jeans)

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.959
What do you think?

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.200
Doesn't his bottom look like it's about to soar into the sky?

9
00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.399
It's the power of the cutting-edge technology used in these jeans.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270
The high elasticity...

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.380
- Gosh, it hurts. - of the material...

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.509
enables you to exercise in these jeans without discomfort.

13
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.950
You don't believe it?

14
00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.149
Let's see a demonstration.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.289
Look at this.

16
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.259
There's no sign of discomfort while they stretch vigorously.

17
00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:53.990
You still can't believe it?

18
00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.060
1, 2, 3.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.259
My goodness.

20
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.469
- Well... - Darn it.

21
00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.110
The product we have prepared today...

22
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.979
comes in the colors...

23
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.410
blue, black, and sky blue.

24
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.419
(Good Work, Today)

25
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.449
Please let me pass the screening at least at one place.

26
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.750
I'll visit the church and the temple more often.

27
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.630
Save us, merciful Buddha. Amen.

28
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.160
- Seo Jin, what are you doing? - I'm praying.

29
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.330
I just submitted job applications...

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.770
to 25 companies.

31
00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.440
Good luck.

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.339
Oh, it's him. He's such an amazing actor.

33
00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:43.910
What was his name? Lee...

34
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.479
Who? Do you mean Deok Hwa?

35
00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.979
Deok Hwa? Do you know him?

36
00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.550
He's Jun Ki's dad.

37
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.919
- What? He's Jun Ki's dad? - Yes.

38
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.990
What a surprise.

39
00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:56.690
I should ask Jun Ki for his dad's autograph.

40
00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.259
Don't. He doesn't like it when people talk about his dad.

41
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.630
- Why? - The thing is,

42
00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.559
- he... - Okay.

43
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.430
What? What is it?

44
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.569
Is it just me?

45
00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.840
Were you badmouthing me again?

46
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.239
What were you saying, Wolfman?

47
00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.380
I wasn't badmouthing you.

48
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.410
- Tell me what you were saying. - Guys.

49
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.410
I have amazing news.

50
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.079
What's the fuss?

51
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.720
- You're a star now. Look at this. - What?

52
00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.250
- What is it? - "Who is the guy?"

53
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.419
Who are you?

54
00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.090
What's that?

55
00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:35.530
- Jun Ki... - What is all this?

56
00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:36.989
My goodness.

57
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.000
- What is that? - What's going on?

58
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630
What is all that?

59
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.000
The Internet is flooded with pictures of you.

60
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.900
You even have a nickname. Guess what it is.

61
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.609
Pink Boy.

62
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.269
What?

63
00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.210
- Look at that. - Stop laughing.

64
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.449
Why would they put so much effort into those pictures?

65
00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:58.579
Hello.

66
00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.590
Yes. Okay.

67
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.350
That's right.

68
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.090
- Sorry? - Pink Boy.

69
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.729
I see. Bye.

70
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.630
What was it about?

71
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.669
A film company wants to cast me.

72
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.930
They said I was impressive.

73
00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.600
You? Where did they see you?

74
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.139
- On the home shopping channel. - The home shopping channel?

75
00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.109
Are they talking about Pink Boy?

76
00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.410
- That's absurd. - Stop saying that word.

77
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.650
Here are the scenario and the shooting schedule.

78
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.049
You want to cast me without an audition?

79
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.090
Do you think this is a fraud?

80
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.060
No. That's not what I meant.

81
00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.859
Which role will I be playing?

82
00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.630
It's a movie about a mother...

83
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.600
who gets back at her daughter's kidnapper.

84
00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.269
You'll play an accomplice of the kidnapper.

85
00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.840
Will I have lines too?

86
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.169
Yes, although it's not a lot.

87
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.169
You have scenes with the main character.

88
00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.539
Who will play the main character?

89
00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.710
The main character?

90
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.479
Kim Hee Ja.

91
00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.609
Kim Hee Ja?

92
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.449
From "The Desert"?

93
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.019
The nation's greatest actress?

94
00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.419
Yes.

95
00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.120
You should practice a lot, okay?

96
00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.160
Okay. I'll work hard.

97
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:15.930
Thank you.

98
00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.729
What do you think? Does it taste good?

99
00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:26.200
Yes, it does.

100
00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.669
By the way, are you going to cook something anytime soon?

101
00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.010
We've been eating muffins for days. I think I'm getting tired...

102
00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.580
Just eat it.

103
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.210
What if she goes back to rapping?

104
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.919
Fine, I'll eat it.

105
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.989
There's a lot. Eat slowly.

106
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.460
Guys!

107
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.989
I have amazing news.

108
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.789
I've been cast in a movie.

109
00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:51.660
Do you know who I'll be playing opposite?

110
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.030
The nation's greatest actress,

111
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.429
Kim Hee Ja. Can you believe that?

112
00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.770
- Kim Hee Ja? - Kim Hee Ja? Really?

113
00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.299
- What's your role? - I'll be murdered by her.

114
00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.539
I knew it. It's a minor role again, right?

115
00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.979
But I have lines this time.

116
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.739
Anyway, that's great.

117
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.510
Shouldn't we have a party?

118
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.249
With spicy stew and rice...

119
00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.320
I'm sorry, but I have to go through the scenario.

120
00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.520
Let's celebrate some other time.

121
00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.489
- Kim Hee Ja! - I want food.

122
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.359
He's so excited.

123
00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.960
Du Shik, you dropped your muffin. Eat a new one.

124
00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:23.090
Thank you.

125
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.669
Hello.

126
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.470
Gosh, I died because of you.

127
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.080
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.379
- Did you practice a lot? - I haven't slept in a week.

129
00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.280
Where is Ms. Kim?

130
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.419
She'll be here soon.

131
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:48.150
There she is.

132
00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:56.929
It's Kim Hee Ja.

133
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.330
Hello, Ms. Kim.

134
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.070
What's with her?

135
00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.340
She's immersed in her role.

136
00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.780
In the movie, her daughter has been kidnapped.

137
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.210
So she's not eating...

138
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.410
or sleeping. She doesn't even go home.

139
00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.650
She doesn't want to disturb her emotions.

140
00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.650
She's incredible.

141
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.220
You... I'll suffocate you.

142
00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.460
I can see why she is the nation's greatest actress.

143
00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:34.070
In this scene, the mother visits the kidnapper's accomplice.

144
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.499
Her anger explodes as she finally confronts the culprit.

145
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.770
The accomplice is frightened.

146
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.539
While the angry mother wrestles with the accomplice,

147
00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.140
she loses control and ends up killing him.

148
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.309
Do you understand?

149
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:48.080
Let's rehearse.

150
00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:49.309
Okay.

151
00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:00.359
Rehearsal, cue.

152
00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:04.059
Who is it?

153
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.330
Who is it?

154
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.600
Who...

155
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.169
How did you...

156
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.280
Where is my daughter? Where's Su Jin?

157
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.549
Tell me, you punk.

158
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.720
- We're rehearsing. - What? We're rehearsing?

159
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.590
Tell me! Where is my daughter, Su Jin?

160
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.189
Tell me!

161
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:33.489
Please stop.

162
00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:35.989
Where is my daughter?

163
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.200
Hee Ja, stop.

164
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.030
Jun Ki, are you okay? Wake up.

165
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.429
Wake up!

166
00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:48.609
Are you okay?

167
00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:54.010
I saw a white tunnel and dark shadows.

168
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.879
Gosh, that was close.

169
00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.020
I'm sorry. I was too immersed.

170
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.720
Are you okay?

171
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.160
I'm okay.

172
00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:10.999
Director, let me calm down a little.

173
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.299
This is exhausting.

174
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.970
Gosh, she doesn't know where to stop.

175
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.070
What if the new guy becomes hospitalized too?

176
00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:24.840
- Hospitalized? - The guy before you is in hospital.

177
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.080
He got beaten up by Hee Ja.

178
00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:28.080
- His recovery will take four weeks. - What?

179
00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:30.619
So be careful when she beats you.

180
00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:31.720
Okay?

181
00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:35.989
Okay.

182
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.489
Are you ready, Jun Ki?

183
00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.399
Yes, I am.

184
00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:47.499
Ready, action.

185
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.369
Wait. How did you find me?

186
00:08:57.979 --> 00:08:59.210
Where is my daughter?

187
00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:02.479
Where is she? Tell me!

188
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.779
Blood?

189
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.720
That's metal.

190
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:11.320
- Gosh. - Where is she?

191
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.859
Stop. Stop!

192
00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:20.830
Wait.

193
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.100
- No! - Stop!

194
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.840
You filmed this?

195
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.210
Yes.

196
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.050
Oh, that's so pretty.

197
00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:40.379
Look at the baby.

198
00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:41.649
He's so cute.

199
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.350
Cute, my foot.

200
00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:46.759
After I started on this job, I came to believe...

201
00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.659
all humans are born evil.

202
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.129
Gosh, how can you say that about a baby?

203
00:09:51.129 --> 00:09:53.499
You obviously haven't seen a baby throwing a tantrum.

204
00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:56.930
The parents ask me to make the baby laugh.

205
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.769
I'm not a comedian or anything. How could I do that?

206
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.739
It's not that hard.

207
00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:03.979
Are you saying it's easy?

208
00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:05.639
It is. Do you want to see?

209
00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:07.279
Come here, my girl.

210
00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.979
Peekaboo!

211
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.290
Peekaboo!

212
00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:17.619
Wait.

213
00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:19.090
You made her laugh.

214
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.759
What did you just say?

215
00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:24.499
- "Peeka..." What was that? - I said, "peekaboo".

216
00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:27.060
"Peekapoo"?

217
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.869
- It's "boo". - It's not "poo". It's "boo".

218
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.700
- Like... "foo"? - That's not it.

219
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.239
Do, re, mi, fa, sol

220
00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:36.909
In that key, say "boo".

221
00:10:36.909 --> 00:10:39.239
Oh, so it's "boo", right?

222
00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.109
Is there anything else?

223
00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:42.180
Something else?

224
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.050
Can you hold Sol for a second?

225
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.389
- Come here, Sol. - Here you are.

226
00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:50.290
Oh, Mommy's gone!

227
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.790
Where's Mommy?

228
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:54.460
Here she is!

229
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.100
That... That's fantastic.

230
00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960
That's fantastic!

231
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.100
"Mommy's gone. Here she is!"

232
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.170
You need to use higher pitch though.

233
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.139
- Use the pitch of ti. - Ti!

234
00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:09.509
- Here she is! - Here she is!

235
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:10.609
That's right!

236
00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:13.409
Here she is! In the key of ti!

237
00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:17.009
- I'm home. - Hi.

238
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.479
What happened to you?

239
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:19.649
I got hurt a bit...

240
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:22.989
while filming.

241
00:11:22.989 --> 00:11:25.659
What did you film that got you hurt so badly?

242
00:11:25.859 --> 00:11:27.259
Kim Hee Ja was...

243
00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:29.489
really into her role at that moment.

244
00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:31.060
That doesn't make any sense though.

245
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.560
How could she beat someone this much?

246
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.170
She could even kill someone if she concentrates so much once more.

247
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.940
I'm okay. It just happened while acting.

248
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.670
I'm okay. I'm...

249
00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:45.810
Jun Ki. Jun Ki!

250
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.149
Did he just fall asleep?

251
00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:51.649
- Is he breathing? - Goodness.

252
00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:54.889
What a great life that is!

253
00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.690
Two pale white eyeballs with dark shadows...

254
00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:06.399
Is he talking in his sleep?

255
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.600
- What is he doing? - Are you okay?

256
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.800
Why are you doing that? I'm so sorry!

257
00:12:17.739 --> 00:12:20.479
We'll shoot the next scene of the yesterday's one.

258
00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:22.249
After killing the accomplice,

259
00:12:22.249 --> 00:12:24.850
the mom cries like an insane person.

260
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.119
Jun Ki, you shouldn't move at all.

261
00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:28.720
- Do you understand? - Yes, I do.

262
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.220
Let's do this!

263
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.310
Ready, action!

264
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:55.850
Where's my daughter?

265
00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:59.119
Where's my Su Jin?

266
00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:02.590
Where's my daughter, Su Jin?

267
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.690
- Say it! - Please...

268
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.560
- Say it! - Please help...

269
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.590
- Where is she? - I...

270
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.470
Where's my daughter?

271
00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.509
You...

272
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.210
Where is she? Say it!

273
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.479
Where is she?

274
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.729
Cut! That's what I want!

275
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.659
- Goodness. - Amazing.

276
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.200
Hee Ja, that was amazing.

277
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.639
I got goosebumps just watching at you.

278
00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.710
Jun Ki, you did well too.

279
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.810
I was afraid you'd move, but you didn't at all.

280
00:13:58.810 --> 00:13:59.879
Thank you.

281
00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:03.310
I'm sorry, but can I go to the bathroom right now?

282
00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:07.489
What do you think about him? Isn't he better than your expectation?

283
00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:08.690
He really is.

284
00:14:08.989 --> 00:14:11.389
He's good at acting.

285
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:13.320
And his attitude is quite serious.

286
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.060
Where did you find someone like him?

287
00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:19.029
Well...

288
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.629
I found him...

289
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.580
That could have killed me!

290
00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:38.279
How could that get into my mouth?

291
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:45.119
But he said I did well!

292
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.960
The world is finally recognizing me.

293
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.729
- Hello. - Hi.

294
00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.229
- Thank you. - Thanks.

295
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.670
Why is he like this today?

296
00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:02.710
He hasn't been in a good mood since this morning.

297
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.739
Before we start the ceremony, I'll take some pictures of Jang Gun.

298
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:09.609
But Jang Gun is in such a bad mood. What should we do?

299
00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:10.979
I'm sorry, but...

300
00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:12.080
Do you want me to make him laugh?

301
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.680
How did you know that?

302
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.350
That's the face everyone makes when they want me to do that.

303
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.460
I'll try it.

304
00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:21.129
Here I go.

305
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.229
Do, re, mi, fa, sol

306
00:15:25.229 --> 00:15:27.229
Peekaboo, boo, boo

307
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.600
Peekaboo!

308
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.499
Peekaboo!

309
00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.670
What are you doing? He's crying even more.

310
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.440
Don't worry. I have one more thing I can try.

311
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.680
Jang Gun!

312
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.350
Uncle's gone! Where is he?

313
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.050
Here he is!

314
00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:46.649
What are you doing?

315
00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:48.119
He's having a fit of terror.

316
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.550
Jang Gun, it's okay. It's really okay.

317
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.320
It's weird. It worked so well when Yoon Ah did the same.

318
00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:54.930
What should I do?

319
00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:57.700
Peekaboo!

320
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.330
Peekaboo!

321
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.369
Where's Auntie? Where is she?

322
00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.769
Here she is!

323
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.310
There you go!

324
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.369
What did you do? He's not that difficult.

325
00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.909
Is this the reason why you made me come all the way from home?

326
00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:14.009
How strange.

327
00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:16.310
He was crying a lot when I tried the same thing.

328
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.749
You are really good with babies.

329
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:20.249
Now I'm relieved.

330
00:16:21.489 --> 00:16:22.519
Ouch, my stomach...

331
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.019
Is it hurting again?

332
00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:25.690
That's it. We should go to the doctor's.

333
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.119
What about Jang Gun?

334
00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.090
Your mom's almost here too.

335
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.529
I'll take care of him. Don't worry and go.

336
00:16:32.129 --> 00:16:33.460
Could you do that for us?

337
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.769
I'm really sorry, but could you change his clothes too?

338
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:39.100
I will. Don't worry about here.

339
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.369
I'll be here with him.

340
00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:41.670
Thank you so much.

341
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.239
See you soon.

342
00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.080
He's a weird boy.

343
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.779
What did I do so differently?

344
00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:50.649
Babies naturally know...

345
00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:52.279
who's evil or not.

346
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:54.850
Does that mean I'm evil?

347
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.519
- That's now what I exactly meant. - Right.

348
00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:58.420
I'll go to the bathroom. Just keep an eye on the baby.

349
00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:06.030
This is so pretty.

350
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.600
I wonder how much this costs.

351
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.139
Oh, I have to change his clothes.

352
00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:14.109
Alright.

353
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.780
This is so adorable!

354
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.510
This will look good on Sol too!

355
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.510
Don't you think so, Sol? Look at this.

356
00:17:28.219 --> 00:17:29.719
- You did a great job. - Thank you.

357
00:17:29.719 --> 00:17:32.119
You loved it, so what can I say more about that?

358
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.290
Thank you so much, sir.

359
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.159
You did a great job.

360
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.260
It was such a successful day!

361
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.600
Why don't we have samgyeopsal and soju?

362
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.199
- Why not? - I love that idea!

363
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.969
You can go with us.

364
00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:47.609
Are you going too, Hee Ja?

365
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.340
Why are you being like that?

366
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:54.280
I'm pretty tired. I think I should go home now.

367
00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:56.679
Hey,

368
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.949
Bye.

369
00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.250
What was that? Did I do anything wrong?

370
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.350
Nothing. Don't worry about that.

371
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.719
Hee Ja! Hee Ja!

372
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.959
Hee Ja!

373
00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:11.859
How can you just go like that?

374
00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:14.070
I just don't feel like eating with everyone.

375
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.300
Is it because of what I told you earlier?

376
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.469
I hate...

377
00:18:16.469 --> 00:18:19.340
someone like him, who's confidence only because of his background.

378
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.939
You know it well too, Hee Ja.

379
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.340
Deok Hwa really helped me a lot when I had hard times.

380
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.709
He asked me to work with his son. How can I say no to that?

381
00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:28.050
What does that mean?

382
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.050
Jun Ki, this is not what you think.

383
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.520
What are you talking about right now?

384
00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:42.590
Look at here, Sol.

385
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.000
Look how pretty you are!

386
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.199
Look at here! That's right.

387
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.300
Look!

388
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.169
- What are you doing, Yoon Ah? - Oh, my goodness!

389
00:18:50.469 --> 00:18:51.770
Why are you so surprised?

390
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.369
Why are you taking pictures of someone else's baby?

391
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.469
I thought he was Sol from the distance.

392
00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.909
Where is Sol?

393
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:02.280
What's going on, Yoon Ah?

394
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.810
It is...

395
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.649
What if my clients see?

396
00:19:05.649 --> 00:19:06.780
I'm sorry, I was actually...

397
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.949
I don't care anymore. Just change her clothes. Now!

398
00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:11.320
- Goodness. - Jang Gun!

399
00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:15.290
There you are!

400
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.060
My little Jang Gun.

401
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.929
It's been a while.

402
00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:26.300
It's the second time seeing you since you were born.

403
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.669
It's all because Grandma's living in America.

404
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:30.409
He's so handsome.

405
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.439
- I know. - He is really calm.

406
00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:35.149
Why did he get so skinny by the way?

407
00:19:35.379 --> 00:19:37.879
His cheeks looked bigger in the pictures.

408
00:19:37.879 --> 00:19:39.379
It's all gone now.

409
00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:41.149
I don't think so.

410
00:19:43.389 --> 00:19:45.090
By the way, who are you?

411
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.359
We are here to take pictures for the 100th-day ceremony.

412
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.590
Aren't you tired, Grandma?

413
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.659
We'll hold him from now.

414
00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:52.959
Leave it up to me. It's fine.

415
00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:56.830
You have no idea how long it's been since I held Jang Gun.

416
00:19:57.399 --> 00:20:00.939
He is the eighth-generation only son...

417
00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:03.240
of Yumangong clan of the Lees of Gyeongju.

418
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.980
His parents went through a lot...

419
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.879
like in vitro fertilization...

420
00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:10.780
in order to have him.

421
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.719
We have to interview you, ma'am.

422
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.990
You should say something to your grandson.

423
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.050
- Let us take Jang Gun. - I'll hold him.

424
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.760
I see. You can interview me while I'm holding him like this.

425
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.159
I want to hold him.

426
00:20:19.159 --> 00:20:21.230
That's a better picture, isn't it?

427
00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:24.929
You shouldn't. This is insane.

428
00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:31.570
Jang Gun, did you poop?

429
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.040
Wait a little.

430
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.510
I'll change your diaper.

431
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.810
No, ma'am. Let us do it.

432
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.949
- Baby poop smells terrible. - I'll do it.

433
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.310
No, I'll change his diaper.

434
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.320
My grandson, shall I take a look at you?

435
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:50.320
You want to take a look?

436
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.590
Let's see, Jang Gun.

437
00:20:53.689 --> 00:20:55.830
Let me take a look.

438
00:20:55.929 --> 00:20:57.659
Let's see.

439
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:04.699
What are you doing?

440
00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:07.639
I know he's only a baby, but you should respect his privacy.

441
00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:09.869
Privacy, my foot.

442
00:21:13.949 --> 00:21:15.250
What's wrong with you?

443
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.520
Ma'am. Jang Gun is young, but please respect him.

444
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.750
You're violating his right.

445
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.949
"Violating his right"?

446
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.090
Goodness.

447
00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:29.060
What on earth?

448
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.629
Are you trying to be funny?

449
00:21:31.629 --> 00:21:33.459
I had a traumatic experience.

450
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:36.770
When I was young, my grandmother said, "I'll take it off of you."

451
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.439
Ever since then, I can't eat anything that looks like it.

452
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.570
That's nonsense.

453
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.939
- You can't, ma'am. - How dare you?

454
00:21:46.209 --> 00:21:48.350
Take your hands off him now.

455
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.820
Let go of him.

456
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.679
- No way. - Take your hands off.

457
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.490
You punk.

458
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.119
- Goodness. - How dare you?

459
00:21:58.419 --> 00:21:59.820
Don't do it, ma'am.

460
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.060
You should have let him go when I said so.

461
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.760
- Don't do it, ma'am. - Let me see.

462
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.230
Let's take a look...

463
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:24.280
Gosh.

464
00:22:25.649 --> 00:22:27.080
What's this?

465
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.149
Our Jang Gun...

466
00:22:29.419 --> 00:22:33.159
Where is his...

467
00:22:33.459 --> 00:22:36.490
- Ma'am. - No, ma'am.

468
00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:38.800
What should we do?

469
00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:53.109
What brings you here without calling me?

470
00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:54.750
Why did you do it?

471
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.209
Why did you do it again?

472
00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.350
What are you talking about?

473
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.050
I heard everything from Director Kim.

474
00:23:02.689 --> 00:23:04.790
I asked you not to do that anymore.

475
00:23:05.389 --> 00:23:07.290
I'm doing fine on my own.

476
00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:09.389
Why do you keep doing it?

477
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:12.659
If so, you should do better on your own.

478
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.469
I was not at all impressed to see you on a shopping channel.

479
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.240
Gosh, that was embarrassing.

480
00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.810
I asked him a favor.

481
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.350
I felt bad to see my only child having a hard time.

482
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:30.080
What's wrong with that?

483
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.520
I can't be proud of myself.

484
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.719
- Why? - It's because I'm your son.

485
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.790
It's because I'm the son of the actor, Lee Deok Hwa,

486
00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.389
whom I respect the most.

487
00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:43.260
That's why I want to be successful...

488
00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:45.959
without your help and be proud.

489
00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:50.770
Then I can be proud in front of you.

490
00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:56.409
Father, please trust me and let me do it on my own.

491
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.540
That's the only thing that I ask of you.

492
00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:02.449
I understand what you mean...

493
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.480
Fine, be on home shopping channels,

494
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.219
or keep playing minor roles forever.

495
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.649
Do whatever you want.

496
00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:11.560
Goodness.

497
00:24:11.859 --> 00:24:16.429
By the way, why do you wear pink underwear?

498
00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:17.859
You're a man.

499
00:24:17.859 --> 00:24:20.300
- It's sexy. - Goodness.

500
00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:24.169
Okay, let's go inside.

501
00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:26.600
Why don't we eat together?

502
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.109
I can't. I have some work to do. Goodbye.

503
00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:34.750
Jun Ki.

504
00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:42.090
Gosh, I raised a good son.

505
00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:52.230
I apologize for what happened.

506
00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:54.100
You didn't know.

507
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.199
Whether I knew it or not, it was all my fault.

508
00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.669
I'm sorry.

509
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.669
Thank you for dinner.

510
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.469
See you later, sir.

511
00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:06.639
Jun Ki.

512
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.550
Goodness, what a guy.

513
00:25:12.619 --> 00:25:14.850
Hey, how's the grandmother?

514
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.919
Really? I'm relieved to hear that.

515
00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:21.959
I'm sorry about what happened. I'll take responsibility.

516
00:25:23.129 --> 00:25:24.300
I'm really sorry.

517
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.629
Bye.

518
00:25:27.429 --> 00:25:29.530
What happened? Is everything solved?

519
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.639
Yes, I think so.

520
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.899
What were you thinking?

521
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.510
- I'm sorry. - What's the use?

522
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.810
You can't do that at someone else's birthday party.

523
00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:41.109
I did it because I was sorry.

524
00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:44.179
I felt bad for Sol.

525
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.490
Sol is unlucky to have me as her mom.

526
00:25:55.129 --> 00:25:57.560
I couldn't celebrate her birthday.

527
00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:00.600
I never bought her...

528
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.730
pretty clothes or toys.

529
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:08.869
I just wanted to make her a birthday photo.

530
00:26:11.639 --> 00:26:12.879
I'm very sorry.

531
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:24.020
Our today's item is...

532
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.359
a smile calibrator that improves your smile.

533
00:26:27.459 --> 00:26:32.000
Three minutes of your day will guarantee a natural smile.

534
00:26:32.129 --> 00:26:33.800
What do you think after using it?

535
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:37.800
It's easier for me to smile.

536
00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:40.139
Is it easier to smile?

537
00:26:40.139 --> 00:26:43.939
Could you tell us in detail how it is easier to smile?

538
00:26:46.179 --> 00:26:47.909
- In detail? - Yes.

539
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:49.050
In detail.

540
00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:52.649
I mean...

541
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.790
the corners of my mouth used to sag.

542
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.060
However, this makes my lips go up.

543
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.060
My smile became more natural.

544
00:27:08.129 --> 00:27:10.000
Gosh, what's this?

545
00:27:10.699 --> 00:27:13.000
Why did she make me talk when it's already difficult?

546
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.139
My jaw hurts.

547
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.209
What if people take photos and spread them on the Internet?

548
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.050
Darn it.

549
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.520
Who is it now?

550
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.159
Hello?

551
00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:33.919
This is Lee Jun Ki.

552
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.629
What?

553
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:38.830
A meeting?

554
00:27:42.854 --> 00:27:47.854

555
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.409
- Excuse me. - Leave it here.

556
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:55.550
Okay.

557
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.820
I just got a call. I'm Lee Jun Ki.

558
00:28:02.649 --> 00:28:04.459
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

559
00:28:04.459 --> 00:28:05.590
Hello.

560
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.560
Why did you call me?

561
00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.359
I'm starting a morning drama soon.

562
00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:13.100
Someone recommended you.

563
00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:14.300
Someone recommended me?

564
00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:18.070
Who?

565
00:28:18.369 --> 00:28:19.740
Who recommended me?

566
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.109
- It was me. - She's here.

567
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.240
Hello, Ms. Kim.

568
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.409
It's nice to meet you.

569
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.149
Hello.

570
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.119
Why did you recommend me?

571
00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:34.320
Director Choi was looking for a new and talented actor who's handsome.

572
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.149
You may not be handsome, but you're good at acting.

573
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.560
That's why I recommended you.

574
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.060
- Are you not happy? - I am.

575
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.290
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

576
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.730
It's up to you to get casted.

577
00:28:46.129 --> 00:28:47.800
- Good luck. - Thank you.

578
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.000
Here are the scripts. Pardon?

579
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.399
- Thank you. - I'll call you.

580
00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.980
Yoon Ah, come outside.

581
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.020
What is it?

582
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.919
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

583
00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:12.020
Ta-da.

584
00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:16.889
(Sol's 100th Day Birthday)

585
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.469
(Happy 100th Day Birthday, Sol.)

586
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.399
(Grow up to be a healthy and wise person.)

587
00:29:25.399 --> 00:29:27.139
What's all this?

588
00:29:28.369 --> 00:29:30.740
Do you have to ask? Come here.

589
00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:34.149
It's for Sol's 100th day birthday.

590
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:39.080
It's not much, but we made everything.

591
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.850
Please accept it even if you don't like it.

592
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.490
I love it.

593
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.719
It's so pretty.

594
00:29:45.689 --> 00:29:47.219
Thank you, everyone.

595
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.800
Don't mention it. You should thank Dong Gu.

596
00:29:50.899 --> 00:29:52.859
It was Dong Gu's idea.

597
00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:54.070
Why would you say that?

598
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.100
Is that true? Thank you, Dong Gu.

599
00:29:57.869 --> 00:30:00.399
It's because I don't want you to cause trouble again.

600
00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.540
Don't cry so easily.

601
00:30:04.709 --> 00:30:07.310
You cry out of habit.

602
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:08.980
I'm sorry.

603
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.619
It's so pretty.

604
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.850
By the way, there's no cake.

605
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.290
It'd be perfect with a cake.

606
00:30:22.459 --> 00:30:25.199
The cake has arrived.

607
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.129
Of course we prepared a cake.

608
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.070
We can't have a party without any cake.

609
00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:32.939
Thank you.

610
00:30:32.939 --> 00:30:34.639
There you go again.

611
00:30:34.639 --> 00:30:37.280
Seo Jin, light the candles before she starts crying.

612
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280
- Okay. - Hurry.

613
00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:40.709
You bought champagne too?

614
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.550
That's thoughtful of you.

615
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.580
I bought it because I have something to celebrate.

616
00:30:44.649 --> 00:30:46.820
- What is it? - I've been...

617
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.090
casted in a morning drama.

618
00:30:49.449 --> 00:30:52.090
It's a regular role too.

619
00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:53.659
- Nice. - Really?

620
00:30:53.659 --> 00:30:54.659
A regular role? Really?

621
00:30:54.659 --> 00:30:56.990
This time, I'm the main character's...

622
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.260
driver.

623
00:30:58.459 --> 00:31:01.369
I knew it. It's a minor role again.

624
00:31:01.369 --> 00:31:03.800
Let's talk about that later.

625
00:31:04.139 --> 00:31:05.969
- Let's take some pictures first. - Okay.

626
00:31:05.969 --> 00:31:07.510
- Let's take pictures. - Let's do that.

627
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.070
Yoon Ah, come here.

628
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.080
Come this way.

629
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.379
Let's take pictures.

630
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.550
Guys, gather up.

631
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.179
Dong Gu, hurry up.

632
00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:18.719
- Smile. - Fine.

633
00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:21.590
A picture will be taken in 10 seconds. Put on a smile.

634
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.219
- All right. - Hurry up.

635
00:31:23.219 --> 00:31:25.290
Kimchi.

636
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.629
- Kimchi. - Kimchi.

637
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:29.129
Hold on.

638
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.129
We forgot a ring.

639
00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:35.230
It would have been perfect with a ring.

640
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:36.699
- A ring... - Yoon Ah...

641
00:31:36.699 --> 00:31:38.600
Seo Jin, go get a ring.

642
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.270
Why did you buy these?

643
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.540
Put away the table.

644
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.209
- Put it away. - No.

645
00:31:44.209 --> 00:31:45.879
- Go get a ring. - It's okay.

646
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.649
All right. I'll start.

647
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.520
Turning left.

648
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.730
Turning right.

649
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.300
Okay.

650
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:06.230
Backing up.

651
00:32:08.199 --> 00:32:09.300
That's one version.

652
00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.010
Turning left.

653
00:32:14.969 --> 00:32:16.169
Turning right.

654
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.310
Okay. Backing up.

655
00:32:21.209 --> 00:32:23.409
Which of the two versions was better?

656
00:32:23.449 --> 00:32:24.619
Be honest.

657
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.919
How are they different? They looked the same.

658
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.560
What?

659
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.159
Hey. In the first version,

660
00:32:35.159 --> 00:32:36.629
the driver does his best...

661
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:38.199
on whatever task he is given...

662
00:32:38.199 --> 00:32:39.800
so that he can become successful.

663
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.699
In the second version, the driver is bored and irritated.

664
00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:42.830
He does just enough,

665
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.540
so he doesn't get on his boss's wrong side.

666
00:32:47.939 --> 00:32:49.010
I see.

667
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.040
You want to become a director.

668
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.939
How can you not tell the difference?

669
00:32:51.939 --> 00:32:52.980
I'm sorry.

670
00:32:54.709 --> 00:32:57.580
This is my first regular role in a drama. I'm so worried.

671
00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.719
So am I.

672
00:32:58.719 --> 00:33:01.619
Should I have an in-depth interview with a driver?

673
00:33:01.619 --> 00:33:04.719
You have only three lines. An interview would be unnecessary.

674
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.719
You're so fussy.

675
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.590
Let him do whatever he wants.

676
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.129
What do you know about acting?

677
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.830
What's that?

678
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.730
I found an oven on the street. It looked perfectly fine,

679
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:16.929
so I brought it here.

680
00:33:16.969 --> 00:33:18.770
An oven? Why do you need it?

681
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.409
You said I could even sell my bread.

682
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.609
I'm thinking of doing that.

683
00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:24.939
Selling your bread?

684
00:33:24.939 --> 00:33:26.379
What about the guesthouse?

685
00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:28.679
I'll do it in my free time.

686
00:33:29.109 --> 00:33:30.879
All right. If you say so.

687
00:33:30.879 --> 00:33:31.919
But...

688
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:34.189
it shouldn't interfere with your work around the guesthouse.

689
00:33:34.189 --> 00:33:35.790
Okay. Don't worry.

690
00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:37.219
Gosh.

691
00:33:38.619 --> 00:33:39.659
My goodness.

692
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:42.659
I'm sorry.

693
00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.070

(Daeyoung Newspaper)

695
00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:00.879
- I got a text. - Check it.

696
00:34:04.449 --> 00:34:05.750
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

697
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.850
I'm too nervous. Can you check it for me?

698
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.659
Gosh. Okay.

699
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:15.790
What does it say?

700
00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:21.600
Too bad.

701
00:34:22.299 --> 00:34:23.299
Seo Jin.

702
00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:26.799
They want to...

703
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:30.110
interview you.

704
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.310
You passed the first round of screening!

705
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.250
Really?

706
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.380
Yes. Take a look.

707
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.920
(Congratulations on passing the first round.)

708
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.290
I passed!

709
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:43.889
You have to pass the interview too.

710
00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:45.190
Don't be too excited.

711
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.219
Whatever.

712
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:48.630
I really wanted to get into this company.

713
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.830
Congratulations.

714
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:50.960
You will get in.

715
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.830
Stop it. You look ugly.

716
00:34:55.529 --> 00:34:57.029
It smells like something's burning.

717
00:34:57.569 --> 00:34:59.000
I think it's coming from the kitchen.

718
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:00.839
What is it?

719
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:02.839
What's that? Why is it smoking so much?

720
00:35:02.839 --> 00:35:03.909
What is this?

721
00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:05.679
- What's this? - Why is it smoking?

722
00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:07.850
Oh, my. The bread must be burning.

723
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:09.810
- Turn off the oven right now. - Okay.

724
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.480
What's wrong? It won't turn off.

725
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.549
Gosh.

726
00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:16.920
Then unplug it.

727
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.420
It could have been dangerous.

728
00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.060
I'm sorry. The timer must be broken.

729
00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.600
Why would someone throw away something broken?

730
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.100
They must have thrown it away because it's broken.

731
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.739
- You're right. - What?

732
00:35:30.739 --> 00:35:32.299
You almost set this house on fire.

733
00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:34.770
Why did you bring the oven here?

734
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.210
Seo Jin passed the screening. Let's have a drink.

735
00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.839
- Calm down. - Gosh.

736
00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:40.040
- Stop it. - Stop it.

737
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.980
- If Seo Jin hadn't passed... - Come on.

738
00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.880
Gosh, why did she bring the oven here?

739
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.089
Yoon Ah, let's go.

740
00:35:48.089 --> 00:35:50.790
Go on. I want to clean up a bit first.

741
00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.759
Okay. Don't take too long.

742
00:36:09.969 --> 00:36:11.540
All right. Let's start.

743
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.009
Spin it. Come on.

744
00:36:13.009 --> 00:36:14.179
Let's do this.

745
00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:17.619
- Jun Ki. - Jun Ki.

746
00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:20.350
It's me. Okay.

747
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.650
Ask me anything.

748
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.290
I'll answer honestly.

749
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:24.460
Who wants to ask me a question?

750
00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.589
Me.

751
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:28.630
- Let me ask you one. - Sure.

752
00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.299
When and where did you have your first kiss? And with who?

753
00:36:32.299 --> 00:36:36.130
My first kiss... Was it in third grade?

754
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.600
It was in second grade.

755
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.009
It was with the girl next door.

756
00:36:41.009 --> 00:36:42.610
We were in the school playground.

757
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:45.980
As we slid down the elephant slide,

758
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.110
we passionately...

759
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.719
- Si Yeon's lips were hot and... - Stop it.

760
00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:53.779
Go upstairs!

761
00:36:53.779 --> 00:36:55.190
I don't want to hear any more.

762
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.589
What happens next?

763
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:58.460
You asked me. Be quiet.

764
00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:00.119
- Si Yeon? - My feelings got hurt.

765
00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:02.659
I cut up some fruit. Have some.

766
00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:04.100
Have you cleaned up the kitchen?

767
00:37:04.529 --> 00:37:05.830
Yes, it's clean now.

768
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.699
What about the smoke and the smell?

769
00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:09.569
Don't be so hard on her.

770
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.569
- Have a seat. - I'm okay.

771
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:13.799
Sit down. We're playing the truth game.

772
00:37:13.799 --> 00:37:15.110
Join us.

773
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.580
- Sit down. - You say no all the time.

774
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.480
- Is it really okay? - Of course.

775
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.179
Let's start again.

776
00:37:22.179 --> 00:37:24.719
- Okay. Go. - Let's go.

777
00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:25.850
Okay.

778
00:37:26.049 --> 00:37:28.150
Yoon Ah was chosen as soon as she began.

779
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.089
What naughty question should we ask her?

780
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.819
- Yoon Ah. - Me!

781
00:37:32.819 --> 00:37:34.290
Me. Let me ask her.

782
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.659
Are you a question machine or something?

783
00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:37.659
There's something I've wanted to ask you.

784
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.699
Really? What is it?

785
00:37:41.029 --> 00:37:42.900
Well...

786
00:37:43.529 --> 00:37:46.639
What happened between Sol's dad and you?

787
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.380
Why are you asking her that? You're making her uncomfortable.

788
00:37:54.509 --> 00:37:56.480
I know you guys are curious too.

789
00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.980
It's just that no one has had the courage to ask her. Am I wrong?

790
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.920
It's okay.

791
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.750
It's nothing to hide.

792
00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.819
Where do I begin?

793
00:38:11.026 --> 00:38:12.066
It's okay.

794
00:38:12.066 --> 00:38:13.896
It's nothing to hide.

795
00:38:15.206 --> 00:38:16.965
Where do I begin?

796
00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:23.523
Well... The thing is...

797
00:38:28.722 --> 00:38:30.363
That's what happened.

798
00:38:31.762 --> 00:38:32.892
So...

799
00:38:33.563 --> 00:38:36.202
You lost your parents in a fire when you were two...

800
00:38:36.363 --> 00:38:38.333
and were sent to your relatives.

801
00:38:39.133 --> 00:38:41.302
Your relatives took away the insurance money...

802
00:38:41.302 --> 00:38:42.903
and sent you to an orphanage.

803
00:38:42.903 --> 00:38:43.972
You were...

804
00:38:44.313 --> 00:38:46.443
abused by the director of the orphanage and ran away.

805
00:38:46.713 --> 00:38:50.043
You met Sol's dad while you were part-timing.

806
00:38:50.043 --> 00:38:52.282
His parents broke you two up,

807
00:38:52.713 --> 00:38:54.653
and you found out you were pregnant...

808
00:38:54.653 --> 00:38:56.023
after you broke up.

809
00:38:59.992 --> 00:39:01.122
Hold on.

810
00:39:01.122 --> 00:39:03.463
Sol's dad knew you were pregnant...

811
00:39:03.463 --> 00:39:05.233
and didn't do anything?

812
00:39:06.293 --> 00:39:08.662
Well, he doesn't know about Sol.

813
00:39:08.662 --> 00:39:09.702
Why?

814
00:39:11.173 --> 00:39:13.302
- What? - Well...

815
00:39:15.773 --> 00:39:18.213
Sol must've woken up. I'm going downstairs.

816
00:39:22.113 --> 00:39:23.813
I feel so bad for her.

817
00:39:24.753 --> 00:39:26.583
It must have been so hard.

818
00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:29.353
Dong Gu, you should treat her better.

819
00:39:29.353 --> 00:39:30.523
Stop giving her a hard time.

820
00:39:31.052 --> 00:39:33.052
When did I give her a hard time?

821
00:39:33.052 --> 00:39:36.363
You were harsh to her for almost causing a fire.

822
00:39:36.363 --> 00:39:39.133
I was only telling her to be careful.

823
00:39:39.133 --> 00:39:40.903
- You be careful. - Let's cheer without him.

824
00:39:41.032 --> 00:39:42.603
- Come. Cheers. - Cheers.

825
00:39:46.372 --> 00:39:47.543
Life is tough.

826
00:39:50.202 --> 00:39:53.342
Guys. Ta-da.

827
00:39:54.313 --> 00:39:55.383
How do I look?

828
00:39:56.012 --> 00:39:58.182
That's incredible.

829
00:39:58.412 --> 00:40:00.213
It doesn't look good on you.

830
00:40:00.552 --> 00:40:02.622
It's hard not to look good in it.

831
00:40:03.282 --> 00:40:05.622
I was a fool to ask you.

832
00:40:05.622 --> 00:40:06.853
I was kidding.

833
00:40:07.063 --> 00:40:08.822
Why are you dressed up?

834
00:40:09.222 --> 00:40:10.563
I have an interview today.

835
00:40:10.563 --> 00:40:13.633
Seeing you flippant like that makes me nervous.

836
00:40:13.733 --> 00:40:15.733
Don't worry.

837
00:40:16.032 --> 00:40:18.903
Shall I start my makeup?

838
00:40:19.233 --> 00:40:20.572
My goodness.

839
00:40:22.802 --> 00:40:24.543
What should I do?

840
00:40:24.543 --> 00:40:26.543
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

841
00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:29.282
My interview is coming up soon.

842
00:40:29.282 --> 00:40:30.583
Stop making a fuss.

843
00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:32.153
You can change into a new shirt.

844
00:40:32.153 --> 00:40:35.122
No, this blouse goes with this jacket.

845
00:40:35.322 --> 00:40:36.923
Another blouse won't match.

846
00:40:36.923 --> 00:40:39.023
You still have time to wash and dry it.

847
00:40:39.153 --> 00:40:40.253
I should do that.

848
00:40:46.133 --> 00:40:47.302
What are you doing, Yoon Ah?

849
00:40:48.262 --> 00:40:51.233
- Are you going to sell muffins? - Yes.

850
00:40:51.233 --> 00:40:52.472
Do you need our help?

851
00:40:52.472 --> 00:40:54.273
No, I'm almost done.

852
00:40:56.543 --> 00:40:57.673
It's done.

853
00:40:59.972 --> 00:41:01.113
Sol must be awake.

854
00:41:05.253 --> 00:41:07.753
She's busy taking care of her baby, doing chores, and selling muffins.

855
00:41:08.282 --> 00:41:10.052
Her life isn't easy either.

856
00:41:11.092 --> 00:41:12.153
You're right.

857
00:41:12.653 --> 00:41:15.492
Is there any way we can help her?

858
00:41:15.662 --> 00:41:18.392
I'd like to, but what could we do for her?

859
00:41:18.733 --> 00:41:20.963
We can't get her a husband.

860
00:41:22.762 --> 00:41:23.903
That sounds good.

861
00:41:23.972 --> 00:41:25.903
Shall we look for Sol's dad?

862
00:41:25.903 --> 00:41:27.543
How could we even look for him?

863
00:41:28.003 --> 00:41:30.472
That's true. How could we?

864
00:41:35.883 --> 00:41:37.153
Isn't it Yoon Ah's phone?

865
00:41:37.253 --> 00:41:38.452
I think so.

866
00:41:38.452 --> 00:41:40.012
We can look up his number.

867
00:41:40.253 --> 00:41:42.222
How would we know which one is his?

868
00:41:42.383 --> 00:41:43.583
We can search.

869
00:41:45.592 --> 00:41:47.092
- What's this? - What?

870
00:41:47.392 --> 00:41:50.023
Other than our phone numbers, there are only two people...

871
00:41:50.023 --> 00:41:51.293
in her contact list.

872
00:41:52.063 --> 00:41:54.262
Kim Jun Sung must be him.

873
00:41:54.403 --> 00:41:56.532
- No way. - It can't be Great Wall of China.

874
00:41:56.532 --> 00:41:59.333
I mean how do we know that's Sol's dad?

875
00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:00.543
Right.

876
00:42:00.543 --> 00:42:03.142
We can call him to find out.

877
00:42:03.202 --> 00:42:06.012
- Are you crazy? Don't do that. - Let me go.

878
00:42:06.012 --> 00:42:08.113
- We can try. - You'll cause trouble.

879
00:42:08.583 --> 00:42:09.912
My goodness.

880
00:42:14.552 --> 00:42:15.622
Hello?

881
00:42:15.822 --> 00:42:19.353
Is this Kim Jun Sung's cell phone?

882
00:42:19.452 --> 00:42:21.063
- That's correct. - Stop it.

883
00:42:21.063 --> 00:42:23.662
Do you happen to know Han Yoon Ah?

884
00:42:23.793 --> 00:42:27.133
I dated her for a bit. Who's calling?

885
00:42:27.133 --> 00:42:29.762
They were seeing each other. This must be him.

886
00:42:31.802 --> 00:42:33.302
This is delivery service.

887
00:42:33.472 --> 00:42:36.673
Han Yoon Ah sent you a package.

888
00:42:36.673 --> 00:42:38.972
What's your home address?

889
00:42:38.972 --> 00:42:41.512
I can't read the address because it was erased by the rain.

890
00:42:41.512 --> 00:42:42.912
It's sunny today.

891
00:42:43.142 --> 00:42:45.052
Yes, wait one moment.

892
00:42:46.213 --> 00:42:48.182
35 Dongsan-ro?

893
00:42:48.452 --> 00:42:50.693
I'll send it to you.

894
00:42:51.153 --> 00:42:53.452
This is Sol's dad.

895
00:42:53.452 --> 00:42:55.423
Shall we look up the address?

896
00:42:55.423 --> 00:42:57.162
This is too...

897
00:42:57.293 --> 00:42:59.233
Stay out of it. I'll go alone.

898
00:42:59.233 --> 00:43:00.333
You're not loyal at all.

899
00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:02.233
Fine, I'll come with you.

900
00:43:02.262 --> 00:43:03.662
Where are you going?

901
00:43:03.662 --> 00:43:05.202
- It's none of your business. - What?

902
00:43:05.202 --> 00:43:06.702
- Loyalty. - What's wrong with you?

903
00:43:06.802 --> 00:43:08.802
What trouble will they cause this time?

904
00:43:10.842 --> 00:43:12.813
- Are you going out? - I'm going to sell muffins.

905
00:43:12.872 --> 00:43:14.443
Are you serious?

906
00:43:14.543 --> 00:43:16.342
Not everyone can sell their products.

907
00:43:16.342 --> 00:43:17.883
I'll give it a try anyway.

908
00:43:18.353 --> 00:43:21.222
Wait, do you need me to carry it?

909
00:43:21.222 --> 00:43:22.722
No, I can do it myself.

910
00:43:22.722 --> 00:43:23.793
See you.

911
00:43:23.892 --> 00:43:25.353
It won't be easy alone.

912
00:43:26.793 --> 00:43:30.092
Is she going to sell them while holding her baby?

913
00:43:30.193 --> 00:43:32.662
Forget it. It's none of my business.

914
00:43:38.673 --> 00:43:41.372
Buy some muffins. These are homemade.

915
00:43:41.472 --> 00:43:42.572
Buy muffins.

916
00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:46.113
Buy some muffins. These are homemade.

917
00:43:46.572 --> 00:43:48.813
Hello, these are homemade muffins.

918
00:43:48.813 --> 00:43:49.983
Try some.

919
00:43:56.122 --> 00:43:57.253
Let's see.

920
00:44:00.092 --> 00:44:01.322
Hello.

921
00:44:02.363 --> 00:44:03.423
Dong Gu?

922
00:44:03.523 --> 00:44:04.793
What brings you here?

923
00:44:04.793 --> 00:44:06.592
I saw you while passing by.

924
00:44:07.932 --> 00:44:09.233
How is it going?

925
00:44:11.133 --> 00:44:12.872
It doesn't seem like it.

926
00:44:13.372 --> 00:44:14.972
What are you doing?

927
00:44:14.972 --> 00:44:16.802
It's hard on you and Sol.

928
00:44:17.113 --> 00:44:19.242
Not everyone can sell their products.

929
00:44:19.572 --> 00:44:21.943
You can easily buy muffins at the bakery.

930
00:44:21.943 --> 00:44:25.313
Who would buy them on the street?

931
00:44:25.313 --> 00:44:27.253
They aren't marketable.

932
00:44:27.253 --> 00:44:29.822
The handwriting looks careless.

933
00:44:29.822 --> 00:44:32.853
What kind of names are these?

934
00:44:32.853 --> 00:44:34.923
Why did you name them like that?

935
00:44:34.923 --> 00:44:36.193
Didn't I tell you...

936
00:44:41.133 --> 00:44:43.972
Yoon Ah, are you crying?

937
00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:47.142
I feel bad already because I can't sell them.

938
00:44:47.642 --> 00:44:49.503
Now that you said that,

939
00:44:50.072 --> 00:44:51.742
I feel terrible.

940
00:44:52.142 --> 00:44:56.012
Gosh, no. You shouldn't cry.

941
00:44:56.012 --> 00:44:57.282
You're an adult.

942
00:44:57.952 --> 00:45:00.153
- I'm sorry. - Goodness.

943
00:45:07.662 --> 00:45:09.963
People are looking. Stop crying.

944
00:45:11.762 --> 00:45:13.092
Gosh.

945
00:45:14.202 --> 00:45:17.103
I'll sell them for you.

946
00:45:17.103 --> 00:45:19.233
I'll help you, okay?

947
00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:21.673
- Really? - So stop crying.

948
00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:23.972
Okay? Stop crying.

949
00:45:24.443 --> 00:45:26.142
I'll stop.

950
00:45:27.412 --> 00:45:29.412
This is the address.

951
00:45:30.952 --> 00:45:32.052
This must be it.

952
00:45:32.912 --> 00:45:35.552
No matter how much I think about it, I think this is wrong.

953
00:45:35.923 --> 00:45:37.523
Let's go back.

954
00:45:37.853 --> 00:45:39.222
If you want to leave, go by yourself.

955
00:45:39.222 --> 00:45:41.523
You have no loyalty. You should be ashamed.

956
00:45:42.492 --> 00:45:43.762
Where's the boss?

957
00:45:43.762 --> 00:45:44.963
Be careful.

958
00:45:44.963 --> 00:45:47.702
- There's the boss. - Wait. Goodness.

959
00:45:50.202 --> 00:45:53.133
- Excuse me, sir. - Yes?

960
00:45:53.233 --> 00:45:55.943
Is this Kim Jun Sung's house?

961
00:45:55.943 --> 00:45:57.072
Why do you ask?

962
00:45:57.412 --> 00:46:00.543
We need to talk to him.

963
00:46:00.543 --> 00:46:02.142
This is so annoying.

964
00:46:02.983 --> 00:46:04.213
- Hey. - Yes?

965
00:46:04.213 --> 00:46:05.483
Someone is here to see you.

966
00:46:05.552 --> 00:46:06.782
- Me? - Yes.

967
00:46:07.153 --> 00:46:08.452
Who are you?

968
00:46:08.753 --> 00:46:10.423
- Are you Kim Jun Sung? - Yes.

969
00:46:10.822 --> 00:46:12.653
Hello, I'm Lee Jun Ki.

970
00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:16.092
We have something important to tell you.

971
00:46:16.193 --> 00:46:18.633
Is that so? What is it?

972
00:46:18.633 --> 00:46:21.233
- Do you know... - Honey.

973
00:46:21.863 --> 00:46:24.233
How long will the construction take?

974
00:46:24.233 --> 00:46:25.802
We don't have much time left.

975
00:46:26.372 --> 00:46:29.273
It'll be over before our wedding, so don't worry.

976
00:46:29.903 --> 00:46:31.773
Who are these people?

977
00:46:31.773 --> 00:46:35.113
They came to tell me something.

978
00:46:35.213 --> 00:46:36.583
What is it?

979
00:46:36.642 --> 00:46:39.213
Well, I...

980
00:46:41.083 --> 00:46:42.322
I came for a part-time job.

981
00:46:43.653 --> 00:46:45.122
- Part-time job? - Part-time job?

982
00:46:45.122 --> 00:46:47.523
We aren't looking for part-timers.

983
00:46:48.923 --> 00:46:50.363
Mr. Choi sent you, didn't he?

984
00:46:50.532 --> 00:46:53.432
I complained yesterday that we need more workers.

985
00:46:53.662 --> 00:46:54.903
He finally sent them.

986
00:46:55.262 --> 00:46:58.802
Yes, it was... It was Mr. Choi.

987
00:46:58.802 --> 00:47:01.443
Then you should come see me instead.

988
00:47:01.443 --> 00:47:03.273
Why would you look for Mr. Kim?

989
00:47:03.673 --> 00:47:04.773
Follow me.

990
00:47:05.813 --> 00:47:06.972
Okay, sir.

991
00:47:08.443 --> 00:47:10.383
What's this all about? What part-time job?

992
00:47:10.383 --> 00:47:12.512
I couldn't talk about Yoon Ah in front of his fiancee.

993
00:47:12.512 --> 00:47:13.983
I told you not to come here.

994
00:47:13.983 --> 00:47:16.122
- Let's go. - That's a good idea.

995
00:47:20.693 --> 00:47:21.963
Where do you think you're going?

996
00:47:24.133 --> 00:47:25.233
Right.

997
00:47:26.833 --> 00:47:28.603
You misunderstood.

998
00:47:29.233 --> 00:47:30.403
We have a lot to do.

999
00:47:30.403 --> 00:47:32.133
What happened was...

1000
00:47:33.603 --> 00:47:34.773
I...

1001
00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:36.702
So...

1002
00:47:36.773 --> 00:47:37.912
Listen.

1003
00:47:38.273 --> 00:47:40.742
- Goodness, follow me. - Gosh.

1004
00:47:40.742 --> 00:47:43.282
- Du Shik. You got it wrong, sir. - Where are you going?

1005
00:47:43.282 --> 00:47:44.952
- Sir. - Jun Ki.

1006
00:47:50.023 --> 00:47:51.793
I'm sorry, sir.

1007
00:47:52.622 --> 00:47:54.722
What are we doing? How long do we need to do this?

1008
00:47:54.722 --> 00:47:57.092
What can I do? He wouldn't listen.

1009
00:47:58.833 --> 00:47:59.932
See?

1010
00:48:00.503 --> 00:48:02.633
- Hurry up. - Fine.

1011
00:48:02.633 --> 00:48:03.702
Go now.

1012
00:48:04.903 --> 00:48:06.003
Go.

1013
00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:07.773
Follow me.

1014
00:48:11.443 --> 00:48:13.273
Why won't it dry?

1015
00:48:13.273 --> 00:48:14.883
What if I'm late for the interview?

1016
00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:17.182
Excuse me? Is anybody here?

1017
00:48:17.452 --> 00:48:19.653
What? Isn't anyone outside?

1018
00:48:19.753 --> 00:48:21.083
Darn it.

1019
00:48:26.693 --> 00:48:28.523
- What do you want? - I'm sorry.

1020
00:48:28.863 --> 00:48:30.023
Can I get an extra towel?

1021
00:48:30.023 --> 00:48:31.532
I'm already busy.

1022
00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:34.363
Where are the others?

1023
00:48:35.302 --> 00:48:37.503
Gosh, I'm late.

1024
00:48:38.472 --> 00:48:40.472
Hey, I'm busy right now.

1025
00:48:40.472 --> 00:48:43.572
- Towels are over there. Go find it. - All right.

1026
00:48:43.572 --> 00:48:46.113
Also, look after the guesthouse while I'm gone, okay?

1027
00:48:46.113 --> 00:48:47.642
- Say what? - Do you understand?

1028
00:48:48.813 --> 00:48:50.083
Yes, I got it.

1029
00:48:57.693 --> 00:48:58.853
Buy some muffins.

1030
00:48:59.222 --> 00:49:01.092
They're delicious.

1031
00:49:02.293 --> 00:49:04.333
What are you doing? You should be louder.

1032
00:49:05.392 --> 00:49:06.633
I am loud.

1033
00:49:06.693 --> 00:49:07.932
Buy some muffins.

1034
00:49:07.932 --> 00:49:11.333
They're... delicious.

1035
00:49:11.432 --> 00:49:13.572
These are homemade muffins.

1036
00:49:13.702 --> 00:49:17.043
Let's go back home. No one is buying them.

1037
00:49:17.043 --> 00:49:20.273
If I don't sell all of them today, I have to throw them away.

1038
00:49:20.383 --> 00:49:22.412
You sure are stubborn.

1039
00:49:23.242 --> 00:49:25.682
Yoon Ah. Just out of curiosity,

1040
00:49:26.153 --> 00:49:27.682
why do you choose to live a hard life?

1041
00:49:27.883 --> 00:49:29.423
What do you mean?

1042
00:49:29.423 --> 00:49:30.693
I'm talking about Sol.

1043
00:49:31.322 --> 00:49:34.423
Have you thought about meeting the father and telling him about Sol?

1044
00:49:34.423 --> 00:49:35.423
No.

1045
00:49:35.662 --> 00:49:37.463
That's never crossed my mind.

1046
00:49:37.463 --> 00:49:39.592
Isn't it tough raising a child on your own?

1047
00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:42.262
Of course it's tough.

1048
00:49:42.662 --> 00:49:45.773
I don't want Sol to be the reason for us to get back to together.

1049
00:49:46.773 --> 00:49:48.503
He has nothing to do with how I'm living now.

1050
00:49:48.943 --> 00:49:50.572
She's my daughter.

1051
00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:55.043
I'm going to do my best to raise her well on my own.

1052
00:49:56.182 --> 00:49:58.682
That's why I decided to start my own business.

1053
00:50:01.423 --> 00:50:03.253
If you're tired, why don't you go on home first?

1054
00:50:03.253 --> 00:50:05.523
I'm going to stay hear a little longer. You go ahead.

1055
00:50:05.523 --> 00:50:06.523
My goodness.

1056
00:50:06.622 --> 00:50:10.122
Nonsense. The day's almost over. Why would I leave now?

1057
00:50:11.932 --> 00:50:15.603
Please buy these muffins. Buy these muffins. They're good.

1058
00:50:15.603 --> 00:50:17.972
Buy these muffins. They're delicious.

1059
00:50:17.972 --> 00:50:19.932
Please buy these muffins.

1060
00:50:20.032 --> 00:50:21.673
Please buy these muffins.

1061
00:50:21.673 --> 00:50:23.742
Buy these muffins. I've tasted them myself.

1062
00:50:23.742 --> 00:50:25.242
They're really good. I wonder why people won't buy them?

1063
00:50:25.443 --> 00:50:27.682
These are delicious. Please buy these.

1064
00:50:27.682 --> 00:50:29.613
What are you guys doing here?

1065
00:50:29.613 --> 00:50:32.253
Pardon? We're selling muffins.

1066
00:50:32.253 --> 00:50:33.853
I'm assuming you have a permit to sell these here, right?

1067
00:50:33.853 --> 00:50:35.153
Yes, of course.

1068
00:50:35.153 --> 00:50:36.653
Dong Gu here gave me permission.

1069
00:50:36.782 --> 00:50:38.253
I gave her permission.

1070
00:50:38.523 --> 00:50:39.822
What seems to be the problem, sir?

1071
00:50:40.722 --> 00:50:43.423
This interview is unique isn't it?

1072
00:50:43.423 --> 00:50:45.092
Relax. Don't be nervous.

1073
00:50:45.092 --> 00:50:47.432
Let's enjoy the meal while having a couple of drinks.

1074
00:50:47.432 --> 00:50:49.963
- Let's talk casually, all right? - Yes, sir.

1075
00:50:49.963 --> 00:50:52.633
Go ahead and take off your jackets. You can relax.

1076
00:50:52.633 --> 00:50:53.702
Yes, sir.

1077
00:50:58.742 --> 00:51:01.383
That's strange. My blouse.

1078
00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:03.412
Where's my blouse?

1079
00:51:07.452 --> 00:51:10.322
Gosh. I must've lost my mind. I can't believe this.

1080
00:51:11.193 --> 00:51:12.423
What are you doing, Miss Kang?

1081
00:51:12.423 --> 00:51:13.863
I told you to take off your jacket and relax.

1082
00:51:13.863 --> 00:51:14.923
I'm all right, sir.

1083
00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:16.863
I'm a bit cold actually.

1084
00:51:17.162 --> 00:51:18.662
Is that right?

1085
00:51:18.662 --> 00:51:20.532
Do as you please then.

1086
00:51:22.563 --> 00:51:24.072
Your meat will be served.

1087
00:51:28.773 --> 00:51:30.872
- My goodness. - My goodness.

1088
00:51:31.242 --> 00:51:32.742
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

1089
00:51:32.742 --> 00:51:34.912
Please give it to me. I'll go wash it out for you.

1090
00:51:35.412 --> 00:51:37.583
No. I'll do it.

1091
00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:39.353
No. I'll do it. Please give me your jacket.

1092
00:51:39.353 --> 00:51:40.353
I told you it's all right.

1093
00:51:40.782 --> 00:51:42.383
Please let me take care of it.

1094
00:51:43.122 --> 00:51:44.523
I'm fine.

1095
00:51:44.952 --> 00:51:47.023
Please just leave.

1096
00:51:47.463 --> 00:51:48.963
- Let's go. - Good work.

1097
00:51:48.963 --> 00:51:50.092
- Good work. - Good work.

1098
00:51:50.092 --> 00:51:51.463
Hey. Hey!

1099
00:51:52.463 --> 00:51:53.492
Hurry up and come over here.

1100
00:51:54.003 --> 00:51:55.302
You guys did a good job.

1101
00:51:55.302 --> 00:51:57.372
Get home safely. Come again tomorrow, okay?

1102
00:51:57.372 --> 00:51:59.032
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1103
00:52:01.702 --> 00:52:04.043
Hey. Wait up for me.

1104
00:52:04.773 --> 00:52:06.642
Gosh. How much is this?

1105
00:52:07.682 --> 00:52:10.342
The manager doesn't look that nice, but he's generous. Don't you agree?

1106
00:52:10.483 --> 00:52:11.813
Are you that happy?

1107
00:52:12.113 --> 00:52:13.983
You sure must be happy that you earned a lot.

1108
00:52:13.983 --> 00:52:15.782
What are you doing? Let's go now. I'm exhausted.

1109
00:52:16.222 --> 00:52:18.722
- Don't you do that. - Okay, okay, okay.

1110
00:52:19.153 --> 00:52:21.722
By the way, I think I saw the girlfriend leave.

1111
00:52:21.963 --> 00:52:23.363
Shall we go and tell him about Yoon Ah?

1112
00:52:23.363 --> 00:52:24.633
Jun Ki. Are you crazy?

1113
00:52:24.633 --> 00:52:27.333
That guy is getting married soon.

1114
00:52:27.463 --> 00:52:30.162
If he finds out now that he has a baby, what do you think will happen?

1115
00:52:30.333 --> 00:52:32.833
His marriage will be called off in no time. Do you understand?

1116
00:52:32.932 --> 00:52:34.403
- What did you just say? - Pardon?

1117
00:52:37.613 --> 00:52:40.242
Yoon Ah gave birth to my child?

1118
00:52:40.242 --> 00:52:41.412
Is that really true?

1119
00:52:47.782 --> 00:52:50.153
Do you two have boyfriends?

1120
00:52:50.353 --> 00:52:53.523
I don't have a boyfriend.

1121
00:52:53.923 --> 00:52:55.722
I don't have one yet either.

1122
00:52:55.722 --> 00:52:56.822
Really?

1123
00:52:57.262 --> 00:53:01.103
That's a surprise. I think you'd be popular among the guys.

1124
00:53:01.603 --> 00:53:05.472
Us guys like glamorous girls like you.

1125
00:53:05.802 --> 00:53:06.833
Excuse me?

1126
00:53:08.642 --> 00:53:09.673
Why are you looking at me like that?

1127
00:53:10.872 --> 00:53:12.142
Would this be sexual harassment?

1128
00:53:12.142 --> 00:53:14.083
I'm sorry. I apologize. It was just a joke.

1129
00:53:15.282 --> 00:53:16.943
Females these days scare me.

1130
00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:19.282
I have to watch what I say.

1131
00:53:21.023 --> 00:53:24.492
Please excuse me. I need to go to the restroom.

1132
00:53:27.193 --> 00:53:29.363
I can't believe him He's a complete jerk.

1133
00:53:29.363 --> 00:53:30.992
Normally, I'd just smack guys like him.

1134
00:53:33.762 --> 00:53:34.802
No. Wait.

1135
00:53:35.503 --> 00:53:37.302
Seo Jin. You should control your temper.

1136
00:53:37.532 --> 00:53:40.742
You want to get hired this time, right?

1137
00:53:46.443 --> 00:53:47.813
(2018 Daeyoung Newspaper Job Interview)

1138
00:53:53.722 --> 00:53:55.322
Miss Yoon. After this interview,

1139
00:53:55.322 --> 00:53:57.523
why don't you and I go somewhere nice and have some more drinks?

1140
00:53:58.423 --> 00:54:00.392
Actually, I have plans.

1141
00:54:00.423 --> 00:54:01.463
What plans?

1142
00:54:01.463 --> 00:54:03.793
Is it more important than getting this job?

1143
00:54:03.793 --> 00:54:06.762
You must not care if you fail the interview.

1144
00:54:06.963 --> 00:54:09.932
- It's not that, sir. - Let's just have a couple drinks.

1145
00:54:09.932 --> 00:54:12.233
Don't get me wrong. You just seem like a little sister to me.

1146
00:54:12.603 --> 00:54:15.603
Miss Yoon. Don't you want to get hired?

1147
00:54:20.142 --> 00:54:21.682
She said no.

1148
00:54:21.782 --> 00:54:23.512
What did you just say?

1149
00:54:23.512 --> 00:54:26.153
What? She seems like a little sister to you?

1150
00:54:26.153 --> 00:54:27.822
If you want to drink that badly,

1151
00:54:27.822 --> 00:54:30.182
why don't you have your real sister come drink with you?

1152
00:54:30.992 --> 00:54:33.253
What? Hey.

1153
00:54:33.492 --> 00:54:35.693
- Have you lost your mind? - Get your hand off me...

1154
00:54:36.293 --> 00:54:38.133
when I tell you nicely.

1155
00:54:38.492 --> 00:54:40.063
If you don't tell me nicely, what else can you do?

1156
00:54:40.063 --> 00:54:42.063
What? Are you going to take a swing at me?

1157
00:54:43.133 --> 00:54:44.233
Then try hitting me.

1158
00:54:44.233 --> 00:54:46.532
Go ahead. Hit me.

1159
00:54:47.142 --> 00:54:48.903
Why? You don't have the guts?

1160
00:54:49.142 --> 00:54:51.813
Don't try to show off. You should watch who you're dealing with.

1161
00:54:51.813 --> 00:54:53.943
How dare you act rude to me?

1162
00:55:02.523 --> 00:55:05.653
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

1163
00:55:05.653 --> 00:55:07.092
If you want to press charges, go right ahead.

1164
00:55:07.193 --> 00:55:09.662
I'll counter-charge you for sexual harassment.

1165
00:55:11.693 --> 00:55:13.833
Get up. You don't have to go through an interview like this.

1166
00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:15.103
Let go of me.

1167
00:55:15.233 --> 00:55:17.003
- Excuse me? - What's wrong with you?

1168
00:55:17.302 --> 00:55:20.233
Are you willing to take the blame if I don't pass this interview?

1169
00:55:20.543 --> 00:55:23.842
Why did you do such a thing? This can cause me harm as well.

1170
00:55:26.543 --> 00:55:27.642
Please forgive me.

1171
00:55:27.943 --> 00:55:29.883
Are you injured?

1172
00:55:31.253 --> 00:55:33.012
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

1173
00:55:33.313 --> 00:55:34.682
I'll do it for you.

1174
00:55:35.083 --> 00:55:36.282
My goodness.

1175
00:55:38.923 --> 00:55:41.092
I'm aching all over.

1176
00:55:43.222 --> 00:55:45.463
Jun Ki. Do you think...

1177
00:55:45.932 --> 00:55:47.503
what we did was a mistake?

1178
00:55:49.403 --> 00:55:50.503
What do you mean by "we"?

1179
00:55:51.003 --> 00:55:54.642
Hey. You're the one that said it. It was you.

1180
00:55:55.443 --> 00:55:56.503
What?

1181
00:55:56.503 --> 00:55:58.113
Are you going to act like a jerk?

1182
00:55:58.113 --> 00:55:59.742
Are you going to make me take all the blame?

1183
00:55:59.742 --> 00:56:01.642
What did I do? What did I do?

1184
00:56:01.642 --> 00:56:03.443
You're the one that told him. You told him.

1185
00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:05.383
You said it with that mouth of yours. You did it. Yes, you.

1186
00:56:05.383 --> 00:56:06.912
Have you lost your mind?

1187
00:56:06.912 --> 00:56:09.023
You're a complete jerk. You jerk!

1188
00:56:09.023 --> 00:56:10.693
Jerk? How dare you say such a thing. I'm older than you.

1189
00:56:10.693 --> 00:56:12.023
- What else would I call a jerk? - What? Jerk?

1190
00:56:12.023 --> 00:56:14.063
- You jerk. - You guys are at it again?

1191
00:56:14.222 --> 00:56:15.293
You guys can't stop fighting.

1192
00:56:15.762 --> 00:56:16.892
What happened?

1193
00:56:17.193 --> 00:56:19.892
Wash your faces. Wash your faces, will you?

1194
00:56:19.892 --> 00:56:22.003
Welcome home. How come you two came together?

1195
00:56:22.063 --> 00:56:24.103
We met up front.

1196
00:56:24.103 --> 00:56:26.472
Yoon Ah. Did you sell your muffins?

1197
00:56:27.043 --> 00:56:29.003
Well, you see...

1198
00:56:29.003 --> 00:56:31.242
She had everything taken away by the control squad.

1199
00:56:31.472 --> 00:56:33.842
For illegal peddling and violating the Food Sanitation Act,

1200
00:56:33.842 --> 00:56:35.412
she even paid a fine.

1201
00:56:35.583 --> 00:56:37.853
- Really? - It's all my fault.

1202
00:56:38.052 --> 00:56:39.412
I should have done research.

1203
00:56:40.253 --> 00:56:41.722
- You guys are hungry, right? - Yes.

1204
00:56:41.722 --> 00:56:44.023
Sol has fallen asleep. I'll put her in bed,

1205
00:56:44.023 --> 00:56:45.492
and then hurry up and prepare dinner.

1206
00:56:45.722 --> 00:56:47.162
All right.

1207
00:56:49.222 --> 00:56:50.363
How could you call me a jerk?

1208
00:56:50.363 --> 00:56:52.092
How could you give me all the blame?

1209
00:56:52.092 --> 00:56:53.363
- You jerk. - You did it.

1210
00:56:53.363 --> 00:56:54.702
You asked me to go. Now you blame me?

1211
00:56:54.702 --> 00:56:55.762
- Is anyone here? - You jerk.

1212
00:56:55.762 --> 00:56:57.372
Welcome.

1213
00:56:57.403 --> 00:56:58.432
I know that voice.

1214
00:57:07.742 --> 00:57:09.512
I'm here to meet Han Yoon Ah.

1215
00:57:11.383 --> 00:57:12.552
Yoon Ah?

1216
00:57:13.383 --> 00:57:14.483
Who might you be?

1217
00:57:15.983 --> 00:57:17.092
Jun Sung?

1218
00:57:17.923 --> 00:57:18.952
Yoon Ah.

1219
00:57:22.023 --> 00:57:24.563
- What are you doing here? - We need to talk.

1220
00:57:24.563 --> 00:57:27.903
What just happened? What's going on?

1221
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:29.702
- Who is that? - You see,

1222
00:57:31.072 --> 00:57:32.133
He's Sol's father.

1223
00:57:32.802 --> 00:57:34.872
What? Sol's father?

1224
00:57:35.572 --> 00:57:37.173
How did he know she was here?

1225
00:57:37.173 --> 00:57:39.642
Actually, we went to meet him...

1226
00:57:40.072 --> 00:57:41.842
- to tell him about Sol. - What?

1227
00:57:42.412 --> 00:57:44.153
Why would you do such a thing? Are you guys crazy?

1228
00:57:44.153 --> 00:57:46.583
Are you crazy? I didn't do anything. He's said everything.

1229
00:57:46.583 --> 00:57:48.952
He must've lost his mind. What are you going to do about Sol?

1230
00:57:48.952 --> 00:57:51.153
How can you do this do me. You're a traitor. You jerk.

1231
00:57:51.153 --> 00:57:53.492
- Jerk? - I told you not to do that.

1232
00:57:53.492 --> 00:57:55.262
That's not what's important right now.

1233
00:57:55.293 --> 00:57:57.592
Hurry up. Hurry. Let's follow them.

1234
00:57:57.592 --> 00:58:00.603
Why should we follow them? It's none of our business.

1235
00:58:00.603 --> 00:58:01.702
Hurry up. Let's go.

1236
00:58:06.413 --> 00:58:08.952
What's going on? What are you doing here?

1237
00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:09.952
Yoon Ah.

1238
00:58:10.623 --> 00:58:12.382
Do you intend on ruining my life?

1239
00:58:12.382 --> 00:58:15.322
- What? What are you talking about? - Listen to me carefully.

1240
00:58:15.322 --> 00:58:18.322
I'm getting married soon. So here.

1241
00:58:18.492 --> 00:58:19.992
Just take this.

1242
00:58:20.393 --> 00:58:23.293
Take this, and don't contact me again. Do you understand?

1243
00:58:23.293 --> 00:58:25.262
- What? What's he doing? - What is it?

1244
00:58:25.262 --> 00:58:27.632
- Wait. What is this? - Isn't this enough?

1245
00:58:27.632 --> 00:58:30.972
I'm sure you planned on earning a fortune. This doesn't satisfy you?

1246
00:58:30.972 --> 00:58:33.072
You should be grateful that I'm even giving you this.

1247
00:58:33.342 --> 00:58:36.273
Honestly, how would I know who that child's father really is?

1248
00:58:37.143 --> 00:58:39.043
What on earth is he saying?

1249
00:58:39.043 --> 00:58:41.413
- That jerk. - Dong Gu. Wait.

1250
00:58:41.413 --> 00:58:44.123
How do I know you're not lying just to get money?

1251
00:58:44.382 --> 00:58:47.083
What are you talking about? You show up here, and... Gosh!

1252
00:58:49.353 --> 00:58:52.822
You jerk. How dare you say such a thing?

1253
00:58:52.963 --> 00:58:55.762
Hey. Do you even know how she's living right now?

1254
00:58:55.762 --> 00:58:56.893
I can't believe his temper.

1255
00:58:56.992 --> 00:58:58.563
Did you say she intended on getting lucky?

1256
00:58:58.563 --> 00:59:00.833
Dong Gu. What are you doing?

1257
00:59:00.833 --> 00:59:03.032
A jerk like him doesn't have the right to be Sol's father.

1258
00:59:03.032 --> 00:59:04.842
- Do you know what he deserves? - Wait a minute.

1259
00:59:06.742 --> 00:59:07.943
Did you refer to him as Sol's father?

1260
00:59:07.943 --> 00:59:09.713
What on earth are you talking about?

1261
00:59:09.813 --> 00:59:11.443
That guy's not Sol's father.

1262
00:59:15.012 --> 00:59:17.422
What? He's not Sol's father?

1263
00:59:17.623 --> 00:59:18.882
Then who is he?

1264
00:59:18.882 --> 00:59:21.722
He's just a guy I went on a blind date with.

1265
00:59:22.693 --> 00:59:25.563
But why was his number saved on your cellphone.

1266
00:59:25.563 --> 00:59:26.722
It was so that I could block his calls.

1267
00:59:26.822 --> 00:59:29.592
He kept calling and coming to see me after drinking a lot.

1268
00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:31.463
Then why did you come to see her?

1269
00:59:31.563 --> 00:59:34.202
On the day of our blind date, I blacked out after drinking with her.

1270
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:37.643
I thought something could have happened that night.

1271
00:59:39.273 --> 00:59:40.373
This is so embarrassing.

1272
00:59:41.213 --> 00:59:44.882
It was crazy of me to have listened to these idiots.

1273
00:59:44.882 --> 00:59:46.342
Gosh. I can't believe you two.

1274
00:59:46.443 --> 00:59:47.512
Wait right there.

1275
00:59:48.313 --> 00:59:50.313
Do you think I'll let you get off that easily after hitting me?

1276
00:59:50.782 --> 00:59:51.882
Pardon?

1277
00:59:53.992 --> 00:59:55.492
You see,

1278
00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:58.623
I had a job interview today.

1279
00:59:59.592 --> 01:00:01.793
I don't think I have a chance of passing though.

1280
01:00:02.663 --> 01:00:03.833
I...

1281
01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:09.032
took a piece of pork ribs and slapped the interviewer...

1282
01:00:09.132 --> 01:00:10.742
across the face.

1283
01:00:12.873 --> 01:00:17.382
He was a complete jerk.

1284
01:00:18.543 --> 01:00:19.713
But...

1285
01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:23.313
they said I was wrong.

1286
01:00:25.052 --> 01:00:26.183
Apparently,

1287
01:00:27.592 --> 01:00:29.023
I made a mistake.

1288
01:00:31.592 --> 01:00:32.992
Honestly,

1289
01:00:34.193 --> 01:00:36.893
I was proud of myself.

1290
01:00:40.532 --> 01:00:41.773
I don't get it.

1291
01:00:43.433 --> 01:00:44.742
I don't get it.

1292
01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.143
I really don't get it.

1293
01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:58.253
I talked too much about myself.

1294
01:00:58.782 --> 01:01:01.393
You seem to have worries yourself.

1295
01:01:01.793 --> 01:01:03.222
Tell me about them.

1296
01:01:03.222 --> 01:01:05.362
I can listen for you.

1297
01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:13.933
But Mister,

1298
01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:18.273
do you not have pants on?

1299
01:01:18.543 --> 01:01:22.713
Mister. When doing to an interview, make sure you put pants on.

1300
01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.842
If you don't, you'll be in big trouble.

1301
01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:28.483
Mister, stop looking ahead. Look at me.

1302
01:01:28.913 --> 01:01:30.922
Look at me. I don't have a blouse on.

1303
01:01:31.552 --> 01:01:33.282
Where on earth is my blouse?

1304
01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:45.063
My eyes are throbbing.

1305
01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:48.233
He sure has a strong fist. Gosh.

1306
01:01:49.503 --> 01:01:50.702
This is so embarrassing.

1307
01:01:50.802 --> 01:01:52.672
Gosh. I must've been crazy.

1308
01:01:52.672 --> 01:01:55.373
Those two jerks are no good.

1309
01:01:55.572 --> 01:01:56.672
Gosh.

1310
01:02:00.913 --> 01:02:02.052
Here you go.

1311
01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:15.663
- Does it hurt a lot? - Yes.

1312
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.733
You shouldn't have done that.

1313
01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.802
I couldn't stand the way that jerk was talking.

1314
01:02:22.032 --> 01:02:23.132
What?

1315
01:02:23.702 --> 01:02:25.103
Then you did that for me?

1316
01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:29.713
For you? It's nothing like that at all.

1317
01:02:30.043 --> 01:02:31.242
Never mind then.

1318
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.813
Anyway, thank you, Dong Gu.

1319
01:02:35.112 --> 01:02:36.253
For what?

1320
01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.422
For letting me stay here.

1321
01:02:41.652 --> 01:02:44.293
Before I came here, I was always lonely.

1322
01:02:45.722 --> 01:02:48.492
But I don't feel that way so much these days.

1323
01:02:49.862 --> 01:02:52.032
I have people that worry about me now.

1324
01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:56.972
I've never had family, so I wouldn't know exactly,

1325
01:02:57.943 --> 01:03:02.072
but if I did have a family, I think this is how it would feel like.

1326
01:03:02.543 --> 01:03:05.143
If you're grateful, try to get you work done well.

1327
01:03:06.112 --> 01:03:07.813
You sure can't stop giving me a hard time.

1328
01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:12.552
Do you think that bruise will actually go away that way?

1329
01:03:12.782 --> 01:03:15.322
- Give it to me. I'll help you. - No. That's okay.

1330
01:03:15.422 --> 01:03:17.193
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

1331
01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.293
I'll be all right.

1332
01:03:18.293 --> 01:03:20.893
- Trust me for once, Dong Gu. - Stop it.

1333
01:03:23.693 --> 01:03:24.802
Oh, dear.

1334
01:03:25.933 --> 01:03:28.632
I told you that I'd do it! Gosh!

1335
01:03:28.802 --> 01:03:31.302
Why can't you do anything right?

1336
01:03:31.302 --> 01:03:34.572
I didn't do it on purpose.

1337
01:03:34.672 --> 01:03:35.813
Look at you now.

1338
01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:37.612
Are you talking back at me now?

1339
01:03:37.943 --> 01:03:41.913
I treated you well and now you're talking back at me?

1340
01:03:42.413 --> 01:03:44.382
This is partly your fault.

1341
01:03:44.483 --> 01:03:45.822
You always give me a hard time.

1342
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.422
Do you think I don't have a temper?

1343
01:03:47.422 --> 01:03:49.893
You sure do scare me. What did I do wrong?

1344
01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:52.163
Let me see that temper of yours. What'll you do?

1345
01:03:52.163 --> 01:03:54.592
What'll you do? What do you intend on doing?

1346
01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:57.032
- I can really get upset you know. - Go right ahead.

1347
01:03:57.032 --> 01:03:58.532
I've been too patient with you, haven't I?

1348
01:03:58.532 --> 01:04:01.773
I wonder what'll happen if you get upset. You know how I am, right?

1349
01:04:01.873 --> 01:04:03.672
You'll really be surprised.

1350
01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:06.103
You'll be even more surprised.

1351
01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:08.012
Why are you so strong?

1352
01:04:08.313 --> 01:04:10.313
Why is your head so hard as a rock?

1353
01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:12.143
Did you say a rock? Are you saying I'm stupid?

1354
01:04:13.443 --> 01:04:15.583
(Thanks you Kim Young Ok, Lee Deok Hwa, and Kim Seo Hyung...)

1355
01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:16.882
(for their special appearances.)

1356
01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:29.233
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1357
01:04:29.393 --> 01:04:30.433
You startled me!

1358
01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.333
I want to give up my dream of becoming a reporter.

1359
01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:35.902
What Seo Jin needs most now is true encouragement.

1360
01:04:35.902 --> 01:04:38.103
If you endure this hard times,

1361
01:04:38.103 --> 01:04:40.512
you'll be sure to earn great results.

1362
01:04:40.512 --> 01:04:42.172
What happened? Why were you brought to the police station?

1363
01:04:42.172 --> 01:04:45.043
Seo Jin. Listen. You did nothing wrong,

1364
01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:46.842
so cheer up!

1365
01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:49.782
Jun Ki. I think I've fallen in love.

1366
01:04:49.782 --> 01:04:51.722
I think she really likes me.

1367
01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:53.083
Du Shik. What were you doing?

1368
01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:54.793
I was watching a movie.

1369
01:04:54.793 --> 01:04:56.092
- Then let's watch it together. - No!

1370
01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.762
Why did I send this to Sun Ah?

1371
01:04:58.023 --> 01:04:59.222
Darn it!

1372
01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.733
You crazy idiot!

1373
01:05:00.733 --> 01:05:03.063
Do you have a girlfriend? What do you think about me?

1374
01:05:03.063 --> 01:05:04.902
She met a new guy.

1375
01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:08.072
I'll make sure I find that jerk and kill him.

1376
01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.302
The swine flu?

1377
01:05:09.302 --> 01:05:11.143
This is all for your mom's sake.

1378
01:05:11.143 --> 01:05:12.742
I worried about your mom.

1379
01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.943
Yoon Ah. Do you know that you can be a nuisance?

1380
01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:16.842
Yoon Ah. I'd like to ask you out on a date.

1381
01:05:16.842 --> 01:05:18.382
- Isn't that Yoon Ah? - Who is that guy?

1382
01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:20.452
Would you like to get kicked out or rather get married?

1383
01:05:20.452 --> 01:05:22.213
- Pardon? A wedding? - A wedding?
