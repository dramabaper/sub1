00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:14.446
(Lee Jae Young)

2
00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:37.137
The autopsy result says...

3
00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.167
it's multiple compound fractions.

4
00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:41.266
The crucial reason is...

5
00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:43.167
the compound fraction of the parietal bone.

6
00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:45.677
Was it due to external shock?

7
00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.947
The victim didn't wear a seat belt.

8
00:00:55.786 --> 00:00:57.716
His neck might have been bent backward as a rebound.

9
00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:01.826
It says his calf muscles were stiff.

10
00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:05.557
It's possible if he was stepping on the brake.

11
00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:11.596
There was nothing to stop the car.

12
00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:14.107
Then what would it be?

13
00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:24.747
Why do you think it's a homicide?

14
00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:26.887
The car was on fire,

15
00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:30.387
but there was no soot in his throat.

16
00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:31.387
Why?

17
00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:34.027
Because he wasn't breathing.

18
00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.626
He might have stopped breathing as he got into the accident.

19
00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:39.926
What if he was dead before the accident?

20
00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:42.527
Well...

21
00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:44.296
It's possible.

22
00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:47.037
You can sense when you see the body if it was an accident or a homicide.

23
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.766
You don't write the autopsy result based on your sense.

24
00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:51.037
You can only write the facts.

25
00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:53.807
Not just ambiguous facts. What's your opinion?

26
00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:55.607
Is it an accident or a homicide?

27
00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:15.727
Jae Young.

28
00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:17.537
Jae Young!

29
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:22.766
Jae Young.

30
00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:33.616
It's homicide, isn't it?

31
00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:36.917
Stop it. I can't answer you.

32
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:51.836
It's unofficial.

33
00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:53.567
I'll only refer to it.

34
00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:59.377
I'm not asking for the result. I want to know your opinion.

35
00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.086
Even though it's a car accident,

36
00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:12.257
it's too perfect.

37
00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:15.486
Also, there's something suspicious.

38
00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:19.296
The bruise on his wrist.

39
00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:27.836
- Bruise? - You could get bruised after dying,

40
00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:31.607
but because the blood circulation has stopped already,

41
00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:34.107
the color or the shape is different than when you're alive.

42
00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:37.947
A physical fight?

43
00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:39.917
Is that it?

44
00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:41.616
I think...

45
00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.717
it was caused just before his death.

46
00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:47.757
It's only a guess.

47
00:03:47.757 --> 00:03:50.157
I have no evidence to jump to conclusions for now.

48
00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:52.996
Thank you.

49
00:03:55.727 --> 00:03:58.597
I never said it's a homicide. Okay?

50
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:04.806
(Lee Jae Young)

51
00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:32.796
How could this happen?

52
00:04:34.506 --> 00:04:36.236
How can one's life...

53
00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:40.907
be so vain?

54
00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:52.186
Let's go back.

55
00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:55.386
You need to take care of yourself.

56
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:07.506
Let's go, Eun Joo.

57
00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:15.977
Yes.

58
00:05:17.477 --> 00:05:18.647
How is it there?

59
00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:21.186
Nothing special for now.

60
00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:25.316
It feels like something is going to happen though.

61
00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:28.357
Is that right?

62
00:05:32.626 --> 00:05:35.227
The autopsy result is quite ambiguous.

63
00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:37.537
(The autopsy result)

64
00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:40.537
This isn't enough for the prosecution to take the case.

65
00:05:40.537 --> 00:05:42.136
The probability is 50-50.

66
00:05:42.306 --> 00:05:44.176
It's 50-percent probable to be an accident,

67
00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.046
but it's also 50-percent probable to be a homicide.

68
00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.876
Then bring something to me.

69
00:05:49.077 --> 00:05:50.917
A variable that can break...

70
00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:52.777
the probability.

71
00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.256
A variable...

72
00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:17.777
(Episode 6: Variable)

73
00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:23.647
- I heard the result is out. - Yes, hello.

74
00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:26.277
It's out,

75
00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:28.417
but it's a bit ambiguous.

76
00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:31.717
Depending on how the police take the case,

77
00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:34.957
they can hand it to the prosecution.

78
00:06:35.957 --> 00:06:38.126
Did you find a new employee?

79
00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:40.667
Well, that's... Actually...

80
00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.926
The unemployment problem is serious,

81
00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:45.436
but job seekers have their own preferences.

82
00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:46.806
They'll be paid so little...

83
00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:49.167
when they have to work from early in the morning to late at night.

84
00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.607
The labor environment in here is that poor.

85
00:06:51.607 --> 00:06:54.077
And even though I'd like to hire them,

86
00:06:54.077 --> 00:06:57.616
they don't seem to have courage to join this cruel reality.

87
00:06:57.676 --> 00:07:00.087
Get things ready so that I can do a final interview tomorrow.

88
00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:01.847
Okay.

89
00:07:02.186 --> 00:07:04.417
Tomorrow? Okay... Tomorrow...

90
00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:08.686
Tomorrow...

91
00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:11.696
Job seekers these days are so picky.

92
00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:13.366
But by tomorrow...

93
00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:17.436
(Resume)

94
00:07:19.537 --> 00:07:23.236
I'm here because I've got this passionate humanism in my heart,

95
00:07:23.506 --> 00:07:25.376
but I don't think others will be like me.

96
00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:27.246
And I have to select them by tomorrow.

97
00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:30.147
(Autopsy records)

98
00:07:33.217 --> 00:07:35.417
(It is the car accident case...)

99
00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:37.587
(that happened on a street at 5am on Thursday, January 18, 2018.)

100
00:08:07.847 --> 00:08:08.847
Drink it.

101
00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:10.717
It'll make you warm.

102
00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:16.256
I'm glad that the funeral went without any issues.

103
00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:18.857
I took care of the fee,

104
00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:20.196
just so you know.

105
00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:23.366
The media will keep their manners for the time being.

106
00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:26.806
I asked my acquaintances for help.

107
00:08:27.267 --> 00:08:30.107
I was a reporter for more than 10 years in this field.

108
00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.347
They won't report about the case for the time being.

109
00:08:34.376 --> 00:08:37.817
You just have to take care of yourself from now on.

110
00:08:38.776 --> 00:08:39.986
And your baby too,

111
00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:41.786
okay?

112
00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:45.886
It's suspicious in some parts...

113
00:08:46.486 --> 00:08:48.457
to close the case.

114
00:08:49.156 --> 00:08:51.197
You don't have evidence for murder.

115
00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:54.396
The autopsy result says so.

116
00:08:54.396 --> 00:08:58.266
Still, it's ambiguous to call it an accident.

117
00:08:59.136 --> 00:09:01.937
Isn't that your opinion?

118
00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:06.577
Why do you want to cover this case so much?

119
00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:10.577
I...

120
00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:16.116
don't want people to talk about my husband anymore.

121
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.526
It's important to keep the deceased's honor.

122
00:09:21.557 --> 00:09:24.357
But what if it wasn't an accident?

123
00:09:25.427 --> 00:09:29.166
Shouldn't you find out for your husband's sake?

124
00:09:29.727 --> 00:09:31.266
No matter what kind of life they lived,

125
00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:34.207
no one's death can be covered evasively.

126
00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:36.307
But...

127
00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:40.177
Go Hye Ran is involved in the scandal.

128
00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:42.077
My husband is dead,

129
00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:44.577
and my friend is being suspected.

130
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.116
People...

131
00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:50.357
want to know what relationship they were in.

132
00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:53.187
Just the fact that he's dead...

133
00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:56.386
is enough...

134
00:09:57.057 --> 00:09:58.797
to make me torn apart.

135
00:10:01.597 --> 00:10:05.236
I don't want to add such a scandal to my suffering.

136
00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:10.776
Do you...

137
00:10:12.437 --> 00:10:14.047
really want to cover it up like this?

138
00:10:17.947 --> 00:10:19.276
Won't you regret it?

139
00:10:20.347 --> 00:10:21.786
Think only of your baby.

140
00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:26.087
From now on, think only of your baby.

141
00:10:27.057 --> 00:10:28.557
You have to survive somehow.

142
00:10:29.756 --> 00:10:30.927
You're a mom.

143
00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:36.097
I...

144
00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:38.967
won't regret it...

145
00:10:41.136 --> 00:10:43.166
for the sake of my baby.

146
00:10:54.847 --> 00:10:56.786
I'm a mom now.

147
00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:00.756
I need to survive somehow.

148
00:11:03.087 --> 00:11:05.197
As soon as things get settled here,

149
00:11:05.927 --> 00:11:07.526
I'll go back to the States.

150
00:11:08.697 --> 00:11:09.967
I think...

151
00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:14.107
it'll be better for me to endure it there than here.

152
00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:19.636
I know an obstetrician there.

153
00:11:20.477 --> 00:11:21.707
I'll put in a word for you.

154
00:11:22.746 --> 00:11:24.177
Thank you.

155
00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:28.386
I feel bad for getting endless help from you.

156
00:11:28.516 --> 00:11:30.957
Tell me whenever you need help.

157
00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:32.886
It's okay.

158
00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:34.727
Okay.

159
00:12:33.077 --> 00:12:35.347
You killed her, murderer.

160
00:12:35.847 --> 00:12:37.786
What kind of lunatic is this?

161
00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:40.827
I have proof that you're the murderer.

162
00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:42.227
(Restricted number)

163
00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:58.236
Until when will you do nothing about Go Hye Ran?

164
00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:07.516
We lost the viewership, but she got it back right away.

165
00:13:07.817 --> 00:13:10.057
The viewership went up by an additional five percent.

166
00:13:11.187 --> 00:13:13.587
Good. Everything is good.

167
00:13:14.557 --> 00:13:16.126
But we're dealing with news,

168
00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:19.057
not best-selling products.

169
00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:21.896
Hye Ran...

170
00:13:22.626 --> 00:13:25.396
led that news up to here.

171
00:13:25.766 --> 00:13:28.307
Only she can increase the viewership...

172
00:13:29.307 --> 00:13:31.177
by 11 percent overnight.

173
00:13:31.636 --> 00:13:34.207
We shouldn't give up on her potential...

174
00:13:34.607 --> 00:13:36.347
so easily like that.

175
00:13:36.347 --> 00:13:38.646
What about the risk that she has?

176
00:13:40.447 --> 00:13:42.317
Do you have a safety net for it?

177
00:13:46.457 --> 00:13:48.327
Excuse me.

178
00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:02.666
It's irresponsible of you to have only Go Hye Ran...

179
00:14:04.036 --> 00:14:05.736
as your card.

180
00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:09.876
You're aware of it, right?

181
00:14:14.886 --> 00:14:15.886
(Painkillers)

182
00:14:37.906 --> 00:14:39.707
You're keeping my life safely, right?

183
00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:41.146
So far, so good.

184
00:14:41.177 --> 00:14:44.177
I heard the autopsy result came out ambiguously.

185
00:14:44.177 --> 00:14:46.347
It's always like that.

186
00:14:46.416 --> 00:14:49.687
They open up possibilities here and there.

187
00:14:50.416 --> 00:14:52.886
It's not enough for them to send the case to the prosecution.

188
00:14:52.886 --> 00:14:54.886
You don't have any other variables?

189
00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:00.967
First off, Eun Joo...

190
00:15:01.666 --> 00:15:04.166
doesn't want the case to be progressed any further.

191
00:15:04.496 --> 00:15:07.666
She must want to stop her husband's death from becoming a gossip.

192
00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:09.707
She plans to leave the country...

193
00:15:09.707 --> 00:15:12.236
as soon as things are settled here. When that happens...

194
00:15:12.406 --> 00:15:15.607
I got an interesting text just now.

195
00:15:16.376 --> 00:15:18.246
- What? - Apparently, there's evidence...

196
00:15:18.246 --> 00:15:19.717
that you're the killer.

197
00:15:19.717 --> 00:15:23.416
The pressure from the vice president is immense.

198
00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.687
If an unexpected variable appears,

199
00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:30.827
it won't be easy for both of us.

200
00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:37.036
It's not the first time receiving a threat while running the news.

201
00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:39.906
I was threatened with terrorism before.

202
00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:42.536
Consider this as one of those cases.

203
00:15:42.536 --> 00:15:45.077
I'd also like to believe that,

204
00:15:46.077 --> 00:15:47.376
but as the person in charge...

205
00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:49.847
Gosh.

206
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.146
It's impossible not to hold a meeting.

207
00:15:55.886 --> 00:15:56.886
Will you...

208
00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:00.357
bring in Han Ji Won?

209
00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:07.396
It's a dilemma.

210
00:16:07.996 --> 00:16:10.797
Detectives insist that it's a homicide.

211
00:16:11.097 --> 00:16:13.437
JBC says that Han Ji Won will come back.

212
00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:17.337
You might lose your position as a spokesperson.

213
00:16:18.406 --> 00:16:21.047
On top of that, you're being threatened? Oh, my.

214
00:16:23.246 --> 00:16:25.246
This is the worst crisis of your life.

215
00:16:30.087 --> 00:16:31.187
You didn't do it,

216
00:16:33.087 --> 00:16:34.156
did you?

217
00:16:40.097 --> 00:16:42.697
If only I had killed him myself...

218
00:16:43.697 --> 00:16:44.866
If you did,

219
00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:48.107
things wouldn't be as messy as now.

220
00:16:48.636 --> 00:16:50.376
You'd be more careful.

221
00:16:50.807 --> 00:16:52.506
You'd also have a definite alibi.

222
00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:55.876
If it had been Go Hye Ran,

223
00:16:56.977 --> 00:16:59.276
the murder would've been simple and clean.

224
00:17:02.347 --> 00:17:04.216
Is there any solution?

225
00:17:08.287 --> 00:17:09.787
You have your husband.

226
00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.327
Tae Wook.

227
00:18:44.087 --> 00:18:45.186
What are you doing?

228
00:18:46.787 --> 00:18:48.527
Let's go back to the US.

229
00:18:49.487 --> 00:18:50.956
The competition is coming up soon.

230
00:18:51.257 --> 00:18:52.497
You need to prepare yourself.

231
00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.027
Give up that competition.

232
00:18:57.267 --> 00:18:59.337
I'm not in the right condition to compete.

233
00:19:10.277 --> 00:19:12.146
Stop drinking.

234
00:19:17.357 --> 00:19:18.987
Stop it.

235
00:19:19.787 --> 00:19:21.686
I'm having a hard time too.

236
00:19:22.426 --> 00:19:25.656
I have to build stamina for a competition that's in a month.

237
00:19:26.696 --> 00:19:28.267
Let me rest, Eun Joo.

238
00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:30.597
Let's skip this competition.

239
00:19:30.997 --> 00:19:33.507
I can do a few commercial shoots for money.

240
00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:36.876
Are you being arrogant?

241
00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:39.876
Don't you know how hard I worked to get here?

242
00:19:41.807 --> 00:19:44.646
I cleaned buildings every day until my hands and feet blistered...

243
00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:46.787
to support you and help you get this far.

244
00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:47.886
What?

245
00:19:48.886 --> 00:19:51.257
It's too hard? You want to rest?

246
00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:52.787
How can you say that?

247
00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:01.166
Are you out of your mind? Stop drinking.

248
00:20:01.797 --> 00:20:03.337
You stop.

249
00:20:04.696 --> 00:20:07.507
I can't live every time you do this!

250
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:09.976
I'm about to suffocate!

251
00:20:10.237 --> 00:20:11.737
Darn it.

252
00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.247
Is that why you slept with someone else?

253
00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:19.777
You promised that you'd never do it again.

254
00:20:19.777 --> 00:20:22.517
You said you would never hurt me again by cheating.

255
00:20:23.017 --> 00:20:25.416
It hasn't been a year since you made that promise.

256
00:20:25.456 --> 00:20:26.487
However,

257
00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:29.186
you had an affair as soon as we came to Korea.

258
00:20:30.456 --> 00:20:33.396
Fine, I can understand about Han Ji Won.

259
00:20:33.896 --> 00:20:35.426
She's young and pretty.

260
00:20:35.896 --> 00:20:38.136
It's possible to lose control.

261
00:20:39.866 --> 00:20:41.507
How could you do that with Hye Ran?

262
00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:46.476
Hye Ran is my friend.

263
00:20:46.777 --> 00:20:49.376
How could you cheat on me with Hye Ran?

264
00:20:50.176 --> 00:20:53.416
How could you do this to me?

265
00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.037
- Hello? - No.

266
00:21:17.706 --> 00:21:18.777
Don't leave.

267
00:21:22.976 --> 00:21:25.446
Let's do that. Okay.

268
00:21:42.997 --> 00:21:44.067
Stop.

269
00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:45.597
Stop right there!

270
00:22:01.616 --> 00:22:03.317
If you leave now,

271
00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:06.017
it's over between us.

272
00:24:08.976 --> 00:24:10.747
Who has it now?

273
00:24:11.577 --> 00:24:12.577
What do you mean?

274
00:24:12.817 --> 00:24:14.487
Go Hye Ran's dash cam memory chip.

275
00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:28.097
It's the determining key to this case.

276
00:24:56.827 --> 00:24:58.656
What are you doing in the dark?

277
00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:03.696
I was just...

278
00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:05.866
thinking.

279
00:25:12.176 --> 00:25:14.547
The autopsy result can't prove anything.

280
00:25:15.077 --> 00:25:16.376
Even if it goes to the prosecutors,

281
00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:19.146
you won't be indicted and remain innocent.

282
00:25:21.216 --> 00:25:22.216
I know.

283
00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:23.456
Then what's the problem?

284
00:25:23.916 --> 00:25:25.386
What are you worried about?

285
00:25:29.087 --> 00:25:30.827
I have too many enemies.

286
00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:33.297
Enemies?

287
00:25:34.527 --> 00:25:36.797
It looks like even those who have nothing to do with the case...

288
00:25:37.966 --> 00:25:40.807
want to use it to bury me for good.

289
00:25:41.136 --> 00:25:44.607
The vice president, Chief Jang, and Dae Woong.

290
00:25:45.107 --> 00:25:47.446
All of them have worked with me...

291
00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:50.676
for almost a decade or longer.

292
00:25:54.716 --> 00:25:56.916
Does this mean that I've lived my life wrong all along?

293
00:26:18.607 --> 00:26:20.547
There are always two groups of people...

294
00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:23.047
who swarm around those who are successful.

295
00:26:23.646 --> 00:26:26.376
The ones who want to benefit from their success...

296
00:26:27.116 --> 00:26:30.156
and the jealous ones who want them to fail.

297
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:33.726
But neither group...

298
00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:36.327
really likes them.

299
00:26:40.196 --> 00:26:43.126
I guess I blew the opportunity to work at the Blue House.

300
00:26:43.767 --> 00:26:45.037
That's not your only opportunity.

301
00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:47.436
There are many other things that you can do.

302
00:26:49.237 --> 00:26:50.436
Do you really think so?

303
00:26:51.577 --> 00:26:54.706
I don't even know when I'll be kicked out of News Nine.

304
00:27:15.097 --> 00:27:16.166
Let's go together.

305
00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:17.966
The president of Kangyool Law Firm will be there too.

306
00:27:20.636 --> 00:27:23.307
(Hanguk University Law School Alumni Association Invitation)

307
00:27:23.307 --> 00:27:25.206
I heard that the vice president of JBC...

308
00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:27.507
is the best friend of Kangyool's president.

309
00:27:27.906 --> 00:27:28.906
And?

310
00:27:30.317 --> 00:27:32.716
We should go and bow to them if we have to.

311
00:27:34.317 --> 00:27:35.416
I'll do anything...

312
00:27:35.916 --> 00:27:39.456
to make sure that you can stay on News Nine.

313
00:27:42.226 --> 00:27:44.126
You'll do that for me?

314
00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:45.726
Well,

315
00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:49.366
it'll be nice if it helps with sorting out this case as well.

316
00:27:49.797 --> 00:27:50.966
Kangyool's president...

317
00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:53.537
has many connections in the prosecution, you know.

318
00:27:55.837 --> 00:27:57.007
Tae Wook.

319
00:27:58.807 --> 00:28:01.706
You used to despise people who did such things.

320
00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:07.247
I'm tired. You should get some rest too.

321
00:29:23.974 --> 00:29:25.675
I'll just pretend that I didn't hear that.

322
00:29:26.504 --> 00:29:29.305
Whether the case is handed over to the prosecution or not,

323
00:29:29.675 --> 00:29:31.714
there won't be any problems because I'm innocent.

324
00:29:32.244 --> 00:29:34.145
And I don't care about those scandalous rumors.

325
00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:36.714
People will forget all about it with time anyway.

326
00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:40.325
Whether I can stay at News Nine or not...

327
00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:43.595
That's also my problem.

328
00:29:44.454 --> 00:29:47.264
I don't need you to get involved.

329
00:29:47.365 --> 00:29:49.694
If you get ousted for no reason,

330
00:29:50.694 --> 00:29:53.305
people's suspicion toward you will get out of control.

331
00:29:53.305 --> 00:29:55.865
If that happens, it'll be my problem to deal with.

332
00:29:55.865 --> 00:29:56.875
No.

333
00:29:59.004 --> 00:30:00.744
It's our problem now, Hye Ran.

334
00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:04.744
When I told you that I'll protect you,

335
00:30:05.974 --> 00:30:08.615
I also meant that I'll protect your honor and social position.

336
00:30:09.214 --> 00:30:10.684
Everything that you have now...

337
00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:12.754
and that you want to gain in the future.

338
00:30:14.425 --> 00:30:15.555
But it goes...

339
00:30:16.925 --> 00:30:19.425
against your principles.

340
00:30:20.425 --> 00:30:23.264
If I can't even protect my wife, such principles...

341
00:30:24.095 --> 00:30:25.194
would be meaningless.

342
00:30:26.194 --> 00:30:27.305
Tae Wook.

343
00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:30.175
For the last five years,

344
00:30:31.974 --> 00:30:34.744
I wasn't exactly a good husband to you.

345
00:30:35.345 --> 00:30:36.875
I want to apologize for what I did...

346
00:30:36.875 --> 00:30:39.214
and make up for everything, so I'll do my very best.

347
00:30:45.184 --> 00:30:46.214
Honey.

348
00:30:49.184 --> 00:30:51.125
You're so mean.

349
00:30:52.425 --> 00:30:53.494
How...

350
00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:56.734
How can you...

351
00:30:57.635 --> 00:30:59.095
make me feel so bad?

352
00:31:10.645 --> 00:31:12.675
I'll make sure no one touches you.

353
00:31:14.244 --> 00:31:16.014
I won't let anyone hurt you.

354
00:31:16.855 --> 00:31:19.055
No matter what happens, I'll make sure...

355
00:31:20.055 --> 00:31:21.325
I keep my promises.

356
00:31:51.954 --> 00:31:53.055
It's okay.

357
00:31:56.184 --> 00:31:58.024
Everything will be okay, Hye Ran.

359
00:34:16.194 --> 00:34:17.194
Here you go.

360
00:34:22.535 --> 00:34:23.675
So...

361
00:34:24.435 --> 00:34:27.144
what kinds of jobs did you have before this?

362
00:34:29.345 --> 00:34:30.444
I stayed...

363
00:34:31.774 --> 00:34:33.444
in prison for 19 years.

364
00:34:36.584 --> 00:34:38.285
Gosh, I'm sorry.

365
00:34:38.814 --> 00:34:40.325
Gosh, it came out of my nose.

366
00:34:42.385 --> 00:34:43.425
It's hot.

367
00:34:43.754 --> 00:34:44.754
Well...

368
00:34:46.124 --> 00:34:48.964
I see. Congratulations.

369
00:34:49.024 --> 00:34:51.435
19 years... That's long.

370
00:34:51.535 --> 00:34:54.705
It's where people live, so it's not a big deal.

371
00:34:54.834 --> 00:34:58.035
It's good not to go, but you already have, so it can't be helped, right?

372
00:34:58.035 --> 00:35:01.175
I'm not saying it's seriously wrong.

373
00:35:04.044 --> 00:35:05.515
So...

374
00:35:06.515 --> 00:35:09.044
Why were you...

375
00:35:10.015 --> 00:35:12.814
in prison for 19 years?

376
00:35:12.814 --> 00:35:13.825
For murder.

For the realization of constitution and justice.

379
00:35:32.935 --> 00:35:35.144
- Cheers. - Cheers.

380
00:35:46.524 --> 00:35:48.055
You can do a good job, right?

381
00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:54.524
Honey, you'll finally get to join the Gold Moon Club.

382
00:35:54.524 --> 00:35:56.294
We don't know how it will turn out yet.

383
00:35:56.294 --> 00:36:00.234
Kangyool's president told you to come to today's gathering himself.

384
00:36:00.834 --> 00:36:03.834
He must want to offer you to be his partner in his law firm.

385
00:36:04.504 --> 00:36:06.444
You should stop being the prosecutor...

386
00:36:06.444 --> 00:36:08.745
and enjoy your life now.

387
00:36:09.575 --> 00:36:12.245
To be honest, you're most talented among your colleagues.

388
00:36:12.914 --> 00:36:14.015
Don't exaggerate.

389
00:36:27.325 --> 00:36:28.394
She's here.

390
00:37:04.095 --> 00:37:06.664
They seem to ignore us.

391
00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:09.564
It's all right. We can ignore them too.

392
00:37:12.305 --> 00:37:14.544
Tae Wook, is that you?

393
00:37:15.444 --> 00:37:18.914
Gosh, it's been such a long time.

394
00:37:19.044 --> 00:37:20.185
Hello, sir.

395
00:37:20.785 --> 00:37:22.615
I can't believe I'm seeing you here.

396
00:37:22.914 --> 00:37:26.785
It was five years ago when you went out to be a public defender.

397
00:37:27.024 --> 00:37:28.754
Have you been well?

398
00:37:28.754 --> 00:37:30.624
It's always the same for me.

399
00:37:30.624 --> 00:37:33.894
I've heard about you from your father from time to time.

400
00:37:36.834 --> 00:37:37.964
She's my wife.

401
00:37:38.394 --> 00:37:40.805
Say hello to the president of Kangyool Law Firm.

402
00:37:41.035 --> 00:37:43.675
It's nice to meet you. I'm Go Hye Ran.

403
00:37:52.374 --> 00:37:53.515
It's nice to meet you.

404
00:37:54.944 --> 00:37:57.385
I enjoy watching your news show.

405
00:38:00.084 --> 00:38:01.084
Thank you.

406
00:38:02.484 --> 00:38:03.894
Let's go over there.

407
00:38:03.894 --> 00:38:05.294
- Yes, sir. - Let's go.

408
00:38:16.635 --> 00:38:20.044
Yeon Jung, what happened to your husband?

409
00:38:20.745 --> 00:38:22.644
Go Hye Ran, that crazy witch.

410
00:38:22.774 --> 00:38:24.515
She should know where to stick her nose in.

411
00:38:26.785 --> 00:38:28.185
- It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

412
00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:30.984
Hello, I'm Kang Tae Wook.

413
00:38:31.555 --> 00:38:32.555
It's nice to meet you.

414
00:38:33.024 --> 00:38:34.124
It's nice to meet you.

415
00:38:34.725 --> 00:38:37.524
- It's time to go. - Okay, let's go.

416
00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:39.124
Let's go together.

417
00:38:39.394 --> 00:38:40.425
Yes, sir.

418
00:39:00.314 --> 00:39:01.544
Gold Moon Club.

419
00:39:03.254 --> 00:39:04.955
It's a club formed by people...

420
00:39:05.484 --> 00:39:08.385
who graduated from the Judicial Research and Training lnstitute...

421
00:39:08.925 --> 00:39:10.694
and the law school of Hanguk University

422
00:39:12.024 --> 00:39:13.894
The keynote of judicial authority and media...

423
00:39:14.024 --> 00:39:16.064
is said to be formed in this club.

424
00:39:16.464 --> 00:39:18.234
It exists for certain,

425
00:39:18.635 --> 00:39:20.035
but it doesn't exist at the same time.

426
00:39:20.265 --> 00:39:22.705
It's a club with absolute power.

427
00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:26.944
Say hello.

428
00:39:27.575 --> 00:39:29.604
He's Congressman Jung Dae Han...

429
00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:31.845
who is a former chief justice...

430
00:39:32.044 --> 00:39:33.745
and the civil administrator of the Blue House.

431
00:39:35.685 --> 00:39:38.414
Hello, I'm Kang Tae Wook.

432
00:39:39.314 --> 00:39:41.854
He's the son of Kang Han Soo, the chief justice.

433
00:39:45.455 --> 00:39:47.164
You're the famous Kang Tae Wook.

434
00:39:47.925 --> 00:39:48.964
It's nice to see you.

435
00:39:49.265 --> 00:39:50.365
It's nice to meet you too.

436
00:39:51.535 --> 00:39:53.234
Well, then. This way.

437
00:39:57.575 --> 00:40:00.805
Say hello to him. He's Vice President Sung Nak Joong.

438
00:40:02.044 --> 00:40:04.874
- Who is he? - He's Attorney Kang Tae Wook.

439
00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:06.644
He's our talented junior.

440
00:40:07.285 --> 00:40:09.515
He's the son of Kang Han Soo, the chief justice.

441
00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:11.385
Oh, goodness.

442
00:40:12.714 --> 00:40:13.754
It's nice to meet you.

443
00:40:14.185 --> 00:40:15.285
It's nice to meet you too.

444
00:40:15.655 --> 00:40:17.124
I've heard a lot about you from my wife.

445
00:40:18.995 --> 00:40:22.225
Anchor Go Hye Ran is his wife.

446
00:40:30.305 --> 00:40:33.374
If your husband can move the club members,

447
00:40:34.345 --> 00:40:35.444
the current situation...

448
00:40:36.745 --> 00:40:37.774
will be over.

449
00:40:41.845 --> 00:40:44.414
He's only a public defender, so how can he?

450
00:40:46.314 --> 00:40:47.825
Rumor says...

451
00:40:48.484 --> 00:40:51.455
that Tae Wook's father is the founding member of that club.

452
00:40:52.394 --> 00:40:53.964
You must be well aware...

453
00:40:54.365 --> 00:40:57.535
how much people in that field care about their own.

454
00:40:58.234 --> 00:40:59.964
If Tae Wook puts his mind to it,

455
00:41:00.905 --> 00:41:03.475
he can easily win them over.

456
00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:08.345
It'll be a piece of cake.

457
00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:18.714
Shouldn't it have been your husband who was supposed to join them today?

458
00:41:20.484 --> 00:41:22.484
You worked so hard...

459
00:41:22.624 --> 00:41:25.024
to make him the member of that club.

460
00:41:25.524 --> 00:41:28.725
I didn't know being the former chief justice's son was this influential.

461
00:41:29.394 --> 00:41:32.664
He isn't just the former chief justice.

462
00:41:35.135 --> 00:41:37.004
Poor, Prosecutor Byeon.

463
00:42:17.115 --> 00:42:19.015
I guess you put some effort on your outfit today.

464
00:42:19.345 --> 00:42:21.714
You look very beautiful, murderer.

465
00:42:37.894 --> 00:42:41.035
Shall I reveal the evidence right here?

466
00:42:41.504 --> 00:42:42.635
It'll be amusing.

467
00:43:04.425 --> 00:43:06.055
You must be worried...

468
00:43:06.624 --> 00:43:08.365
because of your wife.

469
00:43:10.334 --> 00:43:12.234
That's how rumors are.

470
00:43:12.935 --> 00:43:16.374
It's not true, but people involved in it suffer so much.

471
00:43:16.774 --> 00:43:18.705
It's not only the people involved.

472
00:43:19.845 --> 00:43:22.175
The broadcasting station is struggling too.

473
00:43:22.374 --> 00:43:24.314
They're receiving so many texts every day.

474
00:43:25.944 --> 00:43:29.345
A lot of people want us to change the main anchor of the news show.

475
00:43:31.055 --> 00:43:32.185
Public opinions...

476
00:43:32.714 --> 00:43:36.725
can be moved depending on the decision maker's intention.

477
00:43:37.354 --> 00:43:38.354
Don't tell me...

478
00:43:38.925 --> 00:43:41.694
you're here to ask us for help regarding your family business.

479
00:43:49.004 --> 00:43:50.535
When I worked at the Seoul Prosecutors' Office,

480
00:43:51.734 --> 00:43:54.175
your son was charged with drug use.

481
00:43:55.274 --> 00:43:56.274
At that time,

482
00:43:58.475 --> 00:44:01.515
I know you suffered so much...

483
00:44:01.845 --> 00:44:04.155
until your son was released due to lack of evidence.

484
00:44:06.354 --> 00:44:08.655
Gosh, I almost forgot.

485
00:44:09.254 --> 00:44:10.925
You were in charge of...

486
00:44:11.754 --> 00:44:13.265
that case.

487
00:44:17.635 --> 00:44:19.164
It's not a request.

488
00:44:20.604 --> 00:44:22.564
I'm politely asking you for a favor.

489
00:44:22.935 --> 00:44:24.035
Please...

490
00:44:24.834 --> 00:44:26.274
trust and protect Anchor Go Hye Ran.

491
00:45:10.615 --> 00:45:11.714
Let's go, Eun Joo.

492
00:45:26.705 --> 00:45:28.135
Anchor Go Hye Ran's position...

493
00:45:29.205 --> 00:45:30.935
will be safe for now.

494
00:45:32.035 --> 00:45:35.305
Under the assumption that she's innocent, that is.

495
00:45:35.874 --> 00:45:38.144
The autopsy result from the police is ambiguous.

496
00:45:38.774 --> 00:45:42.115
It could be sent to prosecutors depending on the perspective.

497
00:45:44.155 --> 00:45:45.785
What do you want?

498
00:45:46.624 --> 00:45:48.084
I don't want her to be indicted.

499
00:45:49.825 --> 00:45:51.694
There's not enough evidence anyway.

500
00:45:51.694 --> 00:45:53.694
Either way, she won't be indicted...

501
00:45:53.694 --> 00:45:56.095
due to lack of evidence.

502
00:45:57.095 --> 00:45:58.334
Then why are you so persistent?

503
00:45:59.365 --> 00:46:02.464
Are there any unknown variables?

504
00:46:04.905 --> 00:46:07.044
Including all possible variables,

505
00:46:08.544 --> 00:46:10.774
I want to cover up the case as if it never happened.

506
00:46:13.245 --> 00:46:14.745
Could you do it?

507
00:46:56.185 --> 00:46:58.095
You're Lee Jae Young's manager.

508
00:46:58.754 --> 00:46:59.825
Aren't you?

509
00:47:00.794 --> 00:47:02.624
Stop hiding, and come out.

510
00:47:02.865 --> 00:47:05.135
What are you trying to do with me?

511
00:47:43.734 --> 00:47:46.705
Hye Ran, where are you?

512
00:48:16.135 --> 00:48:19.035
(Go Hye Ran is a murderer.)

513
00:48:22.774 --> 00:48:24.144
Did you see who did it?

514
00:48:27.785 --> 00:48:28.785
No.

515
00:48:32.984 --> 00:48:34.024
Hye Ran.

516
00:48:35.925 --> 00:48:38.524
I followed him from the party because he was suspicious,

517
00:48:39.794 --> 00:48:40.894
but I lost him.

518
00:48:41.564 --> 00:48:44.495
I found the car like this when I heard the alarm go off.

519
00:48:45.164 --> 00:48:46.164
Are you...

520
00:48:47.365 --> 00:48:48.734
being threatened?

521
00:48:50.175 --> 00:48:53.075
I didn't want to tell you every detail.

522
00:48:53.805 --> 00:48:56.144
I'm bothering you enough already.

523
00:48:56.745 --> 00:48:57.944
I can...

524
00:48:58.914 --> 00:49:00.484
deal with this much.

525
00:49:01.584 --> 00:49:02.584
It's okay.

526
00:49:13.164 --> 00:49:14.164
It's cold.

527
00:49:15.294 --> 00:49:16.435
Let's go inside.

528
00:49:16.935 --> 00:49:18.595
I won't tolerate it.

529
00:49:19.635 --> 00:49:20.964
Whoever it is...

530
00:49:21.435 --> 00:49:23.874
trying to mess with me like this,

531
00:49:24.604 --> 00:49:26.745
I'll never let it slide.

532
00:49:45.455 --> 00:49:46.925
Could you zoom in?

533
00:49:50.435 --> 00:49:51.865
He's completely covered up.

534
00:49:52.234 --> 00:49:54.135
We can't recognize his face at all.

535
00:49:57.205 --> 00:49:59.234
He had planned it.

536
00:49:59.234 --> 00:50:00.745
He knows where the surveillance cameras are.

537
00:50:00.845 --> 00:50:01.905
Look.

538
00:50:02.144 --> 00:50:03.774
He avoids showing his face.

539
00:50:05.874 --> 00:50:07.345
I think we got something.

540
00:50:16.185 --> 00:50:17.725
Can we see his face again?

541
00:50:26.805 --> 00:50:29.234
(Profile)

542
00:50:29.635 --> 00:50:31.935
He's gone through many hard times.

543
00:50:32.035 --> 00:50:34.175
I couldn't stop myself from pitying him.

544
00:50:35.144 --> 00:50:38.975
Isn't it obvious why he's threatening you?

545
00:50:43.015 --> 00:50:45.515
(5 cases of drunk driving, Theft, Embezzlement)

547
00:50:49.425 --> 00:50:51.894
(He has debts from gambling and took private loans.)

548
00:51:08.475 --> 00:51:10.444
- You're finally here. - Hello.

549
00:51:10.444 --> 00:51:12.374
Did your alumni meeting go well?

550
00:51:12.374 --> 00:51:15.584
Yes, what has the police done since then?

551
00:51:15.584 --> 00:51:17.685
Not much. More importantly,

552
00:51:17.955 --> 00:51:19.854
we have a bigger problem.

553
00:51:21.354 --> 00:51:22.425
A problem?

554
00:51:22.425 --> 00:51:26.194
I made it clear to him,

555
00:51:26.194 --> 00:51:27.325
but...

556
00:51:27.865 --> 00:51:29.024
Listen.

557
00:51:30.694 --> 00:51:33.964
This is a place only for those who believe in justice.

558
00:51:34.164 --> 00:51:35.905
If not, I told him to leave.

559
00:51:35.905 --> 00:51:37.774
His ears must be blocked.

560
00:51:37.774 --> 00:51:39.944
He doesn't understand a word.

561
00:51:39.944 --> 00:51:42.604
He's been coming at the same hour since two days ago.

562
00:51:42.675 --> 00:51:43.745
What should we do?

563
00:51:54.555 --> 00:51:56.725
This isn't worth it, but look at this.

564

(Acceptance Letter for Ha Myung Woo)

566
00:52:10.635 --> 00:52:12.135
Aren't you going to court today?

567
00:52:12.135 --> 00:52:13.705
I'll go before 11am.

568
00:52:13.705 --> 00:52:14.774
It's time to go.

569
00:52:14.774 --> 00:52:16.305
No, it's too early.

570
00:52:16.305 --> 00:52:18.374
Gosh, time flew by.

571
00:52:18.374 --> 00:52:20.345
Okay, I'll see you later then.

572
00:52:20.685 --> 00:52:21.685
Gosh.

573

574
00:52:25.785 --> 00:52:27.825
Attorney... Attorney Kang.

575
00:52:30.024 --> 00:52:31.024
Okay.

576
00:52:32.294 --> 00:52:33.894
I'll be back soon.

577
00:52:51.874 --> 00:52:52.874
Hello.

578
00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:10.135
Hello.

579
00:53:10.635 --> 00:53:13.305
I spoke to you on the phone. I'm Byeon Woo Hyun.

580
00:53:14.205 --> 00:53:16.234
Why did you call me?

581
00:53:16.234 --> 00:53:17.935
Are you in charge of Go Hye Ran's case?

582
00:53:23.245 --> 00:53:25.575
Do you mean Kevin Lee's case?

583
00:53:25.575 --> 00:53:28.414
I heard that the key suspect is Go Hye Ran.

584
00:53:29.714 --> 00:53:31.814
The case interests me.

585
00:53:33.425 --> 00:53:35.124
Could you tell me more about it?

586
00:53:44.535 --> 00:53:46.135
You got accepted into law school.

587
00:53:46.365 --> 00:53:48.064
- Yes. - And you have a criminal record.

588
00:53:48.365 --> 00:53:49.365
Yes.

589
00:53:50.075 --> 00:53:51.234
Was it murder?

590
00:53:54.245 --> 00:53:57.245
I came because you're looking to hire someone who works hard.

591
00:53:57.845 --> 00:53:59.714
And I need a job.

592
00:54:00.845 --> 00:54:03.714
Was it an accidental or intentional murder?

593
00:54:04.854 --> 00:54:06.084
He made the powerless suffer...

594
00:54:06.955 --> 00:54:09.055
just because he was rich.

595
00:54:09.185 --> 00:54:10.825
My friend was the victim.

596
00:54:11.825 --> 00:54:13.794
I had to do something about it.

597
00:54:26.845 --> 00:54:28.104
How far can you go?

598
00:54:30.245 --> 00:54:32.245
How far do you need me to go?

599
00:54:49.225 --> 00:54:50.294
Let's go, Eun Joo.

600
00:55:01.245 --> 00:55:02.374
Will you be able to find him?

601
00:55:04.044 --> 00:55:05.615
He's gone off the grid.

602
00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:09.015
Will he be a variable in the case?

603
00:55:09.444 --> 00:55:12.655
He's one of the people who know the most about Kevin Lee,

604
00:55:13.155 --> 00:55:16.024
and it's highly likely that he knows something about the case.

605
00:55:16.394 --> 00:55:19.354
He seemed very nervous when we questioned him as a witness,

606
00:55:19.694 --> 00:55:21.694
and he totally disappeared after the funeral.

607
00:55:22.325 --> 00:55:23.865
We're trying to track him down at the moment.

608
00:55:25.435 --> 00:55:27.935
Go Hye Ran's dash cam memory card is gone,

609
00:55:28.104 --> 00:55:30.475
and Lee Jae Young's manager has fallen off the face of the earth.

610
00:55:38.044 --> 00:55:40.115
Do you think you can bring me one of the two?

611
00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:42.314
If you can,

612
00:55:42.745 --> 00:55:45.314
I'll probably be able to come up with something.

613
00:56:28.722 --> 00:56:29.992
Dong Hyun.

614
00:56:51.282 --> 00:56:52.882
Can we talk for a minute?

615
00:56:54.452 --> 00:56:56.882
Where would be good? Here or outside?

616
00:57:32.452 --> 00:57:33.523
Shall I teach you a lesson?

617
00:57:33.893 --> 00:57:37.322
Hey, what are you doing here? Answer me!

618
00:57:40.793 --> 00:57:41.963
Baek Dong Hyun.

619
00:57:42.293 --> 00:57:45.532
Age 29. Kevin Lee's former manager. And you're unemployed now.

620
00:57:45.833 --> 00:57:48.333
You've been caught for DUI without a license for five times.

621
00:57:48.503 --> 00:57:50.842
You've been to a patrol station for a dine and dash two months ago,

622
00:57:50.842 --> 00:57:52.103
but Lee Jae Young got you out.

623
00:57:52.572 --> 00:57:54.673
You even started embezzling the company funds recently.

624
00:57:55.072 --> 00:57:56.682
You've lost tens of thousands of dollars on horse racing.

625
00:57:56.943 --> 00:57:59.112
But with Lee Jae Young dead now, nobody is there to cover it for you.

626
00:58:01.083 --> 00:58:02.452
You've already dug up dirt on me?

627
00:58:02.452 --> 00:58:04.322
You must be anxious and desperate.

628
00:58:05.722 --> 00:58:08.153
You have a private loan to pay off, but no one has your back anymore.

629
00:58:08.592 --> 00:58:10.293
Your sister is the only family you have,

630
00:58:10.293 --> 00:58:12.492
but she needs dialysis once every two days.

631
00:58:13.092 --> 00:58:16.362
You sent me the threatening texts because you're desperate for money.

632
00:58:18.262 --> 00:58:19.972
You sure live up to your reputation.

633
00:58:20.802 --> 00:58:22.932
Jae Young said that I shouldn't underestimate you.

634
00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.103
Does your sister know too?

635
00:58:24.543 --> 00:58:27.112
The fact that you're embezzling the company funds and threatening me...

636
00:58:27.543 --> 00:58:29.682
- to pay her hospital bills. - Shut your mouth.

637
00:58:29.682 --> 00:58:32.543
- Time's ticking, but there's no... - I told you to shut your mouth.

638
00:58:32.543 --> 00:58:36.153
You're standing on the edge of a cliff and can't even breathe.

639
00:58:36.213 --> 00:58:39.083
"Why must I live like this?" You must resent the world.

640
00:58:39.083 --> 00:58:40.322
You little...

641
00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:43.193
You wench...

642
00:58:46.193 --> 00:58:47.893
Shoot.

643
00:58:49.193 --> 00:58:50.702
When you're cornered,

644
00:58:50.702 --> 00:58:53.132
you can't really judge what's right or what you should be doing.

645
00:58:53.603 --> 00:58:55.673
That's probably how you're feeling now. But you know what?

646
00:58:56.003 --> 00:58:57.572
You can't live your life like that.

647
00:58:58.802 --> 00:59:02.842
What you're doing now will eventually bog you down.

648
00:59:03.713 --> 00:59:04.943
Don't be ridiculous.

649
00:59:05.313 --> 00:59:09.653
Hey, know your place. You're in no position to lecture me now.

650
00:59:09.923 --> 00:59:11.782
You've even killed a person.

651
00:59:15.452 --> 00:59:16.923
Who told you that I killed him?

652
00:59:17.992 --> 00:59:19.693
Did Jae Young show up as a ghost and tell you that?

653
00:59:19.793 --> 00:59:20.893
That night...

654
00:59:21.833 --> 00:59:24.463
I know that you met up with him that night.

655
00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:27.702
I saw everything in the parking lot.

656
00:59:28.432 --> 00:59:29.472
So?

657
00:59:30.842 --> 00:59:33.213
What can you prove with that statement alone?

658
00:59:33.213 --> 00:59:34.543
I may not be able to prove anything,

659
00:59:35.412 --> 00:59:36.842
but I can make sure you suffer.

660
00:59:39.813 --> 00:59:41.952
I have the original photos from Thailand.

661
00:59:48.092 --> 00:59:50.623
I'm sorry, but you can't put me behind bars with them.

662
00:59:51.523 --> 00:59:54.592
But I can get you arrested for blackmailing me.

663
00:59:54.592 --> 00:59:55.632
Is that so?

664
00:59:56.662 --> 00:59:58.103
Then bring it on.

665
00:59:58.932 --> 01:00:00.903
We'll take this all the way to the end.

666
01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.003
What about your sister though?

667
01:00:09.912 --> 01:00:12.112
Will you let her die just to make me suffer?

668
01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:14.552
Do you really want to be taught a lesson?

669
01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:21.923
Gosh.

670
01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.963
I've paid off her overdue hospital bills.

671
01:00:28.693 --> 01:00:30.903
- What? - I've also put her name...

672
01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:32.362
at the top of the kidney transplant waitlist.

673
01:00:32.432 --> 01:00:34.072
I'll pay for the surgery as well.

674
01:00:34.103 --> 01:00:35.802
What on earth are you trying to do here?

675
01:00:42.443 --> 01:00:44.443
Bring the original photos.

676
01:00:45.282 --> 01:00:47.253
It'd be wise for you not to play with them.

677
01:00:50.552 --> 01:00:53.423
- You want to make a deal with me? - I'm giving you a chance.

678
01:00:53.992 --> 01:00:56.523
A chance to be a decent brother to your sister.

679
01:01:19.713 --> 01:01:21.153
Yes, it's me.

680
01:01:22.182 --> 01:01:23.182
I'm heading back now.

681
01:03:50.532 --> 01:03:51.802
Something's not right.

682
01:03:51.802 --> 01:03:54.103
It doesn't make sense.

683
01:03:54.103 --> 01:03:55.702
- Hello. - I know.

684
01:03:56.373 --> 01:03:57.903
- Hey. - Hello.

685
01:03:57.903 --> 01:03:59.543
- Han Ji Won. - Han Ji Won.

686
01:04:02.813 --> 01:04:03.912
Hello.

687
01:04:03.912 --> 01:04:05.483
What's going on?

688
01:04:05.483 --> 01:04:06.552
Hello.

689
01:04:06.682 --> 01:04:08.213
I'm back.

690
01:04:08.213 --> 01:04:11.853
Now that you're here, the air feels fresh.

691
01:04:11.853 --> 01:04:13.452
Are you an air purifier or what?

692
01:04:13.452 --> 01:04:15.853
One person makes a big change.

693
01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:19.063
Fine dust in the news station is gone.

694
01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:20.262
Anyway, good to have you back.

695
01:04:31.443 --> 01:04:32.873
Eun Joo. What's up?

696
01:04:35.443 --> 01:04:36.443
Today?

697
01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:44.983
I think I'll be free at around 5pm.

698
01:04:47.693 --> 01:04:48.793
Okay.

699
01:04:50.063 --> 01:04:51.162
I'll see you there.

700
01:05:59.362 --> 01:06:00.893
What's up?

701
01:06:08.072 --> 01:06:10.103
I want to set a date for departure,

702
01:06:10.302 --> 01:06:12.503
but there are so many things to take care of.

703
01:06:12.503 --> 01:06:13.742
And the house too.

704
01:06:14.673 --> 01:06:15.813
I know.

705
01:06:17.082 --> 01:06:19.783
Do you want me to introduce you an expert?

706
01:06:21.313 --> 01:06:23.453
It's not easy to handle it alone.

707
01:06:23.582 --> 01:06:25.283
Leave it to an expert...

708
01:06:25.283 --> 01:06:26.283
No.

709
01:06:27.953 --> 01:06:30.193
I don't think that's right, Hye Ran.

710
01:06:31.622 --> 01:06:35.233
It's the first house I lived with him.

711
01:06:36.163 --> 01:06:38.363
I don't want to...

712
01:06:39.163 --> 01:06:40.932
sell it so hastily.

713
01:06:44.972 --> 01:06:46.573
So I think...

714
01:06:48.943 --> 01:06:52.143
I'm going to put off leaving for the US.

715
01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.653
I can't...

716
01:06:54.653 --> 01:06:57.853
leave everything to you and go to the States alone.

717
01:06:58.823 --> 01:07:00.823
I'm going to stay in Seoul for a while...

718
01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:03.222
and take care of...

719
01:07:04.193 --> 01:07:06.193
everything by myself.

720
01:07:08.693 --> 01:07:09.703
What?

721
01:07:10.363 --> 01:07:12.663
About Jae Young...

722
01:07:13.603 --> 01:07:14.632
and you too.

723
01:07:16.203 --> 01:07:17.603
What do you mean?

724
01:07:18.342 --> 01:07:19.443
Me?

725
01:07:20.342 --> 01:07:22.542
I heard you're not done with the police yet.

726
01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.113
Regarding my husband's accident.

727
01:07:24.613 --> 01:07:27.613
- Eun Joo. - I realized...

728
01:07:27.983 --> 01:07:31.323
what friendship means while going through the incident.

729
01:07:33.453 --> 01:07:35.122
It's my turn now.

730
01:07:36.363 --> 01:07:37.993
I want to...

731
01:07:38.893 --> 01:07:41.462
return all the favors you did for me.

732
01:08:08.092 --> 01:08:09.393
I'm sorry I'm late.

733
01:08:20.733 --> 01:08:22.302
I want to...

734
01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:24.872
return all the favors you did for me.

735
01:08:27.943 --> 01:08:29.472
You can look forward to it, Hye Ran.

736
01:09:03.212 --> 01:09:05.682
(Misty)

737
01:09:06.382 --> 01:09:08.953
Hwanil Steel filed for penalty litigation.

738
01:09:08.953 --> 01:09:11.752
I was wondering if you could be my lawyer, Tae Wook.

739
01:09:11.752 --> 01:09:14.292
Do you find me uncomfortable?

740
01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:16.962
What's going on between you two?

741
01:09:16.962 --> 01:09:19.663
- Baek Dong Hyun. Get him. - Hey, Baek Dong Hyun.

742
01:09:22.132 --> 01:09:23.262
Call me before tomorrow.

743
01:09:23.262 --> 01:09:25.103
Find out what he has.

744
01:09:25.103 --> 01:09:28.033
Let's see what cards you have.

745
01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:30.573
Did Hye Ran tell you about her past?

746
01:09:30.643 --> 01:09:33.813
Of course. How typical of her.

747
01:09:33.813 --> 01:09:35.542
What's this music?

748
01:09:35.542 --> 01:09:38.783
It's Hye Ran's favorite song when she was in high school.

749
01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:39.953
Don't play it in the house.

750
01:09:39.953 --> 01:09:41.252
This is getting funny.

751
01:09:41.252 --> 01:09:44.622
Who's she waiting for in this crowded area?
