1
00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:14.104
Seo Jin, please wake up.

2
00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:16.834
You haven't eaten anything for days.

3
00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:17.904
Seriously.

4
00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:19.244
It wasn't the first time you failed a job interview.

5
00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:20.843
How long are you going to act like this?

6
00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.044
Don't bother me anymore. Please get out of my room.

7
00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:24.284
Stop being a brat.

8
00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:26.713
Why did you slap the interviewer's face with pork ribs then?

9
00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:28.413
She said he sexually harassed her.

10
00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:30.983
But how could you actually slap his face though?

11
00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:32.584
And she did it with a chunk of meat!

12
00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:34.753
It's her temper.

13
00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:35.793
Stop it!

14
00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:38.124
Oh, my goodness. Why are you shouting at me?

15
00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:41.064
Seo Jin, you should really shave.

16
00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:43.564
What are you going to do if our guests see you now?

17
00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.573
Are you crying?

18
00:00:49.774 --> 00:00:52.704
Do you have any idea how much I wanted to work at that company?

19
00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:56.844
That's where I've been wanting to go since I decided to be a journalist.

20
00:00:57.484 --> 00:01:00.083
How can you be so harsh on me when I need someone to cheer me up?

21
00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:02.583
I... I mean...

22
00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:04.113
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:07.184
Please stop crying. You'll get that job next time.

24
00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:08.253
Forget about it.

25
00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:10.053
Who's going to hire me...

26
00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:12.893
when I'm cranky and have such a temper?

27
00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:15.064
Forget about the journalist and even getting a job.

28
00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.393
I'm giving up everything.

29
00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:18.704
Giving up?

30
00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:20.603
Kang Seo Jin!

31
00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:23.374
Do you think it makes sense to give up your dream like this?

32
00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.404
That's so petty. The Kangs don't...

33
00:01:26.404 --> 00:01:27.643
I'm that stupid!

34
00:01:27.643 --> 00:01:29.374
That's why I'm giving up!

35
00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:36.814
I just said one thing.

36
00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:38.184
Man, what on earth were you thinking?

37
00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:40.424
Read the air!

38
00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:42.154
- Is it difficult to do that? - Why did you say that?

39
00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:43.154
- What? - Why did you do that?

40
00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:44.464
- I didn't... - Seo Jin,

41
00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:46.223
please eat. You can sleep again after that.

42
00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:49.264
- I don't want it. - Seo Jin...

43
00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:50.333
("Mock Test for Becoming a Journalist")

44
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.264
("There's Nothing Wrong with You!")

45
00:01:54.374 --> 00:01:57.103
How's Seo Jin? Did she eat anything?

46
00:01:57.234 --> 00:02:00.844
No. She's just crying in her room.

47
00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:02.514
That's really bad.

48
00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:04.913
What can I do to make Seo Jin to feel better?

49
00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:09.513
Seo Jin loves chicken feet. Should we go have it for dinner?

50
00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:12.323
Do you really think she'll feel better with that?

51
00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:14.823
What she needs now isn't chicken feet.

52
00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:16.624
She needs our sincere emotional support.

53
00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:17.793
Emotional support?

54
00:02:17.793 --> 00:02:19.693
Like, "Pain is a blessing for the youth"?

55
00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:22.763
It's too cringe to say such things.

56
00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:24.964
Don't you agree, Yoon Ah?

57
00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:36.473
How much does it cost to run a place like this?

58
00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:38.114
It costs a lot.

59
00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:39.543
Why? Do you want to have a bakery?

60
00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:42.753
Do you want to be a pastry chef? What a huge dream!

61
00:02:42.753 --> 00:02:43.913
What did I say?

62
00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.453
I was just talking to myself. Am I not allowed to do that?

63
00:02:46.584 --> 00:02:49.394
You are really bad at reading the air.

64
00:02:49.923 --> 00:02:50.994
Why did I do?

65
00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:52.763
I just said one thing.

66
00:02:53.763 --> 00:02:56.094
- Why are you so upset at me? - When did I get upset?

67
00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:58.203
I've never been upset in my life.

68
00:02:58.203 --> 00:02:59.864
You are upset now.

69
00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:01.503
When? When did I get upset?

70
00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:03.374
What you are doing now is showing how upset you are.

71
00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:05.103
Do you not understand what I'm talking about?

72
00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.114
What are you guys doing here?

73
00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:10.814
Are you guys having a lover's argument?

74
00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:12.244
What kind of nonsense is that?

75
00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:13.614
What is that car by the way?

76
00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:15.714
I'll be in a drama soon.

77
00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:17.624
So I bought one.

78
00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:20.323
It's not even a big role. Why did you buy a car?

79
00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:22.094
Stop talking and just get in the car. It's cold outside.

80
00:03:22.094 --> 00:03:23.394
I'll give you a ride to home.

81
00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:24.994
Fine.

82
00:03:26.223 --> 00:03:28.494
Rebecca

83
00:03:31.404 --> 00:03:32.434
Welcome.

84
00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:35.304
How old is this car? Does this thing work?

85
00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:36.304
Of course.

86
00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:38.943
Rebecca is a great car despite how she looks.

87
00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:41.973
Here we go!

88
00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:47.714
Rebecca?

89
00:03:48.013 --> 00:03:50.614
What happened? Did the engine stop working?

90
00:03:50.714 --> 00:03:52.383
It's okay.

91
00:03:52.383 --> 00:03:54.723
I can start the engine again.

92
00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:03.193
- What is going on? - It's okay.

93
00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:06.003
- I can always stitch that up again. - But...

94
00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:11.644
It's totally fine.

95
00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:14.003
What on earth is fine? I'm getting off now.

96
00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:16.614
What is this? The door's not working.

97
00:04:16.614 --> 00:04:18.584
You can't open it from the inside. It only works from the outside.

98
00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:19.844
What?

99
00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.113
It's okay!

100
00:04:22.113 --> 00:04:24.623
I can go out and open it for you.

101
00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:25.654
It's not okay!

102
00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:27.324
Hey! Rebecca isn't...

103
00:04:27.594 --> 00:04:30.194
The door is broken and... What? Why is it open now?

104
00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:31.964
Leave Rebecca alone.

105
00:04:31.964 --> 00:04:33.123
I can look at the inside of this car from here.

106
00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:35.264
Rebecca is a transparent friend.

107
00:04:35.264 --> 00:04:37.063
Is this a puzzle or what?

108
00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:38.063
The engine works now!

109
00:04:38.303 --> 00:04:40.933
We are leaving shortly!

110
00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:49.873
Rebecca

111
00:04:49.944 --> 00:04:53.043
My Rebecca

112
00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:58.324
- What's going on with Dong Gu? - I almost died.

113
00:04:58.784 --> 00:05:01.293
I'll never get in Rebecca or whatever that was.

114
00:05:01.293 --> 00:05:03.754
How can you call yourself a man when you're such a coward?

115
00:05:03.954 --> 00:05:05.663
You are okay.

116
00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:06.694
Stop that.

117
00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:09.094
Du Shik, let me take Sol. Thanks for taking care of her.

118
00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:10.134
Mommy's back!

119
00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:12.933
Sol, I missed you! I really did!

120
00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:14.303
I missed you too.

121
00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:16.774
What are you doing?

122
00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:18.204
("President Is Bruce Lee")

123
00:05:18.204 --> 00:05:20.373
You are manipulating the number of hits again.

124
00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:21.743
Everyone else does this.

125
00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:25.113
Why isn't it going up these days? This is annoying.

126
00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:26.844
Because it's not fun to read.

127
00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:28.683
Why is it not fun?

128
00:05:28.884 --> 00:05:30.884
Du Shik's good at writing.

129
00:05:31.024 --> 00:05:33.084
Is he?

130
00:05:33.084 --> 00:05:34.694
You haven't read his Internet novel, right?

131
00:05:35.024 --> 00:05:36.024
Right.

132
00:05:36.194 --> 00:05:38.524
The president gets kidnapped by aliens.

133
00:05:38.524 --> 00:05:40.394
But somehow, the president shoots the palm blast to the aliens,

134
00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:41.733
and kills them all.

135
00:05:41.764 --> 00:05:43.293
Do you know who the president is?

136
00:05:44.634 --> 00:05:45.803
He's the president of the United States.

137
00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:49.004
It has an elaborate backstory that Bruce Lee reincarnated...

138
00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:50.103
as the president of the US.

139
00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:51.274
Look at that.

140
00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:53.344
Does it make sense that Bruce Lee shoots a palm blast?

141
00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:54.774
Right. Look down on me like that.

142
00:05:54.873 --> 00:05:56.274
If I ever succeed,

143
00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:58.313
you'll never be part of my work.

144
00:05:58.313 --> 00:05:59.413
Thank you!

145
00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:00.813
Move!

146
00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:02.954
- Du Shik. - Gosh, he's so sensitive.

147
00:06:02.954 --> 00:06:05.723
- Are you offended again? - Stop it.

148
00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:08.254
What's this book?

149
00:06:09.324 --> 00:06:11.123
"Cheer Up, Youth,"

150
00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:14.894
"Failure is not Falling but Staying Down".

151
00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:18.334
They're just empty words.

152
00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:19.464
It makes me cringe.

153
00:06:19.663 --> 00:06:21.534
What a cringe-worthy title.

154
00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:24.274
Do they think those words will cheer anyone up?

155
00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:25.873
Exactly.

156
00:06:26.373 --> 00:06:28.944
I'm so hungry. I'll make some ramyeon.

157
00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:31.284
- I want some too. - I'll make two then.

158
00:06:31.813 --> 00:06:32.913
Gosh.

159
00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:39.154
- Hey. - Seo Jin.

160
00:06:39.353 --> 00:06:40.423
Hey.

161
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.194
- Seo Jin. - Seo Jin.

162
00:06:45.324 --> 00:06:48.293
How long is she going to stay that way?

163
00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:51.964
I don't know. I'm worried that something will happen.

164
00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:57.173
Yoon Ah, can't you take Seo Jin out?

165
00:06:57.173 --> 00:06:59.873
Get some fresh air and comfort her.

166
00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:01.644
Me?

167
00:07:01.913 --> 00:07:04.913
You said what Seo Jin needs the most right now is...

168
00:07:04.913 --> 00:07:07.243
our sincere emotional support.

169
00:07:07.584 --> 00:07:09.084
Please do me this favor.

170
00:07:10.353 --> 00:07:12.524
All right. I'll try.

171
00:07:12.524 --> 00:07:13.623
Okay.

172
00:07:13.923 --> 00:07:15.094
Wait and see.

173
00:07:15.194 --> 00:07:18.623
I'll show you I can succeed. Lee Jun Ki!

174
00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:22.863
Hey. Didn't I tell you to focus on your job?

175
00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:24.264
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:28.204
If you have time for this, put this in my washing machine.

177
00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:32.504
The passcode is 8914, okay?

178
00:07:32.603 --> 00:07:34.673
Fine. Let go of me.

179
00:07:36.243 --> 00:07:38.084
When is the new part-timer coming?

180
00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:41.454
I just found someone. Stop complaining.

181
00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:45.053
Here she comes.

182
00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:55.964
Meet your new colleague. Her name is Kim Sun Woo.

183
00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:58.334
- She's my daughter. - What?

184
00:07:58.663 --> 00:07:59.803
Why are you so surprised?

185
00:08:00.634 --> 00:08:01.733
Hi.

186
00:08:01.733 --> 00:08:04.243
Be nice to her...

187
00:08:04.644 --> 00:08:06.603
and teach her a lot, okay?

188
00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:08.074
Okay, Father.

189
00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:09.673
- What? - What?

190
00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:13.084
- What? I didn't say anything. - That's strange.

191
00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:14.313
Dad.

192
00:08:14.313 --> 00:08:16.784
We have to work. Go now.

193
00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:22.053
My dad is giving you a hard time, right?

194
00:08:22.123 --> 00:08:23.524
He's a bit picky.

195
00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:24.563
Not at all.

196
00:08:24.563 --> 00:08:25.993
Don't be so polite.

197
00:08:25.993 --> 00:08:27.394
I'm a lot younger than you.

198
00:08:27.394 --> 00:08:29.264
All right.

199
00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:31.704
By the way, what do you do?

200
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:35.974
Well, I'm a writer. Or rather, I'm trying to be one.

201
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.703
That's so cool.

202
00:08:37.843 --> 00:08:39.173
What kind of stuff do you write?

203
00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:40.343
Scenarios.

204
00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:45.943
My dream is to write a love story like "Love Letter"...

205
00:08:46.114 --> 00:08:47.313
by Shunji Iwai.

206
00:08:47.313 --> 00:08:49.053
I love that movie.

207
00:08:49.183 --> 00:08:52.183
When you're done, please let me be the first person to read it.

208
00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:53.423
Sure.

209
00:08:53.484 --> 00:08:54.593
It's a promise.

210
00:08:58.693 --> 00:09:00.124
Okay, honey.

211
00:09:00.563 --> 00:09:01.764
- What? - What?

212
00:09:01.864 --> 00:09:04.333
I didn't say anything. I didn't.

213
00:09:04.703 --> 00:09:06.303
Baby shark

214
00:09:07.474 --> 00:09:08.573
Is so cute

215
00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:10.573
He lives in the sea

216
00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:14.043
How many times have we watched this?

217
00:09:14.443 --> 00:09:15.943
I'm sick of this song.

218
00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:18.813
I hate sharks now.

219
00:09:20.014 --> 00:09:22.754
It's time for UFC.

220
00:09:23.614 --> 00:09:24.784
Should we try changing the channel?

221
00:09:24.884 --> 00:09:25.984
Sure.

222
00:09:26.224 --> 00:09:27.323
Under the sea

223
00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:29.494
Daddy shark

224
00:09:29.823 --> 00:09:31.494
Grandma shark

225
00:09:32.524 --> 00:09:33.724
She's very caring

226
00:09:34.593 --> 00:09:35.764
Under the sea

227
00:09:37.063 --> 00:09:40.004
Fine. Watch it for the rest of your life.

228
00:09:40.404 --> 00:09:42.004
Gosh.

229
00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:44.004
My goodness.

230
00:09:45.144 --> 00:09:46.374
Grandpa shark

231
00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:47.974
We are

232
00:09:48.144 --> 00:09:49.244
What's that sound?

233
00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:51.313
What is it?

234
00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:53.514
Where is it coming from?

235
00:10:05.323 --> 00:10:08.963
Is this the sound of your heart beating?

236
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.534
Guys, I think...

237
00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:13.604
I'm in love.

238
00:10:15.433 --> 00:10:17.703
There he goes again.

239
00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:20.073
Who is it this time?

240
00:10:20.744 --> 00:10:23.043
Well, she's my boss's daughter.

241
00:10:23.043 --> 00:10:24.744
She's so cute and sweet.

242
00:10:24.744 --> 00:10:25.843
I don't care.

243
00:10:26.014 --> 00:10:28.014
Didn't I tell you?

244
00:10:28.254 --> 00:10:32.384
The cuter and prettier the girl is, the lower chance you have.

245
00:10:33.183 --> 00:10:34.724
Wake up.

246
00:10:34.724 --> 00:10:35.793
It's different this time.

247
00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:38.024
She seems very interested in me.

248
00:10:40.624 --> 00:10:42.333
Hello. Yes.

249
00:10:43.463 --> 00:10:44.604
A film company?

250
00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:51.303
All right.

251
00:10:51.774 --> 00:10:54.774
I'm the director of Artist Top Film,

252
00:10:55.213 --> 00:10:56.343
Tak Myung Hwan.

253
00:10:56.343 --> 00:10:57.514
I see.

254
00:10:58.384 --> 00:11:01.553
I enjoyed reading your Internet novel.

255
00:11:02.213 --> 00:11:03.284
I see.

256
00:11:03.384 --> 00:11:05.854
Was it that interesting?

257
00:11:05.854 --> 00:11:08.593
No. It was a piece of rubbish.

258
00:11:10.024 --> 00:11:11.923
- Then why... - But...

259
00:11:12.293 --> 00:11:15.193
I'd like to talk about the bed scene on page 4 of the 7th episode...

260
00:11:15.193 --> 00:11:18.604
of your novel, "President Is Bruce Lee".

261
00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:22.173
If I may, I'd like to call you an erotic genius.

262
00:11:22.173 --> 00:11:23.803
You're the incarnation of eroticism.

263
00:11:24.744 --> 00:11:26.244
Let me get to the point.

264
00:11:26.443 --> 00:11:28.614
I'd like you to write a scenario for me.

265
00:11:28.614 --> 00:11:30.843
What? A scenario?

266
00:11:31.913 --> 00:11:33.284
- Like what? - Have you heard of ...

267
00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.813
the "Goodbye Sister-in-law" series?

268
00:11:35.813 --> 00:11:38.083
I'm afraid I haven't. What is it about?

269
00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:41.754
It's an erotic movie about a man who loves his sister-in-law.

270
00:11:42.053 --> 00:11:44.364
"Goodbye Sister-in-law 5"...

271
00:11:44.864 --> 00:11:46.293
What do you take me for?

272
00:11:46.293 --> 00:11:47.864
I don't write stuff like that.

273
00:11:48.034 --> 00:11:51.264
Paul Verhoeven, Ang Lee, and Stanley Kubrick.

274
00:11:51.534 --> 00:11:54.303
- Do you recognize these names? - Yes, I do.

275
00:11:54.303 --> 00:11:57.134
Then you must know about their movies, "Basic Instinct",

276
00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:59.474
"Lust, Caution", and "Eyes Wide Shut" too.

277
00:11:59.843 --> 00:12:03.943
I'm not planning to make just an ordinary erotic movie.

278
00:12:04.943 --> 00:12:08.854
Would you like to create an international masterpiece with me?

279
00:12:09.683 --> 00:12:12.484
We'll go to Cannes together.

280
00:12:13.154 --> 00:12:14.293
What do you say?

281
00:12:33.644 --> 00:12:36.313
Seo Jin, it's so nice to be outside, isn't it?

282
00:12:36.474 --> 00:12:38.583
Isn't it so refreshing?

283
00:12:40.144 --> 00:12:41.384
Not at all.

284
00:12:41.384 --> 00:12:43.384
I'm freezing.

285
00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:46.254
Yoon Ah, I'm so cold. Let's go home now.

286
00:12:46.553 --> 00:12:50.354
Hold on. I have something I really want to tell you.

287
00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:51.463
What is it?

288
00:12:51.963 --> 00:12:54.024
Hurry. I'm freezing.

289
00:12:55.364 --> 00:12:56.433
Seo Jin.

290
00:12:57.933 --> 00:12:59.904
Failure is not falling down...

291
00:13:00.303 --> 00:13:02.034
but staying down.

292
00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:03.534
What?

293
00:13:06.104 --> 00:13:07.303
Do you see that kid?

294
00:13:08.313 --> 00:13:10.543
Trying to fly that kite,

295
00:13:10.543 --> 00:13:12.384
he fell so many times.

296
00:13:12.683 --> 00:13:15.083
But he never gave up.

297
00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:17.683
In the end, he succeeded.

298
00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:20.754
- And? - Just like that kid,

299
00:13:20.953 --> 00:13:23.793
even if you fall down, if you keep getting back up,

300
00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:28.193
you'll be able to fly like that kite someday.

301
00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:34.063
My gosh. Look how high that kite is flying.

302
00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:36.634
What are you talking about? I'm freezing here.

303
00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:38.803
Seo Jin, are you serious?

304
00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:40.874
Fine. I'll look.

305
00:13:41.443 --> 00:13:42.874
Why are you making me look at it?

306
00:13:44.683 --> 00:13:46.014
My goodness. Seo Jin!

307
00:13:46.484 --> 00:13:48.284
Gosh. Are you okay?

308
00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:50.083
Seo Jin, are you all right?

309
00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:52.254
- I'm bleeding. - You're bleeding?

310
00:13:52.254 --> 00:13:54.083
- Gosh. - What should I do?

311
00:13:57.463 --> 00:13:59.024
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

312
00:13:59.124 --> 00:14:00.593
Open the door, will you?

313
00:14:00.693 --> 00:14:02.093
Seo Jin.

314
00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:04.333
Forget it! Leave me alone!

315
00:14:05.963 --> 00:14:07.573
I told you to comfort her.

316
00:14:07.573 --> 00:14:10.234
Why did you make her look at a kite?

317
00:14:10.234 --> 00:14:12.173
I didn't know this would happen.

318
00:14:12.474 --> 00:14:13.974
I'll talk to her again.

319
00:14:13.974 --> 00:14:16.443
Forget it. Stay out of it. I'll take care of it.

320
00:14:17.043 --> 00:14:19.014
Is it that hard to comfort her?

321
00:14:19.014 --> 00:14:21.014
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

322
00:14:33.264 --> 00:14:34.663
What is it?

323
00:14:35.864 --> 00:14:37.333
What is it?

324
00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:42.634
Dong Gu.

325
00:14:42.774 --> 00:14:44.943
Why did you wake me up?

326
00:14:45.073 --> 00:14:46.504
I'd like to take you somewhere.

327
00:14:46.504 --> 00:14:48.614
Where? At this hour?

328
00:14:48.774 --> 00:14:51.083
You'll see. Get up.

329
00:14:51.313 --> 00:14:52.813
I'm sleepy.

330
00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:54.683
Where are we going?

331
00:15:01.793 --> 00:15:03.593
What are we doing on top of the mountain?

332
00:15:04.463 --> 00:15:06.524
I have something...

333
00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.193
I want to tell you.

334
00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:10.293
Something to tell me?

335
00:15:10.963 --> 00:15:12.063
What is it?

336
00:15:12.063 --> 00:15:15.433
Seo Jin, failure is not falling down...

337
00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.974
but staying down.

338
00:15:19.943 --> 00:15:21.014
Seo Jin.

339
00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:26.514
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west every day.

340
00:15:27.083 --> 00:15:30.053
It moves halfway around the world every day...

341
00:15:30.053 --> 00:15:31.453
to rise again.

342
00:15:31.624 --> 00:15:32.884
And?

343
00:15:34.193 --> 00:15:37.793
If you keep going,

344
00:15:38.124 --> 00:15:41.264
you'll shine like the sun someday.

345
00:15:41.894 --> 00:15:43.494
Do you understand?

346
00:15:47.433 --> 00:15:49.874
You brat. Should we go down?

347
00:15:50.904 --> 00:15:53.343
Seo Jin, why don't we race?

348
00:15:54.144 --> 00:15:55.244
Hurry up.

349
00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:01.114
Dong Gu, are you okay?

350
00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:02.484
My goodness.

351
00:16:04.254 --> 00:16:05.683
I bumped...

352
00:16:05.683 --> 00:16:07.693
I bumped into a rock.

353
00:16:07.693 --> 00:16:09.823
Why did we come here so early?

354
00:16:10.024 --> 00:16:11.364
Can you stand up?

355
00:16:13.563 --> 00:16:15.264
I can't get up.

356
00:16:15.364 --> 00:16:17.163
The rock damaged my cartilage.

357
00:16:20.404 --> 00:16:21.534
It hurts.

358
00:16:24.604 --> 00:16:26.774
You told me to get up again after falling.

359
00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:28.343
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:28.443 --> 00:16:31.043
Don't forget what I said, Seo Jin.

361
00:16:31.144 --> 00:16:32.213
Falling isn't a failure...

362
00:16:32.213 --> 00:16:34.284
- Be quiet. - Okay.

363
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:35.484
Goodness.

364
00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:44.624
I'm sorry, Seo Jin. Don't be upset.

365
00:16:44.823 --> 00:16:46.264
What I did was wrong.

366
00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:49.563
You gave me such a hard time.

367
00:16:49.563 --> 00:16:51.404
It really hurt.

368
00:16:51.764 --> 00:16:53.333
My knee cartilage...

369
00:16:53.504 --> 00:16:55.374
was stabbed by a rock.

370
00:16:55.504 --> 00:16:56.534
Be quiet.

371
00:16:57.234 --> 00:16:59.874
Neither of you do anything right.

372
00:17:01.144 --> 00:17:03.673
I'll make Seo Jin feel better.

373
00:17:03.673 --> 00:17:04.914
Stay out of it.

374
00:17:04.984 --> 00:17:06.883
Don't you understand her at all?

375
00:17:06.883 --> 00:17:09.214
It's not hard to cheer her up.

376
00:17:10.924 --> 00:17:13.053
You're such amateurs.

377
00:17:24.863 --> 00:17:26.563
What is it this time?

378
00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:29.434
What?

379
00:17:31.143 --> 00:17:33.573
Get up. There's a place we must go.

380
00:17:34.414 --> 00:17:35.813
Where?

381
00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:38.113
Why won't anyone leave me alone?

382
00:17:38.113 --> 00:17:39.514
You'll find out where it is.

383
00:17:40.284 --> 00:17:41.313
Get up now.

384
00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:43.383
You're driving me crazy.

385
00:17:44.224 --> 00:17:45.254
I'm not going.

386
00:17:46.553 --> 00:17:47.593
Hurry.

387
00:17:48.293 --> 00:17:49.553
I don't want to.

388
00:17:49.724 --> 00:17:52.323
I won't go. I don't want to go.

389
00:17:52.494 --> 00:17:54.633
I don't want to go.

390
00:18:03.234 --> 00:18:04.744
Goodness.

391
00:18:04.843 --> 00:18:06.873
That startled me. Who is it?

392
00:18:07.373 --> 00:18:10.014
(Sun Woo says "Du Shik.")

393
00:18:10.014 --> 00:18:11.043
It's Sun Woo.

394
00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:14.684
Have you had lunch?

395
00:18:14.883 --> 00:18:17.014
Yes, I had...

396
00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:18.853
spaghetti.

397
00:18:18.853 --> 00:18:20.424
(I had spaghetti.)

398
00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.454
That sounds delicious.

399
00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:24.893
I love spaghetti.

400
00:18:24.994 --> 00:18:27.093
How about...

401
00:18:27.424 --> 00:18:30.293
we eat spaghetti together next time?

402
00:18:30.964 --> 00:18:33.333
Really? I'd love to.

403
00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.434
She's so cute.

404
00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:40.204
(Writer Bong, I read your script.)

405
00:18:40.403 --> 00:18:42.373
What is it? It's the director.

406
00:18:44.043 --> 00:18:47.214
Writer Bong, I read your script.

407
00:18:47.313 --> 00:18:50.113
However, the erotic scene is too ordinary.

408
00:18:50.284 --> 00:18:51.424
Really?

409
00:18:52.083 --> 00:18:55.754
I picked out a few erotic scenes...

410
00:18:55.853 --> 00:18:57.563
that may be interesting.

411
00:18:58.194 --> 00:19:00.123
I'll send them to you.

412
00:19:00.494 --> 00:19:04.363
Take a look and let me know what kind of scene you'd like.

413
00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:08.573
Wait, where did I put them?

414
00:19:09.803 --> 00:19:12.174
(Erotic files)

415
00:19:12.174 --> 00:19:13.573
Here they are.

416
00:19:13.573 --> 00:19:16.514
(Camera roll)

417
00:19:16.514 --> 00:19:17.613
- This one. - Du Shik.

418
00:19:17.744 --> 00:19:19.444
Can you recommend me some movies...

419
00:19:19.613 --> 00:19:21.284
that you enjoy?

420
00:19:21.284 --> 00:19:22.353
(Can you recommend me some movies that you enjoy?)

421
00:19:22.353 --> 00:19:24.394
Send. Okay.

422
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.893
These are a few.

423
00:19:27.893 --> 00:19:31.123
(These are a few.)

424
00:19:31.123 --> 00:19:33.323
This is done.

425
00:19:34.363 --> 00:19:35.994
Why isn't Sun Woo answering?

426
00:19:49.274 --> 00:19:51.143
Why...

427
00:19:51.143 --> 00:19:52.543
Why did I send these to Sun Woo?

428
00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:54.414
Darn it.

429
00:19:57.214 --> 00:19:58.784
She hasn't seen them yet.

430
00:19:58.883 --> 00:20:00.053
Please don't look.

431
00:20:00.053 --> 00:20:01.454
Please don't look at them.

432
00:20:01.454 --> 00:20:02.524
Du Shik.

433
00:20:04.164 --> 00:20:05.194
Sun Woo.

434
00:20:05.994 --> 00:20:07.063
Hello, sir.

435
00:20:07.063 --> 00:20:09.534
Where are you running to like a lunatic?

436
00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:11.133
Is something the matter?

437
00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:13.103
No, I was jogging.

438
00:20:13.103 --> 00:20:14.174
The weather's nice today.

439
00:20:14.803 --> 00:20:18.103
Sun Woo, did you read my message yet?

440
00:20:18.303 --> 00:20:21.043
Did you send me a message? I haven't checked yet.

441
00:20:21.573 --> 00:20:23.744
Dad suggested that we go out to eat.

442
00:20:23.744 --> 00:20:26.113
I left my phone at home.

443
00:20:26.714 --> 00:20:27.754
I see.

444
00:20:27.754 --> 00:20:30.484
Why did you send messages to my daughter?

445
00:20:30.484 --> 00:20:31.684
It's because...

446
00:20:31.684 --> 00:20:34.224
I asked him to recommend some good movies.

447
00:20:35.393 --> 00:20:37.153
Let's go eat, Dad.

448
00:20:37.494 --> 00:20:38.623
See you later.

449
00:20:38.623 --> 00:20:40.724
Okay, see you.

450
00:20:44.303 --> 00:20:45.333
Thank goodness.

451
00:20:46.504 --> 00:20:48.803
She hasn't seen them yet.

452
00:20:49.434 --> 00:20:50.474
Wait.

453
00:20:51.143 --> 00:20:52.774
If they're going out to eat,

454
00:20:53.343 --> 00:20:55.514
their house must be empty.

455
00:20:59.313 --> 00:21:00.914
Here we are.

456
00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.254
Did you wake me up to go for a drive?

457
00:21:09.093 --> 00:21:10.754
Isn't it great?

458
00:21:11.323 --> 00:21:13.924
There's also something that I want to tell you.

459
00:21:14.293 --> 00:21:15.664
There is?

460
00:21:15.664 --> 00:21:18.164
Why does everyone have something to tell me?

461
00:21:18.164 --> 00:21:19.403
What is it?

462
00:21:21.504 --> 00:21:23.674
Listen, Seo Jin.

463
00:21:24.744 --> 00:21:26.674
Failure is not falling down.

464
00:21:26.674 --> 00:21:28.373
It is not getting up again?

465
00:21:28.914 --> 00:21:30.113
How did you know?

466
00:21:30.113 --> 00:21:31.684
Did the three of you plan it?

467
00:21:31.784 --> 00:21:34.153
What is everyone saying since yesterday?

468
00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:37.883
Can't you understand?

469
00:21:38.484 --> 00:21:41.653
Seo Jin, take a look at those reeds.

470
00:21:43.623 --> 00:21:45.964
Look at those reeds.

471
00:21:47.164 --> 00:21:49.694
They move when the wind blows,

472
00:21:49.694 --> 00:21:51.204
but they never fall.

473
00:21:51.204 --> 00:21:53.234
- So what? - What I mean is...

474
00:21:53.234 --> 00:21:55.734
if you endure the wind that's blowing now,

475
00:21:55.734 --> 00:21:57.504
you'll get up again like those reeds.

476
00:21:57.504 --> 00:22:00.043
You'll make a beautiful flower bloom.

477
00:22:00.774 --> 00:22:02.043
Do you understand what I mean?

478
00:22:02.143 --> 00:22:04.843
Yes, so let's go home.

479
00:22:05.484 --> 00:22:06.613
Hey, kid.

480
00:22:07.113 --> 00:22:09.254
Do you feel better after hearing what I said?

481
00:22:09.254 --> 00:22:12.553
I feel so much better. Please, let's go home now.

482
00:22:12.984 --> 00:22:14.254
Gosh.

483
00:22:14.254 --> 00:22:17.123
You're so cute. Let's go home.

484
00:22:18.724 --> 00:22:21.434
Here we go.

485
00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:23.034
Let's go.

486
00:22:25.534 --> 00:22:27.803
- What's going on? - It's okay.

487
00:22:28.274 --> 00:22:30.674
It's not okay. The car isn't moving.

488
00:22:30.674 --> 00:22:32.944
It's warming up. It's okay.

489
00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:37.883
I saw many things

490
00:22:38.244 --> 00:22:39.914
Good job, Jun Ki.

491
00:22:43.254 --> 00:22:44.784
What's wrong with this?

492
00:22:46.184 --> 00:22:47.494
Hey, what's going on?

493
00:22:48.024 --> 00:22:49.093
What's going on?

494
00:22:49.254 --> 00:22:51.593
Seo Jin, wake up.

495
00:22:51.764 --> 00:22:54.464
Take it off. I can't drive properly.

496
00:22:54.694 --> 00:22:56.694
You never leave me alone, do you?

497
00:22:57.734 --> 00:22:59.434
What? What's wrong with this?

498
00:22:59.434 --> 00:23:00.504
It's broken.

499
00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:02.833
Can you remove it? We'll get into an accident.

500
00:23:03.073 --> 00:23:04.204
Goodness.

501
00:23:04.303 --> 00:23:05.974
This car is a mess like you.

502
00:23:12.543 --> 00:23:13.613
Good job.

503
00:23:15.383 --> 00:23:17.113
- What's wrong with this? - What?

504
00:23:17.553 --> 00:23:19.424
Can you do something?

505
00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:20.454
Wait a minute.

506
00:23:22.323 --> 00:23:23.754
It's going up.

507
00:23:23.754 --> 00:23:25.224
It doesn't work.

508
00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:27.194
Can you at least pull over?

509
00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:29.563
How can I pull over? There's a truck behind us.

510
00:23:29.563 --> 00:23:31.063
Should I stay like this?

511
00:23:31.164 --> 00:23:33.403
Wait, I'll try to pull over. Bear with me.

512
00:23:33.403 --> 00:23:34.434
It hurts.

513
00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:37.603
How could you do this to me?

514
00:23:37.603 --> 00:23:39.774
Didn't you know that I was like this?

515
00:23:39.803 --> 00:23:42.813
What's wrong with seeing another woman?

516
00:23:42.813 --> 00:23:44.383
You're overreacting.

517
00:23:44.383 --> 00:23:45.813
How can you say that?

518
00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:47.583
You jerk.

519
00:23:48.214 --> 00:23:49.883
Go ahead and hit me.

520
00:23:49.883 --> 00:23:52.153
Hit me, and let's make it a clean breakup.

521
00:23:52.153 --> 00:23:54.393
Go ahead and hit me. I'm ready.

522
00:23:54.593 --> 00:23:55.793
Stop crying.

523
00:23:55.793 --> 00:23:58.194
Let's make our breakup beautiful. Hit me.

524
00:24:35.534 --> 00:24:36.534
Goodness.

525
00:24:38.863 --> 00:24:41.034
Why do they live so high up?

526
00:24:41.734 --> 00:24:43.873
Is this the sixth floor?

527
00:24:43.873 --> 00:24:45.343
Where's 605?

528
00:24:45.343 --> 00:24:47.444
Where is 605?

529
00:24:48.073 --> 00:24:49.174
There's 605.

530
00:24:53.613 --> 00:24:55.484
Where's Sun Woo's room?

531
00:24:58.053 --> 00:24:59.083
This is the bathroom.

532
00:25:01.093 --> 00:25:02.593
This is his room.

533
00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:05.964
This is it.

534
00:25:11.363 --> 00:25:12.434
There it is.

535
00:25:19.373 --> 00:25:20.974
Who is it now? Goodness.

536
00:25:26.684 --> 00:25:29.883
How could you leave the wallet when we went out to eat?

537
00:25:30.383 --> 00:25:31.524
I know.

538
00:25:31.524 --> 00:25:33.853
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

539
00:25:34.853 --> 00:25:35.853
Sun Woo.

540
00:25:36.793 --> 00:25:39.063
Du Shik said that he sent me a message.

541
00:25:39.623 --> 00:25:41.694
- What are these? - What are they?

542
00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:45.234
What are these? That punk.

543
00:25:45.964 --> 00:25:47.573
He's out of his mind.

544
00:25:47.573 --> 00:25:48.603
That punk.

545
00:25:49.373 --> 00:25:51.843
No, Du Shik wouldn't do this.

546
00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:53.744
He's virtuous and innocent.

547
00:25:53.873 --> 00:25:56.573
How do you keep siding with him?

548
00:25:56.674 --> 00:25:58.414
Do you like him?

549
00:25:59.083 --> 00:26:01.684
Well, I don't like him yet.

550
00:26:01.684 --> 00:26:03.313
What do you mean by you don't? You are totally into him.

551
00:26:03.484 --> 00:26:06.224
How can you like someone like that?

552
00:26:06.323 --> 00:26:08.224
Why do you care so much?

553
00:26:08.353 --> 00:26:10.524
- Give it back to me. - What are you doing now?

554
00:26:10.524 --> 00:26:13.323
I'm going to check to see if he made a mistake sending it to me.

555
00:26:15.063 --> 00:26:17.034
"Pick up your phone!"

556
00:26:29.974 --> 00:26:31.083
Sir,

557
00:26:31.744 --> 00:26:33.843
this is not what you think.

558
00:26:34.184 --> 00:26:36.383
Sun Woo, it's not what you think.

559
00:26:37.113 --> 00:26:38.724
Let me explain.

560
00:26:43.254 --> 00:26:44.593
Why is this in my hand?

561
00:26:44.593 --> 00:26:46.393
What a pervert!

562
00:26:46.764 --> 00:26:47.833
No, I'm not.

563
00:26:48.633 --> 00:26:49.793
Ms. Kang Seo Jin,

564
00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:53.034
why did you slap someone's face?

565
00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:56.774
It's not like she slapped that person's face.

566
00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:59.444
Her arm was stuck in the window.

567
00:26:59.444 --> 00:27:00.603
Does that even make sense to you?

568
00:27:00.873 --> 00:27:03.343
Do you have any idea how badly he's injured now?

569
00:27:03.343 --> 00:27:04.883
I'm only telling you the truth.

570
00:27:05.043 --> 00:27:06.343
This is driving me crazy.

571
00:27:07.343 --> 00:27:09.553
Why did you slap his face?

572
00:27:09.684 --> 00:27:11.254
- He even passed out! - Seo Jin!

573
00:27:11.353 --> 00:27:12.424
Seo Jin, are you okay?

574
00:27:12.583 --> 00:27:14.153
What happened?

575
00:27:14.153 --> 00:27:15.924
What brought you to the police station?

576
00:27:16.254 --> 00:27:18.623
What did you do to her?

577
00:27:18.623 --> 00:27:21.264
I was just driving.

578
00:27:21.264 --> 00:27:23.164
- A newspaper got in the way... - What?

579
00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:26.504
Her arm was stuck in the window all of a sudden.

580
00:27:26.664 --> 00:27:29.034
That's not what I did! That wasn't what you think.

581
00:27:29.034 --> 00:27:30.133
Du Shik.

582
00:27:31.603 --> 00:27:33.643
- What are you doing here? - Dong Gu!

583
00:27:34.043 --> 00:27:35.143
Let me go!

584
00:27:35.274 --> 00:27:36.974
Dong Gu!

585
00:27:37.613 --> 00:27:38.744
Dong Gu.

586
00:27:38.944 --> 00:27:40.543
What happened?

587
00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.984
Please tell them I'm not a pervert.

588
00:27:43.053 --> 00:27:44.524
Of course! You are not a pervert.

589
00:27:44.524 --> 00:27:47.284
- Who said that? - Look what's going on.

590
00:27:49.823 --> 00:27:53.093
Why did you break into someone's house?

591
00:27:53.724 --> 00:27:54.793
I don't know.

592
00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:56.734
Please don't ask anything.

593
00:27:58.434 --> 00:28:01.274
Just be happy that it only ended up with the 100m restraining order.

594
00:28:01.274 --> 00:28:04.303
You could've ended up getting an ankle monitor.

595
00:28:07.674 --> 00:28:09.714
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

596
00:28:09.774 --> 00:28:11.484
You know that wasn't my intention.

597
00:28:11.583 --> 00:28:14.313
- I just wanted to cheer you up. - When did I ask you for that?

598
00:28:14.984 --> 00:28:17.313
Just leave me alone.

599
00:28:17.313 --> 00:28:20.323
I'm stressed as it is. Why are you guys acting like this?

600
00:28:20.323 --> 00:28:21.724
I didn't do anything though.

601
00:28:22.424 --> 00:28:24.464
Seo Jin! Seo Jin!

602
00:28:24.823 --> 00:28:26.823
I said I'm sorry.

603
00:28:27.024 --> 00:28:28.534
How can I make it up to you?

604
00:28:29.034 --> 00:28:31.464
I'll do everything you say.

605
00:28:31.464 --> 00:28:33.133
I can even die here if you say so.

606
00:28:33.264 --> 00:28:35.133
What was that? Strip show?

607
00:28:35.333 --> 00:28:38.174
I can even do that here. Just tell me what to do.

608
00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:40.643
- I can do it! - There you go!

609
00:28:40.744 --> 00:28:41.843
- Yes! - Alright.

610
00:28:41.944 --> 00:28:44.073
- Do it then. - What do you want?

611
00:28:44.073 --> 00:28:45.843
- Do a strip show. - What?

612
00:28:47.414 --> 00:28:48.553
Now?

613
00:28:49.153 --> 00:28:51.224
Here? In this weather?

614
00:28:51.323 --> 00:28:52.853
Why? Can't you do it?

615
00:28:53.454 --> 00:28:56.454
Then don't ever talk to me again.

616
00:28:56.793 --> 00:28:57.823
Did you get it?

617
00:28:57.823 --> 00:28:59.823
Seo Jin, Seo Jin!

618
00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:01.464
Seo Jin!

619
00:29:01.764 --> 00:29:02.863
Seo Jin!

620
00:29:08.974 --> 00:29:10.103
Strip show...

621
00:29:15.343 --> 00:29:16.813
Kang Seo Jin!

622
00:29:19.244 --> 00:29:20.383
What!

623
00:29:26.653 --> 00:29:28.424
- What? - Dong Gu...

624
00:29:31.464 --> 00:29:32.994
What is he doing?

625
00:29:32.994 --> 00:29:35.393
Why? You told me to do this.

626
00:29:37.704 --> 00:29:39.504
What are you guys doing?

627
00:29:40.063 --> 00:29:42.234
You should do it too.

628
00:29:42.234 --> 00:29:43.903
I just got released.

629
00:29:44.543 --> 00:29:45.873
Look!

630
00:29:49.543 --> 00:29:50.843
Gosh, it's cold.

631
00:29:51.343 --> 00:29:52.444
Seo Jin,

632
00:29:53.043 --> 00:29:55.053
there's nothing wrong with you.

633
00:29:55.714 --> 00:29:59.353
What's so wrong with slapping a pervert's face?

634
00:29:59.353 --> 00:30:00.583
Don't you agree?

635
00:30:00.583 --> 00:30:03.454
I agree. He deserves that.

636
00:30:03.454 --> 00:30:06.194
How can you give up your dream just because of someone like him?

637
00:30:06.823 --> 00:30:09.893
You'll get a job at a better place soon.

638
00:30:09.893 --> 00:30:11.363
- Don't you worry. - He is right!

639
00:30:11.563 --> 00:30:14.873
- Yes! - So please cheer up.

640
00:30:14.873 --> 00:30:15.934
He's right.

641
00:30:16.934 --> 00:30:20.204
Cheer up, Seo Jin!

642
00:30:24.684 --> 00:30:27.514
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

643
00:30:32.724 --> 00:30:33.784
What is wrong with them?

644
00:30:36.393 --> 00:30:37.893
Stop it.

645
00:30:37.994 --> 00:30:40.063
People are watching.

646
00:30:40.893 --> 00:30:42.293
- She's smiling! - She's feeling better!

647
00:30:42.293 --> 00:30:43.464
- We did it! - She's fine now!

648
00:30:43.734 --> 00:30:45.133
- Finally! - Yes!

649
00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:47.803
I feel better now. Put your clothes on.

650
00:30:47.803 --> 00:30:49.903
- Let's put it back on. - Yes!

651
00:30:51.573 --> 00:30:52.674
What are you doing?

652
00:30:53.803 --> 00:30:54.843
- Run! - Run!

653
00:30:54.843 --> 00:30:56.313
This is not what you think!

00:31:11.823 --> 00:31:13.823
What is he doing?

656
00:31:14.793 --> 00:31:15.994
What a pervert.

657
00:31:17.063 --> 00:31:18.303
Sun Woo!

658
00:31:19.664 --> 00:31:21.004
I'm sorry.

659
00:31:21.633 --> 00:31:22.873
I...

660
00:31:23.633 --> 00:31:27.103
I have a restraining order of 100m,

661
00:31:27.373 --> 00:31:30.014
so I can't go any closer.

662
00:31:30.113 --> 00:31:31.313
What is he saying?

663
00:31:32.284 --> 00:31:33.684
Sun Woo!

664
00:31:35.083 --> 00:31:36.414
I'm sorry.

665
00:31:37.113 --> 00:31:40.353
I guess I'm just one of those guys.

666
00:31:40.823 --> 00:31:45.224
To be honest, I've been writing a scenario for an erotic movie.

667
00:31:45.694 --> 00:31:48.534
I'm really sorry.

668
00:31:55.133 --> 00:31:56.474
Move quickly.

669
00:31:56.603 --> 00:31:59.403
The group of guests will check in shortly.

670
00:31:59.403 --> 00:32:00.573
I see.

671
00:32:00.774 --> 00:32:04.113
But why are we giving them our rooms even though they are a big group?

672
00:32:04.514 --> 00:32:05.784
Where do we sleep then?

673
00:32:05.784 --> 00:32:07.813
We can sleep in the living room.

674
00:32:08.214 --> 00:32:10.053
It's been a while since we had a big group of guests.

675
00:32:10.113 --> 00:32:13.184
She's right. Just think about the rent we couldn't pay yet.

676
00:32:13.184 --> 00:32:15.153
The landlord called me earlier.

677
00:32:15.153 --> 00:32:16.293
Really?

678
00:32:16.653 --> 00:32:18.863
- Didn't she tell us to get out now? - Yes.

679
00:32:18.863 --> 00:32:20.793
That sounds bad.

680
00:32:22.164 --> 00:32:25.303
What is he doing by the way? We are really busy today.

681
00:32:25.303 --> 00:32:26.403
Can't you see what I'm doing?

682
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:29.774
I'm taking care of myself. It's called mind control.

683
00:32:29.774 --> 00:32:31.303
What does he mean by that?

684
00:32:31.573 --> 00:32:34.674
Leave him. It's his first shooting for the soap opera today.

685
00:32:34.674 --> 00:32:37.313
He just wants to copy whatever celebrities do.

686
00:32:37.744 --> 00:32:38.883
Don't you agree?

687
00:32:40.214 --> 00:32:41.353
Yoon Ah?

688
00:32:41.454 --> 00:32:43.014
Yes? Why?

689
00:32:43.014 --> 00:32:44.883
What's going on? Are you sick?

690
00:32:47.284 --> 00:32:49.224
I've been feeling bad since this morning.

691
00:32:49.293 --> 00:32:50.393
Really?

692
00:32:51.623 --> 00:32:53.164
You are sweating so much.

693
00:32:55.494 --> 00:32:57.534
You are burning up.

694
00:33:02.234 --> 00:33:03.534
It's swine flu.

695
00:33:03.974 --> 00:33:06.343
- Swine flu? - Swine...

696
00:33:06.343 --> 00:33:08.313
You don't have to worry about it too much.

697
00:33:08.414 --> 00:33:10.514
You just need to take some pills and rest for a bit.

698
00:33:11.414 --> 00:33:14.954
But it's highly contagious. So you should be separated from others.

699
00:33:15.113 --> 00:33:17.153
It's highly contagious? How contagious is it?

700
00:33:17.153 --> 00:33:18.684
It's very contagious.

701
00:33:18.784 --> 00:33:21.424
You can catch through her cough or fluids.

702
00:33:21.754 --> 00:33:25.664
("A Perfect Room to Recover")

703
00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:29.393
I'm sorry.

704
00:33:29.563 --> 00:33:31.633
We even have so many guests today.

705
00:33:32.004 --> 00:33:33.063
It's okay.

706
00:33:33.464 --> 00:33:36.373
At least you'll be fine after taking some medicine and getting rest.

707
00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:38.043
What should we do now?

708
00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:40.843
What if our guests get the flu?

709
00:33:41.014 --> 00:33:42.113
I know...

710
00:33:42.244 --> 00:33:43.774
She should be separated.

711
00:33:43.914 --> 00:33:45.843
But we even gave all of our rooms to the guest.

712
00:33:46.014 --> 00:33:47.613
We have no rooms left.

713
00:33:48.754 --> 00:33:51.053
Should we book a motel for her around here?

714
00:33:51.053 --> 00:33:52.153
What?

715
00:33:52.153 --> 00:33:54.924
How can you make a lady to stay at the motel alone?

716
00:33:54.924 --> 00:33:56.653
I can't believe how cold-hearted you are.

717
00:33:56.653 --> 00:33:59.863
If you are really worried about her, you can take that mask off.

718
00:34:00.393 --> 00:34:02.194
Today's my first shoot.

719
00:34:03.363 --> 00:34:04.534
Yoon Ah, you must be okay with this, right?

720
00:34:04.903 --> 00:34:05.964
Of course.

721
00:34:06.034 --> 00:34:07.133
I like that.

722
00:34:07.234 --> 00:34:08.734
She can't stay at the motel though.

723
00:34:08.974 --> 00:34:11.443
What if the guest at the motel get the flu too?

724
00:34:11.943 --> 00:34:14.213
You are right. What should we do then?

725
00:34:21.053 --> 00:34:22.713
Don't you think this is too much?

726
00:34:23.014 --> 00:34:24.454
How can we make someone sick stay here?

727
00:34:24.454 --> 00:34:25.983
Do you have any other idea?

728
00:34:25.983 --> 00:34:27.954
Should we cancel the reservation then?

729
00:34:28.253 --> 00:34:30.294
- But this is... - Look.

730
00:34:30.294 --> 00:34:32.064
I'm really okay.

731
00:34:32.294 --> 00:34:35.994
I'm not only worried about the guests. I'm also worried about Sol.

732
00:34:36.564 --> 00:34:37.903
There's an electric heating blanket in there,

733
00:34:37.903 --> 00:34:40.104
and I even installed a heater. So it won't be too cold.

734
00:34:40.633 --> 00:34:43.733
And it's partially your fault for not taking better care of yourself.

735
00:34:43.733 --> 00:34:45.044
Just bear with it a bit even though it's uncomfortable.

736
00:34:45.204 --> 00:34:48.244
How can you be so disgusting like that?

737
00:34:48.343 --> 00:34:50.113
You are cold-hearted.

738
00:34:50.113 --> 00:34:51.343
Close the door!

739
00:34:54.284 --> 00:34:56.753
Wait, what about the bathroom?

740
00:34:58.883 --> 00:35:00.994
I couldn't think about the bathroom.

741
00:35:10.494 --> 00:35:13.164
You can't really do this though.

742
00:35:13.264 --> 00:35:14.604
He's right about it.

743
00:35:14.704 --> 00:35:16.934
You are abusing her right as a human being.

744
00:35:17.133 --> 00:35:19.403
How can you make her do this?

745
00:35:19.403 --> 00:35:20.943
I'm not doing this because I want it.

746
00:35:22.173 --> 00:35:23.943
Where did you get this by the way?

747
00:35:23.943 --> 00:35:26.443
I borrowed it from the lady at Mi Dal's Snacks.

748
00:35:28.383 --> 00:35:29.954
Mi Dal used to use this.

749
00:35:30.113 --> 00:35:32.784
If you push this button, it plays a song. You'll feel less embarrassed.

750
00:35:32.784 --> 00:35:34.193
Oh, right. She'll definitely feel less embarrassed!

751
00:35:34.193 --> 00:35:37.153
He is such a cruel person!

752
00:35:37.153 --> 00:35:38.463
Stop it.

753
00:35:38.863 --> 00:35:41.794
I'm really okay. Please look after Sol for me.

754
00:35:41.794 --> 00:35:43.294
Don't worry about Sol, Yoon Ah.

755
00:35:45.104 --> 00:35:47.334
The guests will be here shortly. Let's go!

756
00:36:01.684 --> 00:36:03.684
They should be here by now.

757
00:36:04.084 --> 00:36:05.224
They'll be here soon.

758
00:36:05.523 --> 00:36:07.323
Will Yoon Ah be all right?

759
00:36:07.323 --> 00:36:08.923
The weather is so cold. I'm worried about her.

760
00:36:08.923 --> 00:36:09.923
I know.

761
00:36:10.994 --> 00:36:12.064
What did you say to her?

762
00:36:12.363 --> 00:36:15.133
It's her fault for getting sick, so she should deal with it?

763
00:36:15.133 --> 00:36:16.264
What?

764
00:36:16.693 --> 00:36:19.003
It's true that she failed to take care of herself.

765
00:36:19.003 --> 00:36:20.003
You brat.

766
00:36:20.003 --> 00:36:21.034
They're here.

767
00:36:21.034 --> 00:36:22.233
- They're here. - They're here.

768
00:36:22.934 --> 00:36:24.003
Over here.

769
00:36:24.003 --> 00:36:26.003
Seo Jin, please show them to their rooms.

770
00:36:26.003 --> 00:36:27.144
Okay.

771
00:36:28.943 --> 00:36:30.713
I'm so happy.

772
00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:35.414
Welcome.

773
00:36:35.483 --> 00:36:36.954
Good afternoon.

774
00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:38.724
Come on in.

775
00:36:42.153 --> 00:36:44.764
It's been long since we had a group reservation.

776
00:36:44.764 --> 00:36:45.794
I know.

777
00:36:46.093 --> 00:36:48.064
Dong Gu, like I said...

778
00:36:49.034 --> 00:36:50.133
- Hey. - What?

779
00:36:50.693 --> 00:36:52.363
You have a runny nose.

780
00:36:52.503 --> 00:36:53.534
A runny nose?

781
00:36:55.773 --> 00:36:57.003
Why do I suddenly have a runny nose?

782
00:36:57.843 --> 00:36:58.903
Come here.

783
00:36:59.744 --> 00:37:00.773
Wait.

784
00:37:01.144 --> 00:37:02.443
You have a fever too.

785
00:37:03.113 --> 00:37:04.144
Could it be...

786
00:37:04.883 --> 00:37:08.454
No way. It can't be.

787
00:37:10.153 --> 00:37:11.553
- It's not. - Go away!

788
00:37:12.483 --> 00:37:13.523
Virus!

789
00:37:14.294 --> 00:37:16.423
My gosh.

790
00:37:19.624 --> 00:37:20.664
Dong Gu.

791
00:37:21.593 --> 00:37:23.193
Is that a sleeping bag?

792
00:37:23.834 --> 00:37:26.963
He's been diagnosed with swine flu too.

793
00:37:29.534 --> 00:37:31.544
Go in. Right now.

794
00:37:31.704 --> 00:37:34.414
I'm going in. Stop poking me.

795
00:37:37.443 --> 00:37:39.284
Why is it taking so long to go in?

796
00:37:46.653 --> 00:37:49.653
Did you get it from me?

797
00:37:49.653 --> 00:37:51.764
Who else could it be?

798
00:37:52.823 --> 00:37:55.733
I have to film a party tomorrow. I can't believe this.

799
00:37:58.363 --> 00:37:59.403
Gosh.

800
00:38:09.343 --> 00:38:10.573
Turning left.

801
00:38:10.814 --> 00:38:11.983
Turning right.

802
00:38:12.644 --> 00:38:13.684
Turning right.

803
00:38:14.113 --> 00:38:15.113
Turning right.

804
00:38:17.584 --> 00:38:19.124
My voice is hoarse today.

805
00:38:20.584 --> 00:38:21.653
Wait.

806
00:38:21.753 --> 00:38:23.494
I hope I didn't catch the flu.

807
00:38:23.854 --> 00:38:26.963
This is the first day of shooting. I better do a good job.

808
00:38:28.894 --> 00:38:30.903
Gosh. Who is it?

809
00:38:31.604 --> 00:38:33.534
My neck. My eyes.

810
00:38:35.374 --> 00:38:37.843
Gosh. Seriously.

811
00:38:39.173 --> 00:38:40.443
Why won't it open?

812
00:38:40.914 --> 00:38:42.014
Gosh.

813
00:38:43.343 --> 00:38:45.244
My eyes. My neck.

814
00:38:46.383 --> 00:38:47.854
Rebecca.

815
00:38:48.483 --> 00:38:50.414
Gosh. Rebecca.

816
00:38:50.713 --> 00:38:51.724
Oh, my.

817
00:38:51.784 --> 00:38:53.724
Can't you drive better?

818
00:38:53.724 --> 00:38:55.954
I'm sorry. I'm a beginner.

819
00:38:55.954 --> 00:38:58.124
If you're a bad driver, don't drive.

820
00:38:58.124 --> 00:38:59.863
Gosh, I'm so unlucky.

821
00:38:59.863 --> 00:39:02.294
I'm in a hurry. Give me your phone number.

822
00:39:02.294 --> 00:39:04.093
Okay.

823
00:39:04.093 --> 00:39:05.334
Hurry.

824
00:39:05.363 --> 00:39:07.934
- Give me your business card. - Okay. I'm sorry.

825
00:39:07.934 --> 00:39:09.704
You outlaw on the road.

826
00:39:09.704 --> 00:39:11.044
You potential murderer.

827
00:39:11.374 --> 00:39:13.544
What were you thinking?

828
00:39:13.773 --> 00:39:14.943
My eyes.

829
00:39:15.244 --> 00:39:17.144
Rebecca, don't cry.

830
00:39:17.584 --> 00:39:18.613
Rebecca.

831
00:39:19.414 --> 00:39:21.753
Gosh, that outlaw on the road.

832
00:39:28.593 --> 00:39:29.753
Good morning.

833
00:39:30.423 --> 00:39:31.494
You're here.

834
00:39:32.124 --> 00:39:34.133
Your eyes... What's wrong with your neck?

835
00:39:34.133 --> 00:39:36.633
I had a minor car accident on the way.

836
00:39:37.233 --> 00:39:39.764
But it won't affect the shooting. I'm okay.

837
00:39:39.764 --> 00:39:41.204
That's a relief.

838
00:39:41.573 --> 00:39:42.633
Did you practice a lot?

839
00:39:42.633 --> 00:39:43.803
Of course.

840
00:39:44.073 --> 00:39:46.443
Don't worry.

841
00:39:46.673 --> 00:39:49.044
This is why I like you.

842
00:39:49.713 --> 00:39:52.044
Director, Writer Kwon is here.

843
00:39:52.184 --> 00:39:53.284
She's here?

844
00:39:55.553 --> 00:39:56.584
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

845
00:39:56.584 --> 00:39:58.854
- You've never met her, have you? - No.

846
00:39:58.854 --> 00:40:00.684
Let's go. Let me introduce you to her.

847
00:40:00.954 --> 00:40:02.023
- You will? - Yes.

848
00:40:02.124 --> 00:40:03.124
Okay.

849
00:40:03.224 --> 00:40:04.423
I'll treasure it...

850
00:40:08.934 --> 00:40:09.934
Ms. Kwon.

851
00:40:10.764 --> 00:40:11.834
You startled me.

852
00:40:11.834 --> 00:40:13.764
You must be busy. What brings you here?

853
00:40:19.474 --> 00:40:20.544
Where did he go?

854
00:40:21.514 --> 00:40:22.544
Who?

855
00:40:22.943 --> 00:40:23.943
Let's go.

856
00:40:24.584 --> 00:40:25.914
Let's take a 10-minute break.

857
00:40:32.084 --> 00:40:33.483
It's that outlaw.

858
00:40:44.073 --> 00:40:47.274
Dong Gu, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

859
00:40:49.404 --> 00:40:50.643
Forget it.

860
00:40:53.243 --> 00:40:54.283
Yoon Ah.

861
00:40:55.843 --> 00:40:58.254
May I give you a piece of advice?

862
00:40:59.484 --> 00:41:00.553
What is it?

863
00:41:01.084 --> 00:41:02.283
You're...

864
00:41:02.924 --> 00:41:04.823
a bit of a nuisance to others. Do you know that?

865
00:41:05.654 --> 00:41:07.794
I know you don't mean to,

866
00:41:07.794 --> 00:41:11.134
but you keep causing others trouble.

867
00:41:11.834 --> 00:41:13.564
It's not good.

868
00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:16.203
You might become too used to it.

869
00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:19.573
I'm just concerned about you.

870
00:41:20.203 --> 00:41:22.404
Please don't take it personally.

871
00:41:22.404 --> 00:41:23.473
Of course not.

872
00:41:23.973 --> 00:41:25.444
I'll be careful.

873
00:41:25.743 --> 00:41:29.814
I hate causing others trouble more than anything.

874
00:41:29.884 --> 00:41:33.814
I really don't understand you. Goodness.

875
00:41:34.453 --> 00:41:35.984
How do you do that?

876
00:41:47.564 --> 00:41:48.834
Over here.

877
00:41:49.064 --> 00:41:50.303
- Hello. - Hello.

878
00:41:50.504 --> 00:41:51.734
It's cold, right?

879
00:41:53.174 --> 00:41:54.243
- Have a seat. - Okay.

880
00:41:54.243 --> 00:41:56.504
- I'm pushing your chair in. - Thank you.

881
00:42:00.783 --> 00:42:02.683
Are you feeling okay?

882
00:42:02.783 --> 00:42:05.513
Me? I feel perfectly fine.

883
00:42:05.683 --> 00:42:07.683
I feel even healthier...

884
00:42:07.683 --> 00:42:09.223
after the accident.

885
00:42:09.223 --> 00:42:10.524
I even have more appetite now.

886
00:42:12.323 --> 00:42:13.553
That's good.

887
00:42:14.924 --> 00:42:16.663
Why did you want to see me?

888
00:42:16.663 --> 00:42:17.734
Well...

889
00:42:18.663 --> 00:42:22.234
I was worried if I was too rude to you.

890
00:42:22.933 --> 00:42:26.033
I was so worried...

891
00:42:26.033 --> 00:42:29.044
that I hurt your feelings.

892
00:42:29.643 --> 00:42:30.774
Not at all.

893
00:42:31.314 --> 00:42:32.314
The thing is,

894
00:42:32.814 --> 00:42:35.314
I wasn't in my right mind this morning.

895
00:42:36.643 --> 00:42:38.714
I'm not sure if I should tell you this.

896
00:42:39.413 --> 00:42:40.854
An old friend of mine...

897
00:42:42.254 --> 00:42:44.323
died this morning.

898
00:42:46.794 --> 00:42:48.064
His name is Kang Dong Gu.

899
00:42:50.024 --> 00:42:51.564
We were like brothers.

900
00:42:51.993 --> 00:42:53.533
I see.

901
00:42:54.634 --> 00:42:56.163
Now that I think of it,

902
00:42:56.464 --> 00:42:58.033
he used to come here a lot.

903
00:43:00.104 --> 00:43:01.174
Dong Gu...

904
00:43:06.714 --> 00:43:08.613
Here. Have this.

905
00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:11.754
You don't have to do this.

906
00:43:11.754 --> 00:43:12.814
No problem.

907
00:43:12.913 --> 00:43:16.154
I just feel too bad. Don't worry.

908
00:43:16.884 --> 00:43:19.553
Hold on. Isn't it a bit cold in here?

909
00:43:20.493 --> 00:43:21.493
Excuse me.

910
00:43:22.163 --> 00:43:24.334
Can we have a blanket?

911
00:43:24.334 --> 00:43:25.533
- Sure. - Okay.

912
00:43:26.493 --> 00:43:27.703
Go ahead.

913
00:43:35.973 --> 00:43:38.374
I hope you liked the food.

914
00:43:38.444 --> 00:43:39.573
I loved it.

915
00:43:40.683 --> 00:43:41.743
That's good.

916
00:43:42.584 --> 00:43:45.683
Please forget about...

917
00:43:45.754 --> 00:43:47.354
my mistake this morning.

918
00:43:47.354 --> 00:43:48.624
Of course.

919
00:43:50.484 --> 00:43:53.493
Take care. Bye.

920
00:43:55.093 --> 00:43:56.093
Hold on.

921
00:43:56.263 --> 00:43:57.464
What is it?

922
00:43:57.564 --> 00:44:00.634
Do you have a girlfriend?

923
00:44:00.634 --> 00:44:03.263
Me? A girlfriend?

924
00:44:03.834 --> 00:44:05.904
No, I don't. Why?

925
00:44:07.004 --> 00:44:10.073
What? So you decided to date the writer?

926
00:44:10.874 --> 00:44:12.044
What could I have done?

927
00:44:12.343 --> 00:44:15.743
If I turned her down, she'd hold a grudge against me.

928
00:44:15.814 --> 00:44:19.613
I'll just go out with her while shooting the drama.

929
00:44:21.183 --> 00:44:23.524
You got yourself in trouble again.

930
00:44:24.093 --> 00:44:25.194
Gosh.

931
00:44:26.593 --> 00:44:28.723
Wait. What time is it now?

932
00:44:34.763 --> 00:44:36.004
I brought you dinner.

933
00:44:38.504 --> 00:44:39.533
Hey.

934
00:44:39.533 --> 00:44:40.803
I'm busy so I'll be going.

935
00:44:42.944 --> 00:44:45.413
That punk. Are we animals?

936
00:44:45.413 --> 00:44:48.013
Is it feeding time for us? We're not prisoners.

937
00:44:49.814 --> 00:44:51.154
I'll get it.

938
00:44:51.913 --> 00:44:54.283
Forget it. I'll get it.

939
00:44:55.053 --> 00:44:56.323
Gosh.

940
00:44:59.953 --> 00:45:01.064
Those brats.

941
00:45:01.424 --> 00:45:03.694
Don't they even want to check on us?

942
00:45:09.763 --> 00:45:10.834
Dong Gu.

943
00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:11.973
- My back. - Are you okay?

944
00:45:11.973 --> 00:45:13.004
My back.

945
00:45:14.203 --> 00:45:16.143
- Dong Gu. - My back.

946
00:45:16.343 --> 00:45:17.613
Are you all right?

947
00:45:18.013 --> 00:45:20.444
I'm okay. I'm...

948
00:45:22.944 --> 00:45:26.754
That hurts so much. I can't move.

949
00:45:34.424 --> 00:45:35.723
Aren't you going to eat?

950
00:45:35.893 --> 00:45:37.263
I will.

951
00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:38.834
Goodness.

952
00:45:42.163 --> 00:45:43.564
My lower back hurts.

953
00:45:44.573 --> 00:45:47.004
Yoon Ah, can you help me get up?

954
00:45:48.843 --> 00:45:49.944
Why?

955
00:45:50.203 --> 00:45:52.874
You said that you don't like to be indebted to someone.

956
00:45:53.013 --> 00:45:54.214
You said that it's impolite...

957
00:45:54.314 --> 00:45:55.584
and could become a bad habit.

958
00:45:56.884 --> 00:45:58.413
Forget it.

959
00:45:58.584 --> 00:46:00.384
I asked for fun.

960
00:46:00.823 --> 00:46:02.484
I'll eat while lying down.

961
00:46:03.024 --> 00:46:04.493
Your eyes are so big.

962
00:46:05.794 --> 00:46:08.163
Why doesn't it work?

963
00:46:09.964 --> 00:46:11.163
Shall I feed you?

964
00:46:11.393 --> 00:46:13.433
- No thanks. - Fine.

965
00:46:22.573 --> 00:46:26.343
You can feed me if you really want to.

966
00:46:38.393 --> 00:46:41.424
Yoon Ah, as I told you,

967
00:46:41.564 --> 00:46:44.433
I don't like to ask people favors.

968
00:46:44.834 --> 00:46:46.564
So don't misunderstand...

969
00:46:48.604 --> 00:46:49.763
Water.

970
00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:51.874
Here you go.

971
00:46:56.473 --> 00:46:57.714
I almost died.

972
00:47:00.683 --> 00:47:04.453
I'm not usually indebted to people.

973
00:47:04.453 --> 00:47:05.584
I understand.

974
00:47:05.814 --> 00:47:07.553
I understand, so just eat.

975
00:47:09.453 --> 00:47:10.624
Yoon Ah.

976
00:47:11.754 --> 00:47:13.294
Can you give me some ham...

977
00:47:13.794 --> 00:47:14.924
wrapped in dried laver?

978
00:47:16.024 --> 00:47:17.393
I had two spoons of rice already.

979
00:47:30.004 --> 00:47:31.444
I have to pee.

980
00:47:31.843 --> 00:47:33.714
Did I drink too much water?

981
00:47:34.613 --> 00:47:35.984
My goodness.

982
00:47:58.803 --> 00:47:59.874
Gosh.

983
00:48:00.274 --> 00:48:03.073
- Dong Gu, are you okay? - Yes.

984
00:48:03.073 --> 00:48:05.073
Where are you going?

985
00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:07.113
I want to get some fresh air.

986
00:48:07.913 --> 00:48:10.084
No way. You aren't well.

987
00:48:10.584 --> 00:48:11.754
Lie back down.

988
00:48:17.424 --> 00:48:18.654
I want to pee.

989
00:48:18.953 --> 00:48:20.093
What?

990
00:48:21.763 --> 00:48:24.163
I want to pee.

991
00:48:24.634 --> 00:48:26.863
- Pardon? - I want to pee.

992
00:48:29.234 --> 00:48:30.703
We're almost there. We'll stop.

993
00:48:33.274 --> 00:48:35.104
Go down straight.

994
00:48:39.743 --> 00:48:40.843
There you go.

995
00:48:42.314 --> 00:48:45.553
Dong Gu, can you unzip your pants?

996
00:48:46.113 --> 00:48:48.654
Of course, I can unzip myself.

997
00:48:48.754 --> 00:48:50.124
Who do you think I am?

998
00:48:50.124 --> 00:48:52.254
Didn't I tell you that...

999
00:48:52.254 --> 00:48:53.493
I don't bother people?

1000
00:48:55.723 --> 00:48:57.363
I'm fine, so you may leave.

1001
00:49:07.374 --> 00:49:10.343
She'll hear me from inside the tent.

1002
00:49:11.374 --> 00:49:12.473
Goodness.

1003
00:49:36.763 --> 00:49:37.834
Yes.

1004
00:49:39.203 --> 00:49:40.374
Yes, Hye Jin.

1005
00:49:42.374 --> 00:49:44.513
See you in the evening.

1006
00:49:46.143 --> 00:49:48.214
Okay, bye.

1007
00:49:49.544 --> 00:49:50.854
Gosh, it's hot.

1008
00:49:51.384 --> 00:49:53.354
It's not like you're dating for the first time.

1009
00:49:53.354 --> 00:49:55.024
How can you stay on the phone all night?

1010
00:49:55.024 --> 00:49:57.424
What can I do? She wouldn't hang up.

1011
00:49:58.524 --> 00:50:01.363
Do you know what she said before hanging up?

1012
00:50:02.323 --> 00:50:04.334
She wants to discuss more details in person.

1013
00:50:04.433 --> 00:50:06.694
Doesn't she write scripts as a writer?

1014
00:50:06.834 --> 00:50:09.464
What? Are you going on another date today?

1015
00:50:09.464 --> 00:50:10.564
Yes.

1016
00:50:11.203 --> 00:50:12.874
Why is life so hard?

1017
00:50:13.374 --> 00:50:14.573
Do I have to...

1018
00:50:16.544 --> 00:50:17.643
It's the director.

1019
00:50:18.544 --> 00:50:19.944
Hello, this is Jun Ki.

1020
00:50:21.683 --> 00:50:22.743
Yes.

1021
00:50:23.913 --> 00:50:25.013
Right now?

1022
00:50:30.654 --> 00:50:32.453
Why are you drinking so much in the morning?

1023
00:50:33.124 --> 00:50:34.323
Did something happen?

1024
00:50:35.363 --> 00:50:37.663
I had a fight with my girlfriend recently.

1025
00:50:37.993 --> 00:50:39.093
She said that...

1026
00:50:40.703 --> 00:50:42.734
we should take some time to think.

1027
00:50:43.464 --> 00:50:45.374
I think she fell for another man.

1028
00:50:45.573 --> 00:50:46.674
Pardon?

1029
00:50:46.933 --> 00:50:49.374
How can she be so harsh?

1030
00:50:49.743 --> 00:50:52.613
I didn't know that you had a girlfriend.

1031
00:50:52.743 --> 00:50:54.743
- This is a secret. - Okay.

1032
00:50:55.384 --> 00:50:56.584
Don't tell anyone.

1033
00:50:56.714 --> 00:50:57.854
Okay.

1034
00:50:58.154 --> 00:50:59.254
It's Writer Kwon.

1035
00:51:04.723 --> 00:51:06.154
Writer Kwon?

1036
00:51:07.053 --> 00:51:09.093
Do you mean the one who's writing the drama script?

1037
00:51:09.263 --> 00:51:11.393
Yes, just wait and see.

1038
00:51:11.593 --> 00:51:13.093
Whoever it is,

1039
00:51:14.033 --> 00:51:15.763
I'll do something about him.

1040
00:51:15.933 --> 00:51:17.604
What? How...

1041
00:51:19.433 --> 00:51:21.573
I'll find him no matter what.

1042
00:51:22.874 --> 00:51:25.214
I'll beat him up.

1043
00:51:28.884 --> 00:51:30.013
What?

1044
00:51:30.343 --> 00:51:32.714
Your director was dating that writer?

1045
00:51:33.013 --> 00:51:34.124
Yes.

1046
00:51:35.223 --> 00:51:37.524
What do I do now?

1047
00:51:37.754 --> 00:51:40.663
How did things turn out like this?

1048
00:51:41.893 --> 00:51:43.323
Why do you live like this?

1049
00:51:43.863 --> 00:51:45.794
My goodness.

1050
00:51:45.794 --> 00:51:46.834
(Writer Kwon)

1051
00:51:47.433 --> 00:51:49.203
- Didn't I tell you that... - Be quiet.

1052
00:51:53.473 --> 00:51:56.743
Hello, Hye Jin.

1053
00:51:57.143 --> 00:51:59.113
Of course.

1054
00:51:59.473 --> 00:52:02.743
I'll be right there.

1055
00:52:06.953 --> 00:52:08.484
I'm going on a date with her.

1056
00:52:11.694 --> 00:52:13.823
What is he thinking?

1057
00:52:14.163 --> 00:52:15.363
I have no idea.

1058
00:52:16.723 --> 00:52:19.263
I wonder how Dong Gu and Yoon Ah are doing.

1059
00:52:19.464 --> 00:52:21.703
What if he's giving her a hard time?

1060
00:52:21.904 --> 00:52:23.033
I wonder.

1061
00:52:24.933 --> 00:52:26.104
Blow your nose.

1062
00:52:26.933 --> 00:52:28.904
Do it harder.

1063
00:52:28.904 --> 00:52:30.174
Blow your nose.

1064
00:52:31.913 --> 00:52:33.714
Gosh, it's dirty.

1065
00:52:34.783 --> 00:52:38.183
Yoon Ah, let me tell you again.

1066
00:52:38.183 --> 00:52:40.113
- I don't bother... - Stop it.

1067
00:52:40.183 --> 00:52:41.283
Okay.

1068
00:52:46.723 --> 00:52:50.064
Why is your face so dirty?

1069
00:52:50.663 --> 00:52:54.303
Now that Sol is gone, I have a big baby.

1070
00:53:03.904 --> 00:53:05.044
This is it.

1071
00:53:05.513 --> 00:53:07.143
This is my house.

1072
00:53:07.143 --> 00:53:08.584
I see.

1073
00:53:09.044 --> 00:53:11.854
It's late. You should get some rest.

1074
00:53:13.183 --> 00:53:15.053
I don't want to say goodbye.

1075
00:53:16.183 --> 00:53:18.124
Do you want to come in and have some tea?

1076
00:53:18.493 --> 00:53:19.624
Tea?

1077
00:53:19.723 --> 00:53:22.763
No way. It's okay.

1078
00:53:23.223 --> 00:53:25.263
You must be tired. Go and rest.

1079
00:53:25.263 --> 00:53:26.564
It's fine.

1080
00:53:26.893 --> 00:53:28.033
Come in.

1081
00:53:28.033 --> 00:53:29.203
- Come on. - No.

1082
00:53:29.203 --> 00:53:30.464
Wait. Hold on.

1083
00:53:41.419 --> 00:53:42.589
Pardon me.

1084
00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:44.530
- This is my house. - I see.

1085
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:49.930
Goodness.

1086
00:53:53.959 --> 00:53:57.429
I'll leave after one cup of tea.

1087
00:53:57.528 --> 00:53:58.898
Okay.

1088
00:53:59.568 --> 00:54:02.168
Please wait here. I'll bring some coffee.

1089
00:54:02.168 --> 00:54:03.269
Okay.

1090
00:54:20.588 --> 00:54:21.689
Who is it?

1091
00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.628
Why is he here again?

1092
00:54:24.729 --> 00:54:26.289
Hye Jin, open the door.

1093
00:54:27.758 --> 00:54:29.258
It's me. Open the door.

1094
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:32.269
- Let's talk. - I haven't told you something.

1095
00:54:32.528 --> 00:54:34.439
I was seeing someone.

1096
00:54:34.668 --> 00:54:37.068
I'll explain everything and end it.

1097
00:54:37.068 --> 00:54:38.209
Don't misunderstand, okay?

1098
00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:40.309
No, please don't do it.

1099
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:41.878
Don't do anything.

1100
00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:44.778
Hye Jin, won't you open the door?

1101
00:54:44.878 --> 00:54:46.008
I know...

1102
00:54:47.818 --> 00:54:48.948
you're inside.

1103
00:54:48.948 --> 00:54:50.648
I saw you entering the house...

1104
00:54:50.948 --> 00:54:52.349
with that jerk.

1105
00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.889
Don't worry. It won't hurt you.

1106
00:54:54.959 --> 00:54:56.088
It'll hurt me.

1107
00:54:56.088 --> 00:54:58.289
Please don't do anything. I beg you. Please.

1108
00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.758
If you insist on behaving this way,

1109
00:55:00.358 --> 00:55:02.459
I'll just have to open the door myself.

1110
00:55:02.659 --> 00:55:05.198
Don't open the door. Please don't. Don't open it.

1111
00:55:13.838 --> 00:55:16.108
Hold on. What on earth do you think you're doing?

1112
00:55:16.809 --> 00:55:18.548
Gosh. You reek of alcohol.

1113
00:55:18.749 --> 00:55:20.048
Have you been drinking again?

1114
00:55:20.079 --> 00:55:21.349
That's right. So what?

1115
00:55:21.778 --> 00:55:24.019
Anyway, where's that jerk?

1116
00:55:24.448 --> 00:55:25.588
Where is he?

1117
00:55:26.119 --> 00:55:27.488
What's wrong with you?

1118
00:55:27.488 --> 00:55:30.358
Who are you to care who I date or not?

1119
00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:32.229
Where did you hide that jerk?

1120
00:55:32.858 --> 00:55:34.398
Let me see how great he is.

1121
00:55:36.398 --> 00:55:38.369
He's in here, isn't he?

1122
00:55:38.369 --> 00:55:39.568
This is driving me crazy.

1123
00:55:40.539 --> 00:55:41.599
Open up, you jerk.

1124
00:55:42.668 --> 00:55:45.709
Open up. If you don't, I'll break in.

1125
00:55:48.939 --> 00:55:50.008
What? Where is he?

1126
00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:53.148
Come out. Come out.

1127
00:55:55.448 --> 00:55:57.818
Where do you think you're going? Stop right there.

1128
00:55:58.218 --> 00:55:59.218
Stop right there.

1129
00:56:02.488 --> 00:56:03.619
Oh, my gosh.

1130
00:56:06.959 --> 00:56:08.959
You jerk. I finally got you.

1131
00:56:09.758 --> 00:56:11.599
How dare you steal my girlfriend?

1132
00:56:11.798 --> 00:56:13.869
I've got to see what you look like with my own eyes.

1133
00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:15.698
- No. - Get this out of the way.

1134
00:56:15.698 --> 00:56:19.039
I'm telling you. Get this out of the way.

1135
00:56:19.039 --> 00:56:20.639
Gosh. Darn it.

1136
00:56:21.238 --> 00:56:22.238
What's wrong with you?

1137
00:56:23.679 --> 00:56:24.809
Open up.

1138
00:56:28.979 --> 00:56:30.019
You...

1139
00:56:31.019 --> 00:56:32.119
You scumbag.

1140
00:56:34.459 --> 00:56:35.818
Hello, director.

1141
00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.829
It's me, Lee Jun Ki.

1142
00:56:39.559 --> 00:56:42.298
What's going on? It was you who's dating Writer Kwon?

1143
00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:43.329
There's been a misunderstanding.

1144
00:56:43.329 --> 00:56:45.829
There was a car accident between her and I.

1145
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:48.468
Suddenly, she insisted we start dating. It was against my will.

1146
00:56:48.468 --> 00:56:49.898
Hold on. Please listen.

1147
00:56:49.898 --> 00:56:52.269
I don't like her.

1148
00:56:52.439 --> 00:56:54.378
She's not even my type.

1149
00:56:54.378 --> 00:56:55.439
- It's the truth. - Jun Ki.

1150
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:59.409
Writer Kwon.

1151
00:56:59.579 --> 00:57:01.448
It's not what you think. Please let me explain.

1152
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:03.249
Director. You've got it all wrong.

1153
00:57:03.249 --> 00:57:05.948
Director, so what I'm trying to say is...

1154
00:57:05.948 --> 00:57:08.019
Director. Writer Kwon. No, Writer Kwon.

1155
00:57:08.019 --> 00:57:11.559
I'm the director, you idiot. I'm the director.

1156
00:57:11.559 --> 00:57:14.028
My name is Lee Jun Ki, sir.

1157
00:57:14.198 --> 00:57:15.329
Come here, you jerk.

1158
00:57:18.099 --> 00:57:20.939
Loser. Why do you live like that?

1159
00:57:22.738 --> 00:57:25.008
How did I know something like this would happen?

1160
00:57:25.869 --> 00:57:29.409
You guys don't think I'll lose my role, right?

1161
00:57:29.409 --> 00:57:30.548
I doubt it.

1162
00:57:30.878 --> 00:57:33.878
That writer's a pro. I doubt she'd take revenge over this.

1163
00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:37.818
I'll be all right. I won't have to worry, right?

1164
00:57:37.818 --> 00:57:39.448
You'll be all right. You'll be fine.

1165
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:43.929
I'll be all right. I'll be all right.

1166
00:57:48.128 --> 00:57:49.929
Dong Gu. Are you all right?

1167
00:57:53.698 --> 00:57:55.298
You're fever's getting higher.

1168
00:57:55.468 --> 00:57:57.168
I'm all right.

1169
00:57:57.168 --> 00:57:59.668
I'm sure I'll feel better after I get some sleep.

1170
00:58:16.918 --> 00:58:19.159
What are you doing up?

1171
00:58:19.628 --> 00:58:21.258
I have some studying to do.

1172
00:58:26.068 --> 00:58:29.738
You still want to become a pastry chef?

1173
00:58:29.968 --> 00:58:32.639
Yes. After all, it's my dream.

1174
00:58:33.778 --> 00:58:37.309
And for Sol's sake, I won't give up.

1175
00:58:37.448 --> 00:58:39.309
You sure are stubborn.

1176
00:58:41.519 --> 00:58:43.789
Yoon Ah. Could you please pass me my cell phone?

1177
00:58:47.258 --> 00:58:48.258
Hello?

1178
00:58:49.918 --> 00:58:50.959
What?

1179
00:58:51.329 --> 00:58:54.499
I don't need a loan. I've already got one to repay.

1180
00:58:54.499 --> 00:58:55.898
Yoon Ah. Just hang up.

1181
00:58:55.898 --> 00:58:57.668
Don't those people even sleep?

1182
00:58:57.968 --> 00:58:58.968
Gosh.

1183
00:59:01.599 --> 00:59:03.909
Dong Gu. Who's this?

1184
00:59:06.068 --> 00:59:07.409
That's my mom.

1185
00:59:07.508 --> 00:59:09.238
My goodness. She's beautiful.

1186
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:13.648
I don't think I've ever heard you mention your mother.

1187
00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:17.349
She passed away.

1188
00:59:20.048 --> 00:59:22.059
I see.

1189
00:59:26.358 --> 00:59:29.559
What type of person was she?

1190
00:59:29.729 --> 00:59:30.798
My mom?

1191
00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:35.168
She was stubborn, had a temper,

1192
00:59:35.168 --> 00:59:36.769
and she sure did nag a lot.

1193
00:59:37.039 --> 00:59:39.838
Like you, if she had her mind set on something,

1194
00:59:39.838 --> 00:59:42.108
she would never give up.

1195
00:59:42.939 --> 00:59:46.048
I got a good beating a lot when I was young.

1196
00:59:47.048 --> 00:59:48.948
She must've been tough lady.

1197
00:59:48.948 --> 00:59:50.889
She had a soft heart though.

1198
00:59:51.648 --> 00:59:55.519
She would stay up taking care of me and applying medicine on my wounds.

1199
00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.959
Don't you miss her?

1200
01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:04.099
Of course I do.

1201
01:00:05.298 --> 01:00:06.898
I want to see her so much,

1202
01:00:07.939 --> 01:00:09.298
but I can't now.

1203
01:00:14.338 --> 01:00:16.039
You cough is getting worse.

1204
01:00:17.278 --> 01:00:18.548
Get some sleep, Dong Gu.

1205
01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.409
I think I should.

1206
01:00:44.439 --> 01:00:45.709
What is this?

1207
01:00:49.878 --> 01:00:51.479
Why is this here?

1208
01:00:55.648 --> 01:00:57.648
Could she have possibly...

1209
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.358
Gosh.

1210
01:01:13.099 --> 01:01:14.999
I must've dozed off.

1211
01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:21.079
I wonder if his fever has gone down.

1212
01:01:25.508 --> 01:01:26.979
It's gone down.

1213
01:01:28.179 --> 01:01:29.479
That's a relief.

1214
01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:39.628
Dong Gu. Are you asleep?

1215
01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:47.168
Dong Gu.

1216
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:58.378
That's better.

1217
01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:00.918
I nearly died.

1218
01:02:05.218 --> 01:02:06.218
Oh, dear.

1219
01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:12.159
It stinks.

1220
01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.829
Did you miss me, Sol?

1221
01:02:18.028 --> 01:02:20.429
I missed you, Sol.

1222
01:02:20.429 --> 01:02:22.099
I missed you so much.

1223
01:02:22.999 --> 01:02:25.869
I'm sure you guys had a hard time looking after her. I'm sorry.

1224
01:02:26.068 --> 01:02:28.338
That's all right. Don't worry about it.

1225
01:02:29.878 --> 01:02:31.979
It's starting. Jun Ki's drama's about to begin.

1226
01:02:33.209 --> 01:02:34.318
Don't watch it.

1227
01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:36.179
Please don't watch it.

1228
01:02:36.179 --> 01:02:38.488
Why? It's your debut drama. We should see it.

1229
01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.418
- Where's the remote? - There he is.

1230
01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.159
We've arrived, Chairman.

1231
01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:44.189
He's on.

1232
01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:46.128
I won't let them get away with this.

1233
01:02:46.559 --> 01:02:48.159
How dare they try to take away my job?

1234
01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.468
I'll show them who they're dealing with at today's board meeting.

1235
01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:53.499
Mr. Kim.

1236
01:02:53.499 --> 01:02:54.599
Would you like a piece of candy?

1237
01:02:54.599 --> 01:02:55.599
Where did that come from?

1238
01:02:55.599 --> 01:02:56.668
- Thank you, sir. - Don't eat that.

1239
01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:10.179
What's going on? Was it the candy?

1240
01:03:11.548 --> 01:03:13.988
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim!

1241
01:03:14.519 --> 01:03:16.488
It's a shame he died that way.

1242
01:03:16.488 --> 01:03:17.789
Forgive me, Mr. Kim.

1243
01:03:18.588 --> 01:03:21.099
There's nothing we can do. We should move on quickly.

1244
01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:23.298
Go ahead and look for a new driver, Mr. Han.

1245
01:03:23.298 --> 01:03:24.429
- Yes, sir. - What?

1246
01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:26.929
That's it? Your role dies after eating a candy?

1247
01:03:26.968 --> 01:03:28.198
Are you going to continue coming out?

1248
01:03:28.198 --> 01:03:29.269
No.

1249
01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.909
That writer sure can hold a grudge.

1250
01:03:32.168 --> 01:03:34.008
How could she get rid of a character like that?

1251
01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:39.778
Hey. Where were you?

1252
01:03:39.778 --> 01:03:41.278
Jun Ki's drama was just on.

1253
01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:44.218
I saw it on my cell phone. He died after eating a candy.

1254
01:03:45.019 --> 01:03:46.048
Jun Ki.

1255
01:03:46.148 --> 01:03:48.588
What kind of candy was it? Was it a mint candy?

1256
01:03:50.689 --> 01:03:52.358
What is that important?

1257
01:03:52.459 --> 01:03:55.459
That's right. It was a mint candy. It was a mint candy. Are you happy?

1258
01:03:55.459 --> 01:03:56.459
Really?

1259
01:03:57.329 --> 01:04:00.769
You should blame the candy. Why are you taking it out on me?

1260
01:04:05.068 --> 01:04:07.238
Yoon Ah. This is for you.

1261
01:04:07.479 --> 01:04:08.508
What is this?

1262
01:04:08.508 --> 01:04:10.579
You said you want to become a pastry chef, right?

1263
01:04:10.979 --> 01:04:13.679
You're always studying that book about baking at home.

1264
01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:15.448
Do you think that'll help you become an actual pastry chef?

1265
01:04:15.448 --> 01:04:17.019
You need to go to an institute to prepare to get a license.

1266
01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:19.088
I know that, but I can't afford to attend an institute.

1267
01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.249
This won't cost you anything.

1268
01:04:20.889 --> 01:04:23.718
I found out there's a system that financially supports single moms.

1269
01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:25.689
- Really? - Yes.

1270
01:04:25.689 --> 01:04:27.459
I also did some research...

1271
01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:29.599
and found out there are some good institutes in the area.

1272
01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.668
Let's go and apply for the subsidy tomorrow...

1273
01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:32.999
and check out the institutes.

1274
01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:36.369
Thank you, Dong Gu.

1275
01:04:36.499 --> 01:04:38.139
There you go again.

1276
01:04:38.668 --> 01:04:40.979
Stop shedding tears so easily.

1277
01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.349
Thank you, Dong Gu.

1278
01:04:47.749 --> 01:04:50.349
What wrong with you? Why are you blushing?

1279
01:04:51.689 --> 01:04:55.189
I'm not blushing.

1280
01:04:55.519 --> 01:04:57.789
She's suffocating me. That's all.

1281
01:04:58.659 --> 01:05:00.358
Why hug me all of a sudden?

1282
01:05:00.858 --> 01:05:02.258
You sure are strange.

1283
01:05:02.659 --> 01:05:04.968
Look at you. You're even stuttering.

1284
01:05:05.298 --> 01:05:06.329
What's going on?

1285
01:05:06.329 --> 01:05:08.439
Have you grown fond of her after spending a few days...

1286
01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.709
- on the roof together? - What are you talking about?

1287
01:05:11.068 --> 01:05:12.838
It's nothing like that!

1288
01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:18.778
Gosh.

1289
01:05:18.909 --> 01:05:20.008
He's acting strange.

1290
01:05:20.648 --> 01:05:22.579
Let's watch something else. He died. Why watch this?

1291
01:05:26.488 --> 01:05:28.718
Nonsense. Why would I grow fond of her?

1292
01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:31.758
Gosh. Why on earth did I blush?

1293
01:05:32.588 --> 01:05:33.758
No way.

1294
01:05:35.559 --> 01:05:37.599
That's impossible.

1295
01:05:38.128 --> 01:05:39.568
It can't be.

1296
01:05:59.699 --> 01:06:03.139
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1297
01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:04.608
We're taking the same course.

1298
01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:06.409
He said he was going this way, so he gave me a ride home.

1299
01:06:06.409 --> 01:06:07.779
He seems like a great guy.

1300
01:06:07.779 --> 01:06:09.378
He's good-looking, and he's gentle.

1301
01:06:09.378 --> 01:06:10.478
You should consider dating him.

1302
01:06:10.478 --> 01:06:12.318
How would you know if he's a great guy?

1303
01:06:12.318 --> 01:06:13.719
There's something strange about the look in his eyes.

1304
01:06:13.818 --> 01:06:15.148
Yoon Ah. Watch out for him.

1305
01:06:15.148 --> 01:06:16.418
Dong Gu. Do you have feelings for Yoon Ah?

1306
01:06:16.418 --> 01:06:17.489
Would you like to appear in my movie?

1307
01:06:17.489 --> 01:06:19.858
The innocent and glamorous Shin Soo Jung?

1308
01:06:19.858 --> 01:06:21.088
I'll go it. I'll do the bed scene!

1309
01:06:21.088 --> 01:06:23.088
You promised to lose 20 pounds in one week?

1310
01:06:23.088 --> 01:06:24.159
Ask Seo Jin for help.

1311
01:06:24.159 --> 01:06:25.699
Run Faster.

1312
01:06:25.699 --> 01:06:26.798
Bed scene!

1313
01:06:26.898 --> 01:06:28.199
I won't allow you to walk!

1314
01:06:28.798 --> 01:06:31.298
Shin Soo Jung! Bed Scene!

1315
01:06:31.298 --> 01:06:33.268
You'll die at this rate, Jun Ki.

1316
01:06:33.369 --> 01:06:35.268
Hi. I'm here to collect the rent.

1317
01:06:35.268 --> 01:06:38.708
These will be put up for auction to cover overdue rent and interest.

1318
01:06:38.739 --> 01:06:40.849
Do you want to close your business or get married?

1319
01:06:41.079 --> 01:06:42.148
- A wedding? - A wedding?

1320
01:06:42.148 --> 01:06:44.849
The famous singer Whee Sung agreed to sing at the wedding?

1321
01:06:45.619 --> 01:06:48.489
- Kiss the bride! - Kiss the bride!

1322
01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:50.148
Kiss the bride!

1323
01:06:50.659 --> 01:06:51.688
Dong Gu.

1324
01:06:51.759 --> 01:06:54.259
I don't know what to do, Dong Gu.
