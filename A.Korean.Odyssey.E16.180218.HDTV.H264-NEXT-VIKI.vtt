18
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.220
<i>- Why would you miss me?
- Because I love you this annoyingly!</i>

19
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.390
<i>I love you, Jin Seon Mi.</i>

<i>- What is this?!
- Geumganggo.</i>

21
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.770
<i>You came to save me?</i>

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.720
<i>No. I came to eat you.</i>

<i>You finally appear now, Fairy?</i>

25
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.910
<i>If you call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger,</i>

26
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.520
<i>I will always appear and protect you.</i>

27
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.650

28
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.030

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.950
<i>This baby's blood will save people.</i>

31
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.730
<i>What you're seeing right now is the birth of Sam Jang.</i>

32
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.460
<i>So you're the guardian who will protect Sam Jang this time.</i>

33
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.610
<i>I wanted to show you the beginning of a new Sam Jang.</i>

34
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.870
<i>Since I want you to protect this child until the end.</i>

35
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.190
<i>Don't ever let go.</i>

36
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.180
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to remove the Geumganggo.

37
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.270
You know I don't want it removed.

38
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.610
I'm giving you a chance to run away from me.

39
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.940
I don't want to.

<i>[Episode 16]</i>

41
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.550
Can I bring him his meal?

42
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.660
Oh. A white heron has visited Suruemdong...

43
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.700
- Don't do it.
- I will do it.

44
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.840
Why? Are you afraid you'll kill me?

45
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.290
Yes. I can't protect you any other way.

46
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.840
So you laid inside the coffin with the lid closed? Are you an idiot?

47
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.850
Yes. I am an idiot. You jerk!

48
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.810
I didn't do that.

49
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.770
Did I?

50
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.900
I did this?

51
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.250
No matter how angry I was, would I have broken this?

52
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.500
Only the valuable ones were broken.

53
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.950
I have this kind of power?

54
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.830
Since when?

55
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.100
When Ah Sa Nyeo went in and left your body,

56
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.760
did she leave some of her powers behind?

57
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.740
Did she?

58
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.140
But then again, I remember everything from when she was here.

59
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.780
She didn't drink any wine here and you didn't light the candles, right?

60
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.400
That's right. You remember everything!

61
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.290
Also...

62
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.210
- You took the drug.
- That's ri...

63
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.430
No.

64
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.000
It's true, but it's not like that.

65
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.540
To my man... That wench...

66
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.410
Woah. You're cool!

67
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.080
Yeah. I think I've become a bit cooler.

68
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.370
I lost it this time.

69
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.110
Oh Jeong worked hard to prepare this, and it's become a mess.

70
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.810
I know. He decorated it prettily.

71
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.820
It's a shame.

72
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.530
You know...

73
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.390
it turns out we aren't a match made in heaven.

74
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.050
That bell... was a death bell.

75
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:55.670
Coming back to see you was too scary and painful for me.

76
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.410
Even now?

77
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.490
I know why you were trying not to come out of there.

78
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.280
I wanted to protect you in my own way.

79
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.610
Since I had no power of any kind.

80
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.240
What do you mean no power? You're Sam Jang.

81
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.050
Since you're a special Sam Jang, you're able to kill the great me.

82
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.940
From now on, I'm going to be on alert while figuring out how you might be able to kill me.

83
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.370
And I'm going avoid it well so that I don't die.

84
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.610
So don't be scared.

85
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.990
Okay. Don't ever die because of me.

86
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.880
Right now, I feel like I'm going to die because of you.

87
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:53.140
Ending my first night with you just sleeping, it's so unfair I could die.

88
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.000
You smiling like that, you're too adorable.

89
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.580
Huh? Stop smiling. It's really killing me.

90
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.010
This won't do.

91
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.050
If I stay here with you, I'll die from anxiousness.

92
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.130
I'll take you home. Come.

93
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.350
How did I break this?

94
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.460
Has Sam Jang left?

95
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.990
Yeah. What are you doing here?

96
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.720
I was looking around the garden while dropping off your meal.

97
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.360
If you brought food you should bring it in. Why are you pulling out weed?

98
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.520
There isn't even much grass.

99
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.670
But it seemed like I shouldn't come in.

100
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.960
Nothing happened that you shouldn't come in.

101
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.610
Since you're here, clean the room in Sureumdong.

102
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.260
Yes. I will clean it.

103
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:27.460
By the way, Hyungnim, a white heron came by Sureumdong.

104
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.280
- A white heron?
- Yes.

105
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.970
It came into Sureumdong?

106
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.860
Then it can't be an ordinary winged animal.

107
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.810
Probably so.

108
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.290
<i>It's the birth of Sam Jang.</i>

109
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.330
The one that showed me something like that earlier...

110
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.640
was it that thing?

111
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.030
What did you see?

112
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.050
Oh. She said it was the birth of Sam Jang.

113
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.740
But it's strange.

114
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.410
I was told that she became Sam Jang as a punishment for freeing me.

115
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.740
But what's the birth about?

116
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.680
Just as you heard, she must have been Sam Jang since birth.

117
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.900
Then it's even more strange.

118
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.340
You said it was a white heron...

119
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.370
What was it that was shown to me?

120
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.920
I hear a baby's cry.

121
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.650
That's right. I heard a baby's cry before.

122
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.020
I really hear it.

123
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.420
It's a real baby.

124
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.750
The white heron must have brought it.

125
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.010
In just one night,

126
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.790
You had a baby?

127
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.920
I told you that's not it.

128
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.100
The white heron left it in the Suremdong garden.

129
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.770
But the thing is, this baby...

130
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.150
Why does it resemble you?

131
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.920
Does that make sense? How could that happen in one night?

132
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.840
And yesterday, because of the drug I shared with Ah Sa Nyeo, I slept the whole time.

133
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.780
Oh, that's right. What happened to her?

134
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.520
Ah, I lost Ah Sa Nyeo.

135
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.760
You lost her? You did? How did that happen?

136
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.700
I've gotten weaker.

137
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.760
It's that bad?

138
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.690
That's right. And I still have side effects.

139
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.130
I've been struck by a chill, too. Oh, so cold!

140
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.630
Now I'm a bull without horns.

141
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.180
I'll catch her. Ma Wang, go rest until your horns grow back.

142
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.610
They'll grow back, so don't worry.

143
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.630
Whoa, the baby. Hey, you need to take the baby!

144
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.750
What am I supposed to do with this child?

145
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.090
He always brings bothersome things and leaves them with me.

146
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.800
Ah, seriously!

147
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.490
If Son Oh Gong catches Ah Sa Nyeo, he'll find out that you let her go on purpose.

148
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.330
<i>Do you think Princess Iron Fan's child died?</i>

149
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.690
Until I find out whether Ah Sa Nyeo is telling the truth, I'm going to keep her alive.

150
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.360
That cunning thing created a seed of useless doubt in your mind.

151
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.590
The suspicion could become truth.

152
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:14.110
Even if small, there's still a chance that the child could still be alive.

153
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.190
Until my suspicions are confirmed, I can't trust anyone.

154
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.520
Even the Great Sage?

155
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.820
That's right, even that guy.

156
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.320
I have to be suspicious of everything.

157
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:37.540
Did you also... come to deceive me?

158
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:45.730
You dare try to bewitch me with that face. You have no chance.

159
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.140
I'm Ma Wang!

160
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.700
Peek a boo! Aigoo, you're holding my hand?

161
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.810
Hey, Secretary Ma, go buy a rattle. I'm going to do whatever he wants.

162
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.010
Aigoo, you're smiling. Aigoo, is that so? What are you doing? Hurry up and go buy it!

163
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.810
Aigoo, you're so cute. Even your hand is cute. Aigoo, you're smiling.

164
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.480
How long do I have to wait?

165
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.460
I think we need to talk.

166
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.650
There are a lot of things I'm curious about.

167
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.170
What are you curious about?

168
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:36.390
About what you are, and what you can do. There are a lot of things I want to know.

169
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.790
If I were to tell you about all of that, it would be tiring.

170
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.680
Should I take care of the thing that the kid next to you is worried about?

171
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:05.440
She says she needs to get rid of the person who knows about Akiko.

172
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.640
<i>Ceramic ware, Potter Craftmanship meet</i>

173
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.210
For helping me keep my family problems from becoming public.

174
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.150
I'm thankful for that.

175
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.660
Your great-grandfather who we thought was an independence fighter

176
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.970
received a Medal of Honor from the Emporer of Japan... I was shocked as well.

177
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.380
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

178
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.190
<i>Letting the past be undisturbed is preferable.</i>

179
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.830
Please promise me that I will have a definite position.

180
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.890
When you enter politics,

181
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:54.260
if your family's pro-Japanese past is revealed, then it will become a stumbling block.

182
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.780
Stumbling blocks should be removed. Let's talk over a cup of tea.

183
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.700
I have a treasure to show you as well.

184
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.360
This was discovered at a construction site.

185
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.630
It's an old sarcophagus.

186
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:30.620
About what I am, and what I can do for you... have I answered it somewhat?

187
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.700
You take care of the clean-up. I'll be leaving.

188
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:59.510
Ah Sa Nyeo's sarcophagus was uncovered on the land owned by the Korean Foundation belonging to Kang Dae Seong.

189
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:04.180
He must have her coffin. Then did she go there?

190
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.420
Kang Dae Seong is not an ordinary person.

191
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.080
In a few years it's believed that he will be the country's top personage.

192
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.530
Okay.

193
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:21.830
<i>Even in this world, I'm going to call a dragon again.</i>

194
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.620
<i>And so, I'm going to make a king.</i>

195
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:31.950
She said that when she was in Sam Jang's body. Did she choose that person?

196
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.860
Anyway, there's a good chance that she's near that person.

197
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.880
It's a notification for a group chat.

198
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.600
I haven't had any contact lately. Huh?

199
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.680
- What is it?
- Bu Ja has sent a greeting to the group chat.

200
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.110
What?

201
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.600
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

202
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.050
Hi? What kind of nonsense is this?

203
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.800
Aigoo, you're so pretty. You're so pretty.

204
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.280
<i>A text message has arrived.</i>

205
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.450
Wait a moment.

206
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.590
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

207
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.080
<i>Even if I don't introduce myself, I'm sure you know who I am.</i>

208
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.780
Her mental state passes. It's quite strong.

209
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.730
<i>But still, for those who might be confused, I am Ah Sa Nyeo.</i>

210
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.180
I don't think she's normal.

211
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.950
<i>If you know where Son Oh Gong is, message me.</i>

212
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:50.350
<i>If not, tell him where I am.</i>

213
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.800
If this thing is calling me out, then she has something she's counting on.

214
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.320
<i>[If you know where Son Oh Gong is, message me.]</i>

215
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.250
Evil wench.

216
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:20.150
The wind... where did it suddenly blow from?

217
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.860
The wind?

218
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.500
CEO, are you going to meet Chief Son?

219
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.570
Yes, I plan to.

220
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:40.260
Umm, CEO, it's because I just can't stop myself from asking and wondering,

221
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.500
but the people close to Secretary Son,

222
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.990
are they involved in making these kinds of things?

223
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.250
So you saw. A person close to him is connected to it.

224
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.410
No wonder. No wonder.

225
00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.830
I thought our Secretary Son was unusually glitzy.

226
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.690
CEO, you're really amazing.

227
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:08.440
I salute you! I truly salute you! You even got a ring.

228
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.350
Then, are you moving into a chaebol mansion?

229
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.240
Oh, you don't have the ring.

230
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.520
Ah, it was taken off.

231
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.590
Then the night you were dragged off, did you get an envelope of money thrown at your face

232
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.920
and slapped with a glass of water like this?

233
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.560
Is there a lot of opposition?

234
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:40.390
Yes. The opposition from up there is really severe.

235
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.390
- You're not going?
- Yes, I don't think I need to go. Go back to work.

236
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.220
This can't be a good place to die.

237
00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.020
This is a good place for a date.

238
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.980
I found it while surfing the web.

239
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.510
It's really convenient these days.

240
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.350
Yes, then just conveniently surf the web and do some shopping, too.

241
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.480
Input "coffin" in the search bar. A coffin.

242
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.000
Or do you want to reuse your coffin again?

243
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.250
I guess you're not in the mood for a date.

244
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.110
If I had known, when we were together that time,

245
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.690
I would've drank the wine and had you light the candles.

246
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.270
Then the moment I took the drug would've been romantic.

247
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.060
I'll put scented candles and wine in your coffin.

248
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.530
You shouldn't be like this to me.

249
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.490
Sam Jang will be in danger.

250
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.510
When I was in Sam Jang's body, I ate something dangerous.

251
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.120
What dangerous thing?!

252
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.120
Hey! That day, you had a bowl of Ox head rice soup that

253
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.600
Lee Han Joo bought at the market with two hoddeok (<i>pancake stuffed with brown sugar</i>) and you ate ice cream.

254
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.970
I told you I was watching you.

255
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.360
I guess you didn't know Yook Gong was there.

256
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.890
Why? Is that what you were counting on?

257
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.780
How disappointing.

258
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.490
I won't lay a finger on Sam Jang ever again.

259
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.730
So that you can't lay a finger on Sam Jang again, I'll put you in your coffin.

260
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.700
I'm not kidding. Let's go.

261
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.660
Ma Wang is the one who let me go.

262
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.560
I promised to help him.

263
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.490
You said Ma Wang let you go?

264
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.290
Yes. I let her go.

265
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.370
Yes. I let her go.

266
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.100
So you let her go this time too.

267
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.810
So Ma Wang really was the one you were counting on?

268
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.190
This time around, it's a little more plausible.

269
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.120
I told her I will rip her to shreds and kill her.

270
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.690
I'm keeping her alive because she is useful.

271
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:07.450
If she is of no use, I will hand her over to you.

272
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.890
Fine. Let me hear what you have to say.

273
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.900
See you next time.

274
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.440
Just so you know, I don't think I will pay here again.

275
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.600
Know that and get out of here.

276
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.340
Ma Wang, please pay.

277
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.130
I've been deceived all this time. Jingle Jingle like a dog.

278
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.160
I realized I could be a sucker.

279
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.780
I think Ah Sa Nyeo is deceiving you with her stupid talk.

280
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.380
In order to keep me submissively tame,

281
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.310
the heavens deceived me about my child and said nonsensical stuff.

282
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.710
Ah yah ah yah.

283
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.530
Ah Sa Nyeo is the one speaking nonsense to use you!

284
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.930
My child was alive but they did it from me.

285
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.080
You've watched too many dramas.

286
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.080
The child lived but did they kill it?

287
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.630
Out of the melodrama has it become a thriller?

288
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.340
I must avenge my son.

289
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.490
Ma Wang, give it a rest!

290
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.640
Why? I don't know whether my son is alive or dead.

291
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.230
What rest?/ What is the truth? (<i>T.N. Korean pun... "jinjeong" means both rest and truth)</i>

292
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.710
The baby's waking up. You guys argue quietly.

293
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.820
The more I think about it the more I'm suspicious.

294
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.910
First of all, it hasn't been confirmed yet whether Princess Iron Fan saved the child!

295
00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.130
They can't fool you unless the child was saved!

296
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.070
Shhh!

297
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.690
So I'm going to order Ah Sa Nyeo to confirm it.

298
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.890
Aigoo, of course.

299
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:02.220
Ah Sa Nyeo has really bewitched you with that hidden baby talk.

300
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.720
You think you'd be any different?

301
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.370
It's about child. A child!

302
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.180
What's so great about a child, huh?

303
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.700
Let's see. Hey, peek-a-boo.

304
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.390
Are you laughing at me?

305
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.830
Hey, hey. Do peek-a-boo one more time.

306
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.420
Why should I?

307
00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.520
The baby stopped crying. Do peek-a-boo once more.

308
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.890
I don't want to.

309
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.600
You don't like peek-a-boos? Then do this.

310
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.830
That's even more strange. I don't want to!

311
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.550
Fine then. Then say okay, okay and do this.

312
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.360
- Do that at least.
- Are you nuts?! I won't!

313
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.300
Hey, but the baby loves it. Do it just once!

314
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.590
Get in.

315
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.450
- To go where?
- Keep your last promise.

316
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.650
If I say I don't want to?

317
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.050
I can make you very famous.

318
00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.420
Within the 30 seconds I get out and seat you in here,

319
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.810
you'll become famous.

320
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:09.710
If you plan to go around doing bad things, you can't be known, no?

321
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.570
Where did she go without paying?

322
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.360
Wait!

323
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.470
Go in.

324
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.170
Let Bu Ja fulfill her wish of seeing her mom.

325
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.700
If I go in and don't even shed one tear,

326
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.230
wouldn't that woman be hurt?

327
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.470
That won't happen. She is unconscious.

328
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.830
Bu Ja...

329
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.570
I mean, she became more ill while looking for Jeong Se Ra.

330
00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:59.460
To the point of collapse, she'd only been looking for her daughter.

331
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.290
I'm too busy to bother myself with these types of things.

332
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:22.600
This girl's body is very weak. I'm barely able to hang on.

333
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.870
Do you know how I'm hanging on?

334
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.020
You should know. How a corpse keeps from rotting.

335
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.790
You also once tried to catch her and let this girl feed on her.

336
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.790
I'm very busy trying to sustain this body.

337
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.150
If you want to help, then you, too,

338
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.080
catch some humans for me.

339
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.810
Has Bu Ja become... a monster?

340
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.280
Aigoo, you did?

341
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.750
You're really good at babysitting. But I wonder what this is.

342
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:07.590
You brought the baby, so how should I know? You said a white heron dropped it off.

343
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.880
Do you know anything about Jin Seon Mi's early years by any chance?

344
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.790
When you put her in the Five Elements Mountain, how did you find her and put her in there?

345
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.310
Did someone give you a clue?

346
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:19.360
Oh no. I found her while looking for special humans.

347
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.310
- She was very famous already.
- Jin Seon Mi was?

348
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.370
That's why Jonathan is trying to make a movie about her, too.

349
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:30.060
Have you not seen the news article on Wooja?

350
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.010
Wooja was based on Seon Mi's life.

351
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:39.010
A long time ago, a mysterious epidemic wiped out an entire village.

352
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:45.600
Amongst those who died was a pregnant woman who, just before she died, gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

353
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.270
That girl was Seon Mi.

354
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.710
She was scorned and ostracized by everyone around her because they thought she was cursed.

355
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:11.050
But I believe she saved each and every one of them.

356
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.140
What makes you say that?

357
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.420
After she was born, the epidemic ended.

358
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.430
I learned all of this from a doctor I met at a health clinic while doing research.

359
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.120
A doctor?

360
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.680
<i>What you're seeing right now is the birth of Sam Jang.</i>

361
00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:42.340
<i>I wanted to show you the beginning of a new Sam Jang.</i>

362
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.450
I should go see that doctor too.

They're still adorable even when they drool.

And even if they poop buckets, they're still cute.

Ah Sa Nyeo could have said it to deceive me.

But, you know, from the moment I heard that the child could be alive,

375
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:49.340
I keep desperately wanting more and more for that to be true.

I know. Oh, peek-a-boo!

379

If the child is alive, I can forgive them even if they fooled me for a thousand years.

In order to save the child that was born to that woman and me,

I committed the sin of catching a human to be feed on.

that I didn't have a chance to think about the dead child.

Didn't she say she was going out to look for a sword?

I have the ability, you see?

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.790
Stop slacking off with that ability and do your job at the shop selling.

Stop the nagging. We don't even have any customers.

Why did you send it without checking?

444
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.020
I was supposed to be sending it anyway, so...

445
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.700
I'll find it for you. I'll make sure.

446

Excuse me. This might sound odd...

456
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.540
It's not. It's not!

457
00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.520
It's not, right? Aigoo, and here I thought.

458
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.260
I thought you were here to show her that you were a married man with a child.

459
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.640
What?

460
00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.900
Didn't you and the CEO decide to break up because your family opposed the marriage?

461
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.850
Who told you that?

462
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.720
Then why did you take back the ring?

463
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.440
Oh, the ring. I need to get that back again.

464
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.210
You're going to get it back?

465
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.180
Of course you should.

466
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.580
Should I make you some premium coffee perhaps?

467
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.700
Never mind that. Just watch the kid.

468
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.380
If he cries, you just need to do peek a boo. Only if he cries.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.290
Ah, what a relief.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.110
It's not like you did anything.

472
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.250
My Grandmother is coming back.

473
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.150
I need to put back all the money I took before then.

474
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.350
Where has she gone away to for so long?

475
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.240
I don't know. She said she was going to look for a sword.

476
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.330
A sword? What kind of sword takes that long to find?

477
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.330
I know.

478
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.770
It's since the day that Noona came here and the ill omen jar broke, so...

479
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:04.780
It's been quite awhile. It must be an important item.

480
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.920
An ill omen jar...

481
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:19.040
<i>I saw the world being destroyed.</i>

482
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.490
She saw that here, right?

483
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.180
The Geumganggo came from here also.

484
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.620
And what is this about a sword...?

485
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:39.660
Hey, contact me first when your Grandmother returns.

486
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.640
Okay.

487
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.060
Really,

488
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.440
I give you credit for your mental ability and guts.

489
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.360
Seeing that you came here without being called.

490
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.170
Since you're my backer.

491
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.150
If you really want to keep me as your backer,

492
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:06.830
then find me proof that what you told me is true.

493
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:12.070
Since you won't believe me, I'll find you proof.

494
00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.510
Give me a little time.

495
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.740
Whose baby is this?

496
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.350
It's not. It doesn't even look like me. What's wrong with everyone?

497
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.230
Then why do you have this child with you?

498
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.620
I'm going to return the baby.

499
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.250
- Let's go together.
- Where is it?

500
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.300
Where you were born.

501
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.720
- Why there?
- Someone called.

502
00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.520
Let's go and hear how you began.

503
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:55.050
It might be that your fate was sealed even before we met.

504
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.630
Since you were born.

505
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.900
I was very unlucky since the day I was born.

506
00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:04.960
My parents died as well as a lot of the villagers.

507
00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.490
People were scared that I was an ominous kid and didn't like me.

508
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.630
The reason my uncle avoids me is for the same reasons.

509
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.920
I know.

510
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.510
Let's go and find out again.

511
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:23.690
Whether Jin Seon Mi truly is an ominous child.

512
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.380
- This is...
- I know. It's where you were born.

513
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.690
And it's a place my parents as well as the villagers,

514
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.200
where a lot of them died.

515
00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.680
Let's go in.

516
00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.720
Thank you for safely bringing back the child.

517
00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:26.120
You went through a lot, baby.

518
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:30.850
It's not time for you to be born yet, but I made you travel.

519
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.400
Jin Seon Mi, you've grown up a lot.

520
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.010
I was here, too, when you were born.

521
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:46.710
Pardon? But you look so young...

522
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.890
You're not human, are you?

523
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:58.220
That's right. The one who called for me to come here with you is her.

524
00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.680
I'm a white heron.

525
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.780
Do you know me?

526
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.950
I know your grandmother well.

527
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:10.220
She treasured her special granddaughter.

528
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.360
Really?

529
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.950
But what's the reason you called me here?

530
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:22.810
I wanted to let you know that you're not an ominous child at all.

531
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.730
<i>The infectious disease that suddenly appeared spread like wildfire.</i>

532
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:41.090
<i>Since it was a small village, this place overflowed with patients.</i>

533
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.830
<i>Those who got infected died very quickly,</i>

534
00:46:43.854 --> 00:46:46.654
<i>And this place endured it.</i>

535
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.980
<i>There was a pregnant woman close to her due date among the patients.</i>

536
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:58.330
<i>I felt it since that person came. That a baby, who will save people will be born.</i>

537
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:06.610
<i>The mother died but the baby was born safely.</i>

538
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.600
<i>And the blood of that baby saved others.</i>

539
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.040
<i>The disease disappeared in an instant.</i>

540
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.160
No one knows this.

541
00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.990
But you saved people since the moment you were born.

542
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.310
Sam Jang.

543
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.000
I saved them?

544
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.680
Your fate was sealed since you were born.

545
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.160
Of course, the lotus scent of your blood probably started

546
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:42.650
after you met your guardian.

547
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:47.350
But... how did you know all this?

548
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:54.590
Since a long time ago,

549
00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.970
I had been waiting for Sam Jang to be born.

550
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.110
Thank you for telling me.

551
00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.280
I was an ominous child,

552
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.170
so I was worried everyone around me would be harmed.

553
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.010
But since you're telling me that's not true, it's comforting.

554
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.490
Whatever you go through in the future,

555
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:27.010
it'll probably result in saving, not harming.

556
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.190
Thank you for bringing her here.

557
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:46.200
I've never walked on this road feeling happy.

558
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.780
I was always alone.

559
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.190
If not, the kids used to throw rocks at me.

560
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:54.220
Are you happy now?

561
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.990
First of all, my fate isn't your fault.

562
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:04.130
Then no matter what happens to me it's not your fault, so I'm happy.

563
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.520
You're not scared now?

564
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:15.790
No. I feel like I'm a little more great person, and I'm less scared because it gives me strength.

565
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:19.540
When I become stronger, I won't be scared. Like you.

566
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:23.130
When did I say I wasn't scared? I feel like I'm going to die because I'm so scared over you.

567
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:28.660
You said I was your only weakness, right? I don't like that.

568
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.410
I'm going to become much more strong,

569
00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.010
and take this off for you.

570
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:40.840
If I'm not pretty at all after you take this off, then run away.

571
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:47.390
But if I'm even a little bit pretty, I'll hold onto you tight then.

572
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.540
Let's go.

573
00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:04.200
But I guess my grandma knew you'd come.

574
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:10.090
When I talked about the fairy, she always told me he'd be back.

575
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:14.530
That doctor said your grandma was close to her, right?

576
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:15.990
Yeah.

577
00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.780
Son Oh Gong. I'm sure there are things you're still curious about.

578
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.750
I'm sorry. You should have gone home first.

579
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.240
No, it's okay. I was about to leave.

580
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.630
- Huh? You found it.
- What?

581
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.320
The ring.

582
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.730
Secretary Son gave it back to you, didn't he?

583
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.120
You see, I told him off earlier.

584
00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:02.410
No matter how strong the opposition is, you have to push through it with love!

585
00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.140
Let's go!

586
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.340
<i>Let's go.</i>

587
00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:18.480
He gave it to me then...

588
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:37.210
You came back.

589
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.280
Since I didn't get to hear anything you wanted to tell me.

590
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:52.130
You're right. I have something to tell you.

591
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:56.150
- Since you're Sam Jang's guardian.
- What are you exactly?

592
00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:01.110
Like you, I'm also a guardian who used to protect the last Sam Jang.

593
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:09.540
Before the disarrangement of the world comes, they said Sam Jang would appear.

594
00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.340
I'm sure Jin Seon Mi isn't the first. What else?

595
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.680
Soon, a sword will appear.

596
00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.430
With that sword, you'll end up stabbing Sam Jang.

597
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:28.240
<i>Just like how I did a long time ago.</i>

598
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.630
<i>[Kang Dae Seong announces his plans to enter politics]</i>

599
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.980
<i>[Kang Dae Seong announces his plans to enter politics]</i>

600
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.750
<i>[Kang Dae Seong announces his plans to enter politics]</i>

601
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.730
<i>[Kang Dae Seong announces his plans to enter politics]</i>

602
00:52:55.730 --> 00:53:00.230
An enormous evil spirit will appear which the world's wickedness created.

603
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:04.660
Sam Jang will pay for that with her life.

604
00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:09.020
- That's the end of Sam Jang's calling.
- And then what happens?

605
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:17.310
Your job is to stab Sam Jang with the sword issued to you and kill her along with the evil spirit and end the world's disarrangement.

606
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.230
That's how it's been written...

607
00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.920
and why the death bell rang...

608
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.510
What's the reason you called me to tell me this?

609
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.160
I have something to request of you.

610
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:41.850
When the sword is given to you, help me so that I can die.

611
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:51.900
Without that, it's too painful for me to endure this long life alone.

612
00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:03.220

620
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.970
Thanks to you, an obstacle on my path has disappeared.

621
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.680
There are more things I can do.

622
00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:02.790
Among those things you can do, by chance, does it include calling a dragon to crown a king?

623
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:09.780
So you... want to become the king.

624
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:16.180
Then first, there's someone you have to meet.

625
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:19.560
Who?

626
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.440
There's a woman whose strength we need

627
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.940
in order to fulfill your wish. Make her yours.

628
00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.230
Then I will have to meet her.

629
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.520
You will see her soon.

630
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.550
You said you look after Jeong Se Ra's mother, right?

631
00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:41.700
I'm helping her since she's in dire need.

632
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.860
Since I made the mistake, I have to take good care of her.

633
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:48.350
Helping the mother of a woman you killed...

634
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.530
You'll surely become a wicked king.

635
00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.740
This girl's mother...

636
00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:35.670
You're not happy to see me anymore?

637
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.630
I don't want to have awful thoughts when I see you. I don't want to see you anymore.

638
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:46.740
Jeo Pal Gye, I went and saw her mom.

639
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.960
Don't listen to her. Let's go, Pig.

640
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.330
Thanks to you, I fulfilled this girl's desperate wish.

641
00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:00.570
Thank you.

642
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:06.310
You're trying to use me again?

643
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:07.850
Yes.

644
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:11.090
I have a request.

645
00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:13.690
Let me meet with Sam Jang.

646
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.660
You're really only meeting her for a second to talk to her, right?

647
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:31.160
If it becomes dangerous and the Great Sage comes, you're dead.

648
00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.160
I know that too well.

649
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.620
I'm not the one who's going to meet her.

650
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:40.200
Then who are you having her meet?

651
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.730
Are you okay?

652
00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.470
Something seems wrong.

653
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:26.240
Yeah. I'm okay.

654
00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:30.680
But... it's a little strange.

655
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.450
Oh, Grandma. You're back.

656
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:42.240
Yes. I was gone for too long, right?

657
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:49.290
What is it? You took that long looking for this?

658
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.140
It's for an important day.

659
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.000
The sky is acting up today.

660
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.990
Those no good... They must be up to something.

661
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:16.800
Even if the heavens fooled you,

662
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.670
you mustn't act in haste.

663
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:23.400
You've lost a lot of your power at the moment.

664
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.980
I know. I've become weaker, indeed.

665
01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:33.650
I have no energy to go and turn everything upside down. But,

666
01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.660
very simply,

667
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.700
I have a way to become stronger than before.

668
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.230
- What...
- Sam Jang.

669
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:47.050
If I eat her, that'll do it.

670
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:51.360
But... the Great Sage...

671
01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.450
We just need to take off the Gunganggo.

672
01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:57.090
Once we remove the Gumganggo I found,

673
01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:59.330
we can remove him from

674
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.750
Sam Jang's side.

675
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:12.730
If they fooled me for a thousand years,

676
01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:17.150
what is there that I can't do?

677
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:24.420
Earlier, I saw the same thing that I saw when the ill omen jar broke.

678
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:29.440
To be honest, I see the future once in a while.

679
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:33.160
I guess you really are becoming stronger.

680
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:37.880
It feels like something that's meant to happen is coming closer.

681
01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:42.050
There's something I didn't tell you.

682
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:45.260
The doctor we met with,

683
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:49.840
she was a guardian of another Sam Jang. Like you and me.

684
01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.840
Really? So what happened?

685
01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.140
The two of them

686
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.730
did their jobs so well

687
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:06.690
that they got greatly rewarded and became deities and are living happily ever after.

688
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:11.360
Wow. That's great.

689
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:13.510
Then I'll become a deity, too?

690
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.530
Becoming deity is not the problem.

691
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.250
Make sure you ask for what you want when the chance comes.

692
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:22.120
They told me they'd give me an official position but locked me up in the peach field.

693
01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:23.760
The heavens are very childish, you see?

694
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.540
Peach field?

695
01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.760
Oh, the place where your popularity exploded among the fairies?

696
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.750
The group fight?

697
01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.890
Let's forget about that.

698
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:43.530
Anyway, that's how we'll become.

699
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:46.590
Right. Let's become like that.

700
01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.470
But if...

701
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:54.120
one disappears and one ends up alone,

702
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.580
then I think being the one left behind would be sadder.

703
01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.970
It would be more painful.

704
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:06.660
The longer the years left to live is.

705
01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:26.710
You don't want to live happily forever with me?

706
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.120
Well... I'm thinking about doing nothing and jobless.

707
01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.230
Should I tell Oh Jeong to save a position for you?

708
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:37.420
No. I have a lot of money. You just have fun.

709
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.590
Fine. I'll just have fun.

710
01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.930
But for now, there's something we have to do.

711
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:49.020
We need some winning spirit.

712
01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.010
When I'm scared, having difficulty, and it's dangerous,

713
01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:06.220
I'll call on Jin Seon Mi.

714
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.230
I'll be going.

715
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:44.630
It's the sword to be used on that day.

716
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:49.570
You've worked hard.

717
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:53.520
I've done my duty.

718
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.280
Finally, Sam Jang's sword has arrived!

719
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.480
The sword of Sam Jang is here with us again?

720
01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.450
The disarrangement will soon appear.

721
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:28.180
Is that it?

722
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.910
This is...

723
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:38.720
Great Sage!

724
01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.530
It's not yet for you to have.

725
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.840
You're going to give it to me anyway.

726
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:49.380
- You knew?
- A white heron came by at Sureumdong.

727
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:56.450
That sword can never be destroyed.

728
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:59.090
For your duty,

729
01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:02.400
Sam Jang will be sacrificed, and that deed,

730
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.940
Great Sage, you will carry it out with that sword!

731
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.980
But don't worry.

732
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:15.690
The moment you carry out that duty, Geumganggo will disappear,

733
01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:20.340
and you will be able to stab Sam Jang without any pain.

734
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:24.860
After that, the painful punishment that was given to you

735
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.400
will all end.

736
01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:32.790
Load of crap.

737
01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:44.700
Now, the sword has been handed over to the guardian!

738
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.220
What is that punk going to do by taking that?

739
01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.260
You found it.

740
01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.950
Then please lend me that sword

741
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:21.300
so that I can die as promised.

742
01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:30.890
You're wearing a Geunganggo.

743
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:39.670
Then... even if you're left behind like me in this world alone,

744
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.190
you will be able to escape this suffering.

745
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:48.610
Because I'm wearing this,

746
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:51.040
what pain is like after it disappears,

747
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:55.270
how big it will be, I can't guess at it.

748
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:58.390
I'm more fearful of that.

749
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:02.910
Don't... end up like me.

750
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.570
I'll never be like that.

751
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.420
Now, I want to end this already.

752
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:49.860
If that sword is gone, will Sam Jang be safe?

753
01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:55.270
Probably. But that will never disappear.

754
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:59.060
What if Son Oh Gong doesn't use that sword?

755
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.190
If he's to protect Sam Jang without that sword,

756
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:06.880
the Great Sage will have to put his life on the line.

757
