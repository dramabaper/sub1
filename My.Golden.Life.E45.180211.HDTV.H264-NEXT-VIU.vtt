1
00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:11.056
You...

2
00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:15.027
should get married.

3
00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:28.447
If Ji An wants to be a contemporary arts artist,

4
00:00:28.747 --> 00:00:30.547
I'll open a gallery for you.

5
00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:32.646
You can be the head of a gallery after the wedding.

6
00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:36.286
Do Kyung should come back to the company.

7
00:00:45.327 --> 00:00:47.426
This is as far as I can yield.

8
00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.566
Why won't you answer me, Ji An?

9
00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:58.236
I'm confused.

10
00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:00.977
Confused?

11
00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:05.476
This is just so sudden.

12
00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:07.247
That explains why she's flustered.

13
00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:12.986
I'd understand if you're surprised, but flustered?

14
00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:17.896
Are you surprised since you never thought of this?

15
00:01:20.627 --> 00:01:22.396
I see. That must have been it.

16
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.167
But Ji An, as you know,

17
00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:28.836
his grandfather is infuriated with Do Kyung.

18
00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:31.836
You don't need to tell Ji An about him.

19
00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:34.807
Do Kyung, listen to your mother.

20
00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:39.077
We approve this marriage only because of him.

21
00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:42.747
Do Kyung must return to work as soon as possible.

22
00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:46.956
But to let him accept you, Ji An,

23
00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:48.926
you need to at least look the part...

24
00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:50.586
given our family's reputation too.

25
00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:53.426
Luckily, since you wanted to go to an art school,

26
00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:55.627
I thought it wouldn't be a bad change for you too.

27
00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:06.807
I'll pretend that I didn't hear you say you hated...

28
00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:08.907
our family as you felt intimidated.

29
00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:17.886
Is three years too long for you to stay apart?

30
00:02:18.217 --> 00:02:19.786
We'll give some thought to your offer separately...

31
00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:21.326
and will give you our answers then.

32
00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:26.726
Separately? Why would you do that?

33
00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:30.627
To us, this isn't simple.

34
00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:33.066
- Do Kyung. - You're dating...

35
00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:36.367
only for a week. How many days are left?

36
00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:39.076
We have four days left.

37
00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:42.147
Then you will give us your answers after four days.

38
00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:59.557
(Episode 45)

39
00:03:09.207 --> 00:03:10.266
Are you okay?

40
00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:12.437
I'm fine.

41
00:03:13.237 --> 00:03:16.177
Dad's presence tells me that they are serious.

42
00:03:17.147 --> 00:03:18.416
This is quite perplexing.

43
00:03:18.877 --> 00:03:20.217
It's the last thing I expected.

44
00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:22.816
I know.

45
00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.766
Have you lost your mind?

46
00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:41.066
No Myung Hee.

47
00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:44.377
Did you just say you'll let Ji An marry Do Kyung?

48
00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.576
I don't have any choice to bring back Do Kyung.

49
00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:52.946
He's trying to go head to head with Dad like a kid.

50
00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:56.446
But I don't believe you'll let them off this easily.

51
00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:59.487
And do you think you can persuade your father?

52
00:04:00.617 --> 00:04:02.127
They can't marry right now.

53
00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:05.256
After getting him accept them and Ji An's studies,

54
00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:07.157
they will get married then.

55
00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:10.497
Do Kyung would've proven himself after three years.

56
00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:14.337
Dad can't reject them without a good reason.

57
00:04:14.907 --> 00:04:17.136
Haesung must be very important to you.

58
00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:19.177
However,

59
00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:22.377
he said she's not the only reason for not returning.

60
00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:25.747
And Ji An said she didn't want to join our family.

61
00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:28.117
Do you believe what she said?

62
00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:31.617
They are dating now.

63
00:04:32.316 --> 00:04:35.127
- What? - I caught them dating.

64
00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:37.956
They said they're dating only for a week.

65
00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:40.756
Do you think they can break up afterward?

66
00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:42.826
They are dating only for a week?

67
00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:46.566
Yes. According to them, it's strictly just dating.

68
00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:49.466
Strictly dating.

69
00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:53.477
If that's the case, we can't intervene.

70
00:04:54.307 --> 00:04:58.076
What our family is worried about is the marriage.

71
00:04:59.747 --> 00:05:02.586
That's why you must help me.

72
00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:06.256
You know that I wanted to open up a gallery.

73
00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:10.127
She will look respectable if she manages it.

74
00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:14.696
Truthfully, she was smart, adequately educated,

75
00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:17.597
diligent, driven, and has the gumption too.

76
00:05:18.037 --> 00:05:20.336
There's nothing wrong with her.

77
00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:23.766
I'm sure she will take good care of Do Kyung too.

78
00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:27.307
What do you need me to do?

79
00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:30.877
Help me persuade them.

80
00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.747
Since we can't tell Dad about them right now,

81
00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:36.446
we should persuade them so they follow our lead.

82
00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:43.886
Imagine if Dad really gives up on Do Kyung.

83
00:05:43.987 --> 00:05:45.627
Is that what you want?

84
00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:49.367
What if Do Kyung regrets his decision later on?

85
00:05:49.927 --> 00:05:53.466
We must protect our oldest as his parents.

86
00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:06.977
Thanking us would have been a good start.

87
00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:10.487
They are more circumspect than I thought.

88
00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:13.586
They had been pretending not to be involved.

89
00:06:14.487 --> 00:06:17.127
They must be embarrassed to accept it right away.

90
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.266
But you...

91
00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:30.566
did like art, didn't you?

92
00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:37.506
Couldn't it be a sculpture gallery?

93
00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:40.446
If I agree to go abroad for my studies,

94
00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:42.747
would you return to work?

95
00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:46.156
If we are together.

96
00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:51.196
No, forget it. That's a bit rash.

97
00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:53.727
This isn't an easy decision to make.

98
00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:55.627
I was too hasty.

99
00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:06.177
I came here because my mother has asked for me.

100
00:07:06.537 --> 00:07:08.177
My name is Choi Eun Seok.

101
00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:11.646
She introduced me as her daughter,

102
00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:13.847
but I'll be her daughter-in-law?

103
00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:19.417
Are you thinking about what my parents said?

104
00:07:20.316 --> 00:07:23.727
No way. I don't want to think about that.

105
00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:28.367
Yes, think about nothing today.

106
00:07:28.896 --> 00:07:30.266
Let's think about it later.

107
00:07:43.807 --> 00:07:46.117
It's been a while. Welcome.

108
00:07:46.977 --> 00:07:49.847
Yes, you're right. It's been a while.

109
00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:52.487
- Do you have the draft? - Yes, it's right here.

110
00:07:52.617 --> 00:07:54.156
I sent the quality test result...

111
00:07:54.156 --> 00:07:56.256
and finished the list of necessary preparations.

112
00:07:56.256 --> 00:07:57.627
I just need you to look them over, sir.

113
00:07:57.627 --> 00:07:58.627
Put them in my office.

114
00:07:58.627 --> 00:07:59.997
- I'll read them later. - Yes, sir.

115
00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:01.696
Come this way.

116
00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:05.537
Wooden bedding pellets for pets.

117
00:08:05.696 --> 00:08:07.396
You must know. You told me about this.

118
00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:09.607
I only thought it'd be used for fuel only.

119
00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.836
I haven't seen these in person.

120
00:08:13.537 --> 00:08:16.477
Our products are free of adhesive, pollutant,

121
00:08:16.477 --> 00:08:19.016
nontoxic, and completely organic.

122
00:08:19.276 --> 00:08:21.386
We're using only the inner parts without the skin,

123
00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:22.987
so that we'll introduce the best product.

124
00:08:25.557 --> 00:08:28.287
I was interested in eco-friendly products.

125
00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:30.896
With right marketing, it will make good money.

126
00:08:30.896 --> 00:08:31.997
What about the distribution?

127
00:08:32.227 --> 00:08:34.296
I'll distribute free samples...

128
00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:36.426
to pet shops, vet clinics, and cat cafes first.

129
00:08:36.827 --> 00:08:38.097
Will you sell them online?

130
00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:39.436
But do you have someone to market them?

131
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:42.006
We're only a small factory that just opened.

132
00:08:42.107 --> 00:08:44.107
I have to do the marketing and sales by myself.

133
00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.276
After we pass the test and list our trademark,

134
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:49.877
we're starting then, so I'll wrap samples tonight.

135
00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:52.676
I haven't seen you this excited before.

136
00:08:53.146 --> 00:08:54.416
Do I seem excited?

137
00:08:55.146 --> 00:08:56.447
Is it because it's my first business?

138
00:09:01.487 --> 00:09:02.727
This is my office.

139
00:09:08.697 --> 00:09:10.097
But what are these?

140
00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.567
Those are wrappers for our product.

141
00:09:13.367 --> 00:09:15.207
They are just plastic bags.

142
00:09:15.506 --> 00:09:16.936
They are too plain.

143
00:09:18.406 --> 00:09:20.136
I was going to put our logo on here.

144
00:09:20.337 --> 00:09:23.447
No way. Packaging plays a big part.

145
00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:25.977
I'll design for the packaging.

146
00:09:26.276 --> 00:09:28.587
- I took a class about it. - Is that so?

147
00:09:29.317 --> 00:09:31.186
I was going to ask you to do something else.

148
00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:33.156
Something else? What is it?

149
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.926
I was going to order cat toilets from you.

150
00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:37.697
I want you to design them.

151
00:09:37.727 --> 00:09:41.197
Right. It's an official order for Ms. Seo Ji An.

152
00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:43.097
Accepted.

153
00:09:51.607 --> 00:09:53.276
This is what you want, right?

154
00:09:56.176 --> 00:09:58.947
I didn't know you were good at drawing too.

155
00:10:00.877 --> 00:10:02.286
I can make this for you.

156
00:10:02.947 --> 00:10:04.386
Tell me about your marketing strategy.

157
00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:06.717
(Marketing Strategy)

158
00:10:07.217 --> 00:10:09.686
Your marketing strategy is not bad,

159
00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:12.097
but people use social media a lot these days.

160
00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:15.766
Secretary Yoo and I don't know much about it.

161
00:10:15.926 --> 00:10:17.867
You saw it first hand from the anniversary event.

162
00:10:18.136 --> 00:10:20.497
First, make an official account for the company.

163
00:10:20.497 --> 00:10:22.867
Upload videos or posts to promote your product.

164
00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.977
After that, recruit testers on that account.

165
00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:26.707
To participate,

166
00:10:26.707 --> 00:10:29.776
the applicants can upload a post to promote them.

167
00:10:30.747 --> 00:10:32.717
The applicants' friends will read the post,

168
00:10:32.817 --> 00:10:34.347
so our product can be promoted in multiple ways.

169
00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:37.957
Exactly. And put a lot of hashtags with pound.

170
00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:40.987
Like "Wood pellet", "pellets for pets",

171
00:10:40.987 --> 00:10:43.186
"cats", "100 percent eco-friendly", and so on.

172
00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:44.526
Use important keywords.

173
00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:47.156
You'll understand better with some examples.

174
00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.266
Hey. Stay focused.

175
00:11:10.117 --> 00:11:12.117
You were the one who wanted to come here.

176
00:11:13.087 --> 00:11:15.926
Why did Father ask Ji An to meet?

177
00:11:18.026 --> 00:11:19.756
Was he trying to help her?

178
00:11:20.497 --> 00:11:23.097
Or did he scold her?

179
00:11:23.997 --> 00:11:27.636
Why isn't she calling me?

180
00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:32.077
You're unbelievable, Ji Soo.

181
00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:34.377
What?

182
00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:35.646
She will call you when she has the time.

183
00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:37.306
How many times do I have to repeat?

184
00:11:37.617 --> 00:11:40.717
Who do you like? Me or Ji An?

185
00:11:42.087 --> 00:11:43.146
What?

186
00:11:43.317 --> 00:11:44.857
Why do you keep talking about Ji An...

187
00:11:44.857 --> 00:11:45.987
when you're here with me?

188
00:11:45.987 --> 00:11:47.016
Hey,

189
00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:49.357
it's not like I was talking about another man.

190
00:11:49.357 --> 00:11:51.556
I was talking about Ji An. What's wrong with you?

191
00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:54.597
You sound as if you are jealous.

192
00:11:54.597 --> 00:11:57.367
Why? Can't I get jealous of a girl?

193
00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:04.636
Ji Soo,

194
00:12:05.077 --> 00:12:08.006
from this time and forth, only think about me.

195
00:12:10.077 --> 00:12:11.646
Okay. I will.

196
00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:15.046
Here. Eat it.

197
00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:18.217
- Is it good? - It's good.

198
00:12:18.217 --> 00:12:19.686
Is it?

199
00:12:20.457 --> 00:12:21.857
Come on and eat.

200
00:12:22.056 --> 00:12:23.127
Okay.

201
00:12:24.656 --> 00:12:25.656
Enjoy.

202
00:12:25.656 --> 00:12:26.926
- Thank you. - Thank you.

203
00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:30.296
You got side dishes delivered?

204
00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:32.997
Not many restaurants do delivery service here.

205
00:12:32.997 --> 00:12:35.406
This is easy and convenient.

206
00:12:35.806 --> 00:12:37.266
This is better than eating out.

207
00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:38.906
It's like a home-cooked meal.

208
00:12:38.906 --> 00:12:40.337
Let's eat.

209
00:12:40.337 --> 00:12:41.377
Okay.

210
00:12:47.317 --> 00:12:48.686
I'm full.

211
00:12:49.447 --> 00:12:51.256
I've been really hungry.

212
00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:53.756
I will go get coffee.

213
00:12:57.756 --> 00:12:59.796
He could get an upset stomach.

214
00:13:00.627 --> 00:13:03.026
Gwan Woo is quick-witted.

215
00:13:03.197 --> 00:13:05.666
He's a keeper.

216
00:13:07.737 --> 00:13:09.567
You must enjoy your work.

217
00:13:09.737 --> 00:13:10.766
What?

218
00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:13.406
You've been really happy since you got here.

219
00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:14.546
Have I?

220
00:13:14.707 --> 00:13:16.977
It's even more fun to talk about work with you.

221
00:13:17.107 --> 00:13:19.477
I enjoyed working with you in the marketing team.

222
00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:21.617
It will be fun if we run a business together.

223
00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.627
But...

224
00:13:29.256 --> 00:13:32.656
I guess that's not the work you enjoy.

225
00:13:33.697 --> 00:13:35.296
What you do well...

226
00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:37.367
is different from what you enjoy.

227
00:13:45.176 --> 00:13:46.276
(Ji Soo)

228
00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:48.707
Why did Father ask you to see him?

229
00:13:48.707 --> 00:13:50.107
I am dying to know.

230
00:13:51.776 --> 00:13:52.877
Who is it?

231
00:13:53.546 --> 00:13:55.786
I have to do my homework.

232
00:13:55.786 --> 00:13:57.516
I should eat and go.

233
00:13:58.156 --> 00:14:00.357
Take your time. I will take you home.

234
00:14:06.327 --> 00:14:07.597
I'll say bye here.

235
00:14:08.396 --> 00:14:10.296
I don't want to be the girlfriend...

236
00:14:10.296 --> 00:14:12.597
who asks her super-busy boyfriend to drive her.

237
00:14:12.997 --> 00:14:15.607
I heard you have to work all night to pack samples.

238
00:14:15.607 --> 00:14:17.067
Go back inside.

239
00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:18.806
I will bring the design tomorrow after work.

240
00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:19.837
Bye.

241
00:14:21.176 --> 00:14:23.546
Don't run. You might fall.

242
00:14:41.697 --> 00:14:43.097
You also think...

243
00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:46.436
she doesn't actually mean it.

244
00:14:47.197 --> 00:14:50.036
She even threatened me to go study abroad...

245
00:14:50.036 --> 00:14:52.506
just to save her face.

246
00:14:52.536 --> 00:14:54.607
Seo Hyun told me this once.

247
00:14:54.607 --> 00:14:57.817
She said keeping the face is all they care about.

248
00:14:58.176 --> 00:14:59.717
It's especially true for Grandfather.

249
00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:01.617
Besides,

250
00:15:02.487 --> 00:15:04.386
I was once introduced to very important people...

251
00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:06.317
as Choi Eun Seok.

252
00:15:07.317 --> 00:15:10.426
Right. That's why they dressed me up as you...

253
00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:12.127
to introduce me to people.

254
00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:15.967
It seems like Do Kyung doesn't have a clue.

255
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.896
They are so unbelievable.

256
00:15:19.536 --> 00:15:21.067
All you want to do...

257
00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:23.506
is to date for just a week.

258
00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:26.207
And they are still making it hard.

259
00:15:27.747 --> 00:15:29.906
You must've felt so sad.

260
00:15:31.776 --> 00:15:32.977
But Ji Soo,

261
00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:35.886
for a short moment,

262
00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:39.617
I thought about...

263
00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:42.386
what if she really meant it.

264
00:15:43.727 --> 00:15:44.957
What if she means it?

265
00:15:45.457 --> 00:15:46.697
Are you willing to become their daughter-in-law...

266
00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:48.827
after studying abroad?

267
00:15:48.827 --> 00:15:50.936
No. That's not it.

268
00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.766
I just...

269
00:15:54.967 --> 00:15:58.107
thought it would be nice if I can be with him.

270
00:15:58.977 --> 00:16:00.237
That's all.

271
00:16:13.286 --> 00:16:16.656
Why do they bring me so many things every time?

272
00:16:32.577 --> 00:16:33.737
What's this?

273
00:16:41.786 --> 00:16:43.947
Dad, are you surprised?

274
00:16:43.947 --> 00:16:45.457
I made this.

275
00:16:45.457 --> 00:16:46.686
Didn't I do a good job?

276
00:16:47.357 --> 00:16:50.286
Because you are still young at heart,

277
00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:52.156
I put jeans and a t-shirt on you.

278
00:16:52.896 --> 00:16:54.526
Ji Soo, Ji Tae, Ji Ho,

279
00:16:54.526 --> 00:16:56.166
Mom, and I.

280
00:16:56.997 --> 00:16:59.197
While taking care of us,

281
00:16:59.197 --> 00:17:01.306
you had forgotten about your hobby,

282
00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:03.367
and I want to congratulate you on getting it back.

283
00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:06.077
From your loving daughter, Ji An.

284
00:17:13.676 --> 00:17:16.216
How did she make it so well?

285
00:17:18.857 --> 00:17:20.787
She was born with the talent.

286
00:17:21.656 --> 00:17:23.386
And I didn't get to give her a proper training.

287
00:17:31.567 --> 00:17:33.367
(Pumpkin porridge)

288
00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:38.307
My gosh. Why does she keep making food I can't eat?

289
00:17:42.607 --> 00:17:45.347
(Tae Soo)

290
00:17:45.347 --> 00:17:46.877
Dear Tae Soo.

291
00:18:01.627 --> 00:18:04.396
Are you okay, Soo A? Do you want me to go in?

292
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:05.797
I am okay.

293
00:18:13.037 --> 00:18:14.946
It's been this tough for you all along.

294
00:18:15.807 --> 00:18:17.377
I didn't know anything,

295
00:18:17.377 --> 00:18:18.976
and I still asked you to have the baby.

296
00:18:20.077 --> 00:18:21.117
Don't say that.

297
00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:25.617
It's so fascinating.

298
00:18:26.656 --> 00:18:27.726
What is?

299
00:18:28.186 --> 00:18:31.156
In the beginning, I felt a little nauseous.

300
00:18:31.156 --> 00:18:32.857
But I didn't suffer from morning sickness.

301
00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.966
But after I decided to have the baby,

302
00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:38.236
I got the morning sickness for the first time.

303
00:18:42.367 --> 00:18:43.936
I think the baby knew.

304
00:18:44.877 --> 00:18:46.877
He knew that I didn't want him.

305
00:18:48.107 --> 00:18:49.307
What are you...

306
00:18:52.176 --> 00:18:53.646
He knew.

307
00:18:55.117 --> 00:18:56.416
He feels relieved now,

308
00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:57.886
so he's letting me know that he's there.

309
00:18:58.216 --> 00:18:59.416
Really?

310
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.027
It feels so strange, honey.

311
00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:08.226
Don't say that.

312
00:19:16.507 --> 00:19:18.337
What are you making today?

313
00:19:18.337 --> 00:19:20.206
It's an authentic French bread.

314
00:19:20.607 --> 00:19:21.706
By the way, sir,

315
00:19:21.706 --> 00:19:22.807
is it delicious...

316
00:19:22.807 --> 00:19:24.877
when it only takes flour, water, and salt to make?

317
00:19:25.216 --> 00:19:28.486
When you eat it, you will be surprised.

318
00:19:28.486 --> 00:19:29.646
The more you chew it,

319
00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:30.817
the more flavorful it will be.

320
00:19:31.156 --> 00:19:32.416
You will keep wanting more.

321
00:19:32.416 --> 00:19:35.426
When did you learn to make French bread?

322
00:19:35.426 --> 00:19:38.057
In the past,

323
00:19:38.057 --> 00:19:39.396
I sold bungeoppang in front of a French bakery.

324
00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:42.067
The baker, I mean the patissier...

325
00:19:42.067 --> 00:19:44.196
The patissier of that bakery taught me.

326
00:19:44.196 --> 00:19:45.297
- The patissier. - Yes.

327
00:19:45.297 --> 00:19:47.936
He used to love my bungeoppang.

328
00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:51.277
You've been through so many things.

329
00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:53.007
Well...

330
00:19:53.577 --> 00:19:56.176
- Nam Goo. Let's talk. - Yes?

331
00:19:56.277 --> 00:19:58.847
Hello, Hee.

332
00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:19.966
You know how I feel about Ji Soo.

333
00:20:19.966 --> 00:20:22.267
Do you have to teach her to bake?

334
00:20:22.837 --> 00:20:24.837
What's wrong, Hee?

335
00:20:25.936 --> 00:20:27.136
Come on.

336
00:20:27.136 --> 00:20:28.577
You know how hard it is...

337
00:20:28.577 --> 00:20:30.807
if there's an obstacle between two lovers.

338
00:20:31.047 --> 00:20:33.916
Why are you trying to become an obstacle?

339
00:20:34.646 --> 00:20:36.716
They are different from us.

340
00:20:37.686 --> 00:20:40.716
No, I know well because I've been through it.

341
00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:43.486
I know how rude and brutal...

342
00:20:43.486 --> 00:20:45.496
people with money are.

343
00:20:46.426 --> 00:20:49.297
Ji Soo's family is far richer...

344
00:20:49.297 --> 00:20:50.597
than my ex-husband.

345
00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:52.337
And they use it to their advantage.

346
00:20:53.466 --> 00:20:55.537
They are not getting married soon.

347
00:20:55.537 --> 00:20:57.936
And they got the permission to date.

348
00:20:59.037 --> 00:21:02.007
Hyuk is not someone who dates lightly...

349
00:21:02.176 --> 00:21:03.946
and changes fast.

350
00:21:04.377 --> 00:21:06.017
Am I doing this because I don't like Ji Soo?

351
00:21:07.146 --> 00:21:08.617
You should date and marry someone...

352
00:21:08.847 --> 00:21:10.787
who is similar to you.

353
00:21:11.456 --> 00:21:13.156
You don't know how it is.

354
00:21:13.416 --> 00:21:15.027
Family background or environment...

355
00:21:15.156 --> 00:21:17.127
doesn't easily change.

356
00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:20.996
Yes, I don't know.

357
00:21:21.127 --> 00:21:23.496
I don't know because I'm an orphan.

358
00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:26.236
I don't know anything about family environment.

359
00:21:28.107 --> 00:21:29.636
I am sorry, Nam Goo.

360
00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.976
I didn't mean to offend you.

361
00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:33.736
Hee.

362
00:21:34.607 --> 00:21:35.946
Ji Soo and I...

363
00:21:36.307 --> 00:21:38.877
knew each other before we got married.

364
00:21:39.577 --> 00:21:42.547
She's the first person I accepted as my assistant.

365
00:21:42.547 --> 00:21:43.986
She's my first pupil.

366
00:21:45.686 --> 00:21:47.186
Even if we are married,

367
00:21:47.456 --> 00:21:49.426
I hope you won't cross the line.

368
00:21:50.257 --> 00:21:52.627
Are you saying Ji Soo comes before me?

369
00:21:52.627 --> 00:21:54.597
That's not what I mean.

370
00:21:56.196 --> 00:21:58.736
You just yelled at me.

371
00:22:01.136 --> 00:22:02.236
Wait.

372
00:22:05.507 --> 00:22:07.706
Why would she take it there?

373
00:22:09.777 --> 00:22:10.777
Before we open,

374
00:22:10.777 --> 00:22:12.976
we are going to post a few product photos...

375
00:22:12.976 --> 00:22:14.146
on your websites, so please make a few.

376
00:22:14.146 --> 00:22:15.146
Okay.

377
00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:17.186
Now, it really feels like a start.

378
00:22:17.557 --> 00:22:18.617
You are great, Mr. Choi.

379
00:22:19.617 --> 00:22:21.456
- Am I a CEO now? - Yes.

380
00:22:21.587 --> 00:22:23.226
I got promoted from vice president.

381
00:22:23.886 --> 00:22:25.456
Send me the design when it's confirmed.

382
00:22:25.456 --> 00:22:27.426
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

383
00:22:30.196 --> 00:22:33.867
He's the reason why you take care of...

384
00:22:34.367 --> 00:22:36.466
the orders so quickly, Ji An.

385
00:22:36.936 --> 00:22:38.176
I will see you tomorrow.

386
00:22:38.507 --> 00:22:39.807
See you tomorrow.

387
00:22:41.976 --> 00:22:43.507
- Take care. - Bye.

388
00:22:46.817 --> 00:22:49.646
Why did you come here? I was going to fetch you.

389
00:22:49.886 --> 00:22:52.357
I thought of an idea. I'm going to make it here.

390
00:22:52.686 --> 00:22:53.787
What are you going to make?

391
00:22:54.386 --> 00:22:56.226
This is for the foundation day event.

392
00:22:56.386 --> 00:22:58.956
We will put a cat toy in the cat toilet.

393
00:22:58.956 --> 00:22:59.956
It will be a set.

394
00:22:59.956 --> 00:23:01.226
Only the first 30 people can get it.

395
00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:02.666
What are you talking about?

396
00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:04.097
We have to go on a date.

397
00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:06.097
But this is what I wanted to do.

398
00:23:06.767 --> 00:23:09.007
I wanted to help my boyfriend...

399
00:23:09.007 --> 00:23:10.767
when he's busy with work.

400
00:23:11.837 --> 00:23:14.007
Do Kyung, you're about to open your business.

401
00:23:14.007 --> 00:23:15.547
Do you think you have time to go on a date?

402
00:23:15.547 --> 00:23:18.017
I do. We can't stay here all the time.

403
00:23:22.386 --> 00:23:24.787
Isn't it good as long as we stay in the same place?

404
00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:27.557
Today will be just like yesterday,

405
00:23:27.557 --> 00:23:29.057
and tomorrow will be just like today.

406
00:23:30.587 --> 00:23:32.557
I made this in a hurry.

407
00:23:33.057 --> 00:23:34.226
What do you think of this?

408
00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:37.426
It's lovely.

409
00:23:44.607 --> 00:23:45.676
Seung Won,

410
00:23:46.406 --> 00:23:48.146
it's my first time to get a gift like this.

411
00:23:51.577 --> 00:23:53.517
It's also my first time to prepare a gift...

412
00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:56.386
for someone who is about to die.

413
00:23:58.186 --> 00:23:59.617
I am not even his child.

414
00:24:00.617 --> 00:24:02.486
And he still worried about me.

415
00:24:03.726 --> 00:24:05.396
What are you talking about?

416
00:24:08.297 --> 00:24:09.726
Honestly,

417
00:24:10.696 --> 00:24:13.196
I thought my in-laws were my husband's family.

418
00:24:13.936 --> 00:24:15.406
I didn't consider them as my own family.

419
00:24:18.236 --> 00:24:19.736
But I guess my father-in-law...

420
00:24:20.436 --> 00:24:22.446
considered me as one of his own.

421
00:24:26.446 --> 00:24:27.916
- Sir. - Yes?

422
00:24:28.517 --> 00:24:31.557
We are planning to have a concert in spring.

423
00:24:31.817 --> 00:24:34.426
I am not good enough for that.

424
00:24:34.426 --> 00:24:36.557
You can keep practicing until then.

425
00:24:36.656 --> 00:24:37.896
It's the first week of April.

426
00:24:39.297 --> 00:24:40.627
April.

427
00:24:42.597 --> 00:24:44.297
- Excuse me. - Sure.

428
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.767
Hello?

429
00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:49.206
Father, where are you now? Are you in Jeongseon?

430
00:24:52.136 --> 00:24:53.976
Here's the receipt. Please check it.

431
00:24:53.976 --> 00:24:54.976
Okay.

432
00:24:54.976 --> 00:24:56.107
Good job.

433
00:25:03.117 --> 00:25:04.257
(Ji Tae)

434
00:25:24.476 --> 00:25:25.577
I...

435
00:25:26.577 --> 00:25:28.176
just started to become happy.

436
00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:31.716
I finally know what it means...

437
00:25:32.547 --> 00:25:34.817
to be relaxed and happy. I finally know.

438
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:36.847
If I say I will go study abroad,

439
00:25:37.216 --> 00:25:39.087
will you go back to the company?

440
00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.386
And...

441
00:25:42.257 --> 00:25:43.757
I won't go back home.

442
00:25:45.226 --> 00:25:47.426
Regardless of Ji An, I won't go home.

443
00:25:47.627 --> 00:25:48.767
I am no longer...

444
00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:53.537
Grandfather's puppy.

445
00:25:53.896 --> 00:25:56.867
I hit him twice. Then I just warned him.

446
00:25:56.867 --> 00:25:57.936
Now,

447
00:25:59.236 --> 00:26:01.077
do you think...

448
00:26:01.607 --> 00:26:04.416
I will only slap Tae Soo in the face?

449
00:26:05.446 --> 00:26:08.216
To make Grandfather accept Ji An,

450
00:26:08.686 --> 00:26:10.287
she needs the right qualifications.

451
00:26:10.547 --> 00:26:12.456
Do you not like being apart for three years?

452
00:26:15.757 --> 00:26:16.857
Three years?

453
00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:28.466
Hey, Ji Tae.

454
00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:30.267
Really?

455
00:26:31.136 --> 00:26:33.837
Okay. I will get a cab.

456
00:26:37.107 --> 00:26:38.716
Why? Do you have to go home?

457
00:26:38.777 --> 00:26:42.047
Soo A is coming back home. They had a big fight.

458
00:26:43.787 --> 00:26:45.617
Thanks to you, I saw her at the wedding,

459
00:26:45.617 --> 00:26:46.757
but I haven't seen her since.

460
00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:48.956
Is that right? Then you should go.

461
00:26:49.057 --> 00:26:50.527
But I'm taking you home.

462
00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:02.337
Thank you for taking me home.

463
00:27:02.767 --> 00:27:04.107
Thank you.

464
00:27:06.206 --> 00:27:07.337
Take care.

465
00:27:08.047 --> 00:27:09.047
You can go now.

466
00:27:09.706 --> 00:27:10.847
I don't want to go.

467
00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:14.446
I'll go now.

468
00:27:14.916 --> 00:27:16.587
Okay. Bye.

469
00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:33.166
You've been married for so long.

470
00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:35.166
I'm sorry I'm only meeting you now.

471
00:27:35.367 --> 00:27:38.706
I am sorry too. I wasn't here when you got back.

472
00:27:40.236 --> 00:27:41.347
By the way...

473
00:27:42.176 --> 00:27:45.117
We actually had a big fight.

474
00:27:45.716 --> 00:27:47.277
You knew, didn't you?

475
00:27:48.287 --> 00:27:49.347
Yes.

476
00:27:49.617 --> 00:27:51.416
Thank you for coming back.

477
00:27:51.587 --> 00:27:54.486
I made lamps for you two.

478
00:27:54.827 --> 00:27:56.357
I will bring them tomorrow.

479
00:27:57.226 --> 00:27:59.097
By the way, where have you been, Mom?

480
00:28:01.327 --> 00:28:04.767
I got a job at a grocery store as a cashier.

481
00:28:05.396 --> 00:28:06.767
You got a job?

482
00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:10.307
After what I went through with Dad,

483
00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:13.936
I realized how foolish I've been.

484
00:28:15.246 --> 00:28:17.146
Living under his protection,

485
00:28:17.246 --> 00:28:18.847
I didn't know anything.

486
00:28:19.746 --> 00:28:21.117
I am the one...

487
00:28:22.047 --> 00:28:23.587
who made Dad sick.

488
00:28:24.386 --> 00:28:26.486
- That's not true. - That's not true.

489
00:28:27.656 --> 00:28:30.327
I am so thankful...

490
00:28:31.527 --> 00:28:34.097
that you accepted me again as your mother.

491
00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:36.767
So from now on,

492
00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:41.037
I won't depend on your father or you guys.

493
00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:44.406
I am going to try making money,

494
00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:46.206
no matter how small it is.

495
00:28:47.906 --> 00:28:49.107
It's not bad.

496
00:28:49.607 --> 00:28:51.877
People live until 100, and you're still young.

497
00:28:52.246 --> 00:28:54.716
Dad will feel less pressured if you work too.

498
00:29:00.656 --> 00:29:03.726
Don't get up. Don't get up.

499
00:29:05.057 --> 00:29:06.726
You're back, Soo A.

500
00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:09.627
I am sorry, Father.

501
00:29:09.966 --> 00:29:11.097
And I...

502
00:29:11.097 --> 00:29:12.696
Soo A is pregnant.

503
00:29:16.037 --> 00:29:17.166
My goodness.

504
00:29:17.976 --> 00:29:21.146
Congratulations, Soo A. Congratulations, Ji Tae.

505
00:29:21.476 --> 00:29:24.077
Am I getting a nephew or niece?

506
00:29:25.317 --> 00:29:27.946
Father, about the gift,

507
00:29:28.186 --> 00:29:29.587
thank you so much.

508
00:29:29.986 --> 00:29:32.916
Don't say that. It's nothing.

509
00:29:32.916 --> 00:29:33.986
Don't say that.

510
00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:35.857
Have a seat, Mom, Dad.

511
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:37.797
- Take a seat, Soo A. - There's no need.

512
00:29:37.797 --> 00:29:39.257
Soo A should go upstairs and rest.

513
00:29:39.627 --> 00:29:41.767
You should go upstairs.

514
00:29:41.896 --> 00:29:43.496
Soo A looks tired.

515
00:29:43.926 --> 00:29:45.037
Every woman is like that...

516
00:29:45.037 --> 00:29:46.097
in the early stage of pregnancy.

517
00:29:46.097 --> 00:29:48.067
I can feed her well now.

518
00:29:48.466 --> 00:29:50.537
You don't have to do anything, Soo A.

519
00:29:51.476 --> 00:29:53.236
Let them go upstairs now.

520
00:29:53.837 --> 00:29:55.146
Yes. You should go up.

521
00:29:55.146 --> 00:29:57.007
I will go upstairs with her.

522
00:29:57.277 --> 00:29:58.476
We will go upstairs then.

523
00:30:06.156 --> 00:30:08.386
Have you eaten?

524
00:30:09.186 --> 00:30:10.527
I have.

525
00:30:11.297 --> 00:30:13.156
I am going back to Jeongseon now.

526
00:30:13.156 --> 00:30:17.226
Don't tell Soo A that I am sick.

527
00:30:17.327 --> 00:30:20.736
Just tell her I have work in Jeongseon.

528
00:30:21.537 --> 00:30:23.067
You're going now?

529
00:30:23.267 --> 00:30:25.607
It's tiring to travel. You should stay the night.

530
00:30:25.607 --> 00:30:27.236
Hearing me throw up and groan...

531
00:30:27.236 --> 00:30:28.847
isn't going to do Soo A any good.

532
00:30:30.077 --> 00:30:31.216
Does it...

533
00:30:31.916 --> 00:30:33.216
happen often?

534
00:30:35.946 --> 00:30:37.517
It happens sometimes.

535
00:30:48.067 --> 00:30:49.726
Do Kyung is here.

536
00:30:55.466 --> 00:30:56.936
What brings you here this early?

537
00:30:58.037 --> 00:31:00.077
Was it not even necessary to wait?

538
00:31:00.777 --> 00:31:01.807
Yes.

539
00:31:02.007 --> 00:31:03.976
I thought it'd be better to get this over with.

540
00:31:09.146 --> 00:31:12.117
First, Ji An and I are not getting married.

541
00:31:13.186 --> 00:31:14.257
Which means...

542
00:31:14.926 --> 00:31:16.527
Ji An doesn't need to go study abroad.

543
00:31:17.557 --> 00:31:19.557
And I'm not going back to the company.

544
00:31:20.327 --> 00:31:22.297
You don't want to marry Ji An?

545
00:31:23.367 --> 00:31:26.537
Do Kyung, I thought you two were quite serious.

546
00:31:26.537 --> 00:31:28.206
But you don't want to marry her?

547
00:31:29.706 --> 00:31:32.636
Are you saying you just want to date her for now?

548
00:31:33.136 --> 00:31:36.176
We'll date each other only for a week as we promised.

549
00:31:36.676 --> 00:31:39.716
Why? I already approved you to go out together.

550
00:31:39.716 --> 00:31:41.317
Do you think it was easy?

551
00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:43.587
Can't you just wait for three years?

552
00:31:43.587 --> 00:31:45.986
You wanted Ji An to study art abroad.

553
00:31:46.486 --> 00:31:48.886
Being a gallery manager after studying abroad...

554
00:31:48.886 --> 00:31:50.456
is not what Ji An wants.

555
00:31:51.726 --> 00:31:54.426
I just agreed with you back then as I believed...

556
00:31:54.426 --> 00:31:56.926
it was what she needed to do as our family.

557
00:31:57.936 --> 00:32:00.567
But things are different now.

558
00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:02.406
What's different now?

559
00:32:02.537 --> 00:32:03.666
I'm sorry to say this,

560
00:32:04.507 --> 00:32:06.906
but I think you want us to get married...

561
00:32:07.107 --> 00:32:09.507
after Ji An studies art abroad...

562
00:32:10.107 --> 00:32:13.117
just to keep Ji An and me separate for three years.

563
00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:19.416
I'd go back to the company...

564
00:32:20.117 --> 00:32:22.386
and Ji An would stay away from me that way.

565
00:32:24.297 --> 00:32:26.896
Three years is long enough to marry me...

566
00:32:27.297 --> 00:32:29.097
to someone else and get a grandchild.

567
00:32:29.827 --> 00:32:31.367
For you and Grandfather.

568
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:32.597
Do Kyung!

569
00:32:33.196 --> 00:32:35.837
How could you misconstrue your own mother like that?

570
00:32:37.307 --> 00:32:40.277
Then please let me register my marriage now.

571
00:32:43.377 --> 00:32:44.446
What?

572
00:32:46.216 --> 00:32:47.946
I'll never make it public...

573
00:32:48.517 --> 00:32:50.486
until Ji An comes back.

574
00:32:51.757 --> 00:32:54.386
Can I register my marriage first?

575
00:33:00.797 --> 00:33:02.027
I knew it.

576
00:33:03.027 --> 00:33:05.936
Why don't you say anything?

577
00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:07.537
It could be an option.

578
00:33:10.267 --> 00:33:11.807
There's...

579
00:33:11.837 --> 00:33:13.807
no secret in the world!

580
00:33:13.807 --> 00:33:15.446
How would he register a marriage...

581
00:33:15.446 --> 00:33:17.077
without having a wedding ceremony?

582
00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:19.347
No one'd find it out if they don't say anything.

583
00:33:19.577 --> 00:33:20.716
Even your father.

584
00:33:27.416 --> 00:33:28.527
I should get going.

585
00:33:29.656 --> 00:33:31.827
I'm asking you once again.

586
00:33:32.327 --> 00:33:34.867
Please leave Ji An alone.

587
00:33:36.166 --> 00:33:38.666
I'm so afraid Grandfather would destroy her...

588
00:33:39.966 --> 00:33:41.906
that I can't even stay with her.

589
00:33:44.607 --> 00:33:47.706
Do Kyung, I'm doing this for you.

590
00:33:48.547 --> 00:33:51.146
Do you really want to be discarded by Grandfather?

591
00:33:55.916 --> 00:33:58.357
Does Haesung mean nothing to you?

592
00:33:58.357 --> 00:33:59.986
Do you think it's something anyone can get?

593
00:33:59.986 --> 00:34:01.686
Why are you doing this?

594
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:10.710
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E45 My Golden Life "Get Married"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

595
00:34:15.806 --> 00:34:16.837
Myung Hee.

596
00:34:17.737 --> 00:34:19.107
You deceived me.

597
00:34:20.206 --> 00:34:22.177
I just did it for Do Kyung.

598
00:34:22.177 --> 00:34:24.076
So you used me.

599
00:34:24.976 --> 00:34:27.246
You used me to make him trust you?

600
00:34:27.246 --> 00:34:28.947
I'm Do Kyung's father!

601
00:34:29.547 --> 00:34:30.646
Myung Hee.

602
00:34:31.387 --> 00:34:32.956
Did you really have to do that?

603
00:34:32.956 --> 00:34:34.857
I just had no choice.

604
00:34:37.257 --> 00:34:38.927
What should I do to take him back?

605
00:34:57.576 --> 00:34:59.746
All right. Thank you. I'll see you next week.

606
00:34:59.746 --> 00:35:02.087
- Thank you. - Thank you.

607
00:35:02.616 --> 00:35:03.786
You're Seo Ji An, right?

608
00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:06.817
Did you submit your work to the design contest?

609
00:35:06.817 --> 00:35:07.857
Yes.

610
00:35:07.857 --> 00:35:09.686
I found your name in the list of winners.

611
00:35:10.726 --> 00:35:12.757
I submitted my work,

612
00:35:13.657 --> 00:35:15.027
but it can't be me.

613
00:35:15.027 --> 00:35:16.666
You didn't check your email yet, did you?

614
00:35:17.197 --> 00:35:18.996
No. I've been busy lately.

615
00:35:19.567 --> 00:35:20.737
Go check your email.

616
00:35:38.657 --> 00:35:41.786
(Congratulations. You won the participation prize.)

617
00:35:41.786 --> 00:35:44.456
My gosh! I can't believe this!

618
00:35:44.697 --> 00:35:45.927
My goodness.

619
00:35:47.826 --> 00:35:52.536
(Do Kyung)

620
00:36:01.677 --> 00:36:03.677
Are you happy to be here?

621
00:36:03.746 --> 00:36:05.346
Do you feel comfortable?

622
00:36:06.317 --> 00:36:07.717
I was happy.

623
00:36:08.447 --> 00:36:09.786
But it's not so good anymore.

624
00:36:10.547 --> 00:36:11.616
Why not?

625
00:36:13.016 --> 00:36:14.786
Now that I'm dying,

626
00:36:14.927 --> 00:36:16.587
my children keep bothering me.

627
00:36:17.087 --> 00:36:18.357
They keep visiting me...

628
00:36:18.357 --> 00:36:20.056
and texting me every day.

629
00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:22.467
We did the same thing.

630
00:36:22.726 --> 00:36:24.666
We regretted a lot...

631
00:36:24.766 --> 00:36:26.496
when our parents died.

632
00:36:27.536 --> 00:36:28.907
I thought they were doing it...

633
00:36:28.907 --> 00:36:31.576
just to take a load off their mind.

634
00:36:31.907 --> 00:36:33.277
You feel weak now.

635
00:36:34.547 --> 00:36:36.146
My own children.

636
00:36:36.976 --> 00:36:38.476
I was going to forget everything...

637
00:36:39.146 --> 00:36:42.186
and sort out my life before dying.

638
00:36:43.587 --> 00:36:45.217
But my mind melted away.

639
00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:47.627
I don't know if it's real or not,

640
00:36:47.627 --> 00:36:50.326
but I didn't hate it when my children smiled at me.

641
00:36:52.697 --> 00:36:53.726
Right.

642
00:36:54.226 --> 00:36:56.766
My daughter-in-law is pregnant.

643
00:36:56.996 --> 00:36:58.137
Really?

644
00:36:58.567 --> 00:37:00.697
You're being a grandfather.

645
00:37:01.137 --> 00:37:02.436
Congratulations.

646
00:37:03.337 --> 00:37:06.536
I'm worried about Ji An and Ji Ho.

647
00:37:08.507 --> 00:37:09.576
(Ji An)

648
00:37:13.377 --> 00:37:14.587
Hello?

649
00:37:14.587 --> 00:37:16.416
Dad, you know what?

650
00:37:16.416 --> 00:37:18.587
I won the third place...

651
00:37:18.587 --> 00:37:20.357
in a design contest.

652
00:37:21.157 --> 00:37:23.887
A design contest? What does that mean?

653
00:37:23.887 --> 00:37:26.427
It's a design contest for household items.

654
00:37:26.427 --> 00:37:28.366
And I won the third place.

655
00:37:29.266 --> 00:37:30.666
You did?

656
00:37:30.996 --> 00:37:32.766
Actually it's all because of you.

657
00:37:32.766 --> 00:37:35.107
I got the idea looking at your room.

658
00:37:35.107 --> 00:37:37.266
That's why I'm calling you first.

659
00:37:37.266 --> 00:37:40.706
How did you do that? You didn't even learn design.

660
00:37:41.476 --> 00:37:43.976
Seok Doo, Ji An won...

661
00:37:43.976 --> 00:37:46.646
the third place in a design contest.

662
00:37:48.116 --> 00:37:49.516
Is Uncle Seok Doo there?

663
00:37:49.516 --> 00:37:52.286
Yes. He came to Korea on business.

664
00:37:52.587 --> 00:37:54.987
Really? Have a good time with him then.

665
00:37:54.987 --> 00:37:57.596
I'll text you the details.

666
00:37:58.697 --> 00:38:01.226
Thank you, Dad. Bye.

667
00:38:03.826 --> 00:38:05.737
Why would she thank me?

668
00:38:06.436 --> 00:38:08.806
I envy you for having a daughter.

669
00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:10.407
Wait a second.

670
00:38:13.677 --> 00:38:15.777
She got the prize of 1,000 dollars.

671
00:38:16.206 --> 00:38:19.116
She can study at Onnea Design School...

672
00:38:19.116 --> 00:38:21.447
in Finland for six months.

673
00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:23.846
Isn't it amazing?

674
00:38:23.846 --> 00:38:27.116
You knew she has a talent for art.

675
00:38:28.927 --> 00:38:31.527
I couldn't support her talent though.

676
00:38:40.237 --> 00:38:42.067
Ji Soo's father...

677
00:38:42.067 --> 00:38:45.377
is a real support for her.

678
00:38:46.976 --> 00:38:48.677
I envy him.

679
00:38:59.587 --> 00:39:01.857
I apologize for causing so much trouble.

680
00:39:02.387 --> 00:39:05.556
You are right. You caused so much trouble.

681
00:39:06.357 --> 00:39:08.726
What were you thinking?

682
00:39:09.697 --> 00:39:10.766
I couldn't...

683
00:39:11.297 --> 00:39:13.896
let Ji Soo go abroad to study because of me.

684
00:39:14.766 --> 00:39:16.206
I just couldn't let her...

685
00:39:16.206 --> 00:39:18.677
live a life she doesn't want.

686
00:39:18.677 --> 00:39:20.877
Are you saying you did it out of responsibility?

687
00:39:20.877 --> 00:39:22.277
That's not all.

688
00:39:24.007 --> 00:39:26.947
I regretted breaking up with Ji Soo.

689
00:39:27.817 --> 00:39:30.817
Ji Soo decided to leave here because of me.

690
00:39:31.657 --> 00:39:33.956
But I only thought about myself.

691
00:39:35.087 --> 00:39:38.226
I didn't even know how much I like her.

692
00:39:41.266 --> 00:39:43.567
How much do you like Ji Soo?

693
00:39:45.396 --> 00:39:47.866
I like her a lot. Very much.

694
00:39:47.866 --> 00:39:49.306
How much?

695
00:39:50.206 --> 00:39:51.837
We've been through...

696
00:39:51.837 --> 00:39:54.377
difficult times together, not like we expected,

697
00:39:54.377 --> 00:39:57.007
but we just started our relationship.

698
00:40:00.717 --> 00:40:04.146
Sure. You're just having a relationship now.

699
00:40:05.357 --> 00:40:08.286
You should date each other to see how it turns out.

700
00:40:15.297 --> 00:40:16.427
He approved us to date.

701
00:40:16.427 --> 00:40:18.096
- He did! - I know.

702
00:40:21.337 --> 00:40:22.936
Wait. Look at me.

703
00:40:24.436 --> 00:40:25.737
There's something on your lips.

704
00:40:25.877 --> 00:40:27.007
Thank you.

705
00:40:34.076 --> 00:40:36.587
Which color would look better on me?

706
00:40:37.857 --> 00:40:39.016
Let me see.

707
00:40:41.387 --> 00:40:43.627
If you tell them they look good in everything,

708
00:40:43.627 --> 00:40:45.996
they would know your intention.

709
00:40:49.826 --> 00:40:51.036
Okay.

710
00:40:51.096 --> 00:40:54.067
I just sold the same one in yellow earlier today.

711
00:40:54.067 --> 00:40:55.467
As you're slim,

712
00:40:55.467 --> 00:40:58.177
you'd look better in a brighter color.

713
00:40:58.177 --> 00:40:59.237
Please wait a second.

714
00:41:01.377 --> 00:41:02.507
How about this?

715
00:41:03.706 --> 00:41:04.947
How much is that?

716
00:41:05.177 --> 00:41:07.746
Cheaper than that. It's 25 dollars.

717
00:41:08.116 --> 00:41:09.186
Is it?

718
00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:14.757
This does suit me better.

719
00:41:16.857 --> 00:41:18.127
I'll get this for my sister.

720
00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:20.027
I'll take these two.

721
00:41:20.896 --> 00:41:22.166
Both of them?

722
00:41:23.096 --> 00:41:24.166
Okay.

723
00:41:29.436 --> 00:41:32.206
That'll be 62 dollars for the 2.

724
00:41:32.377 --> 00:41:35.907
Thank you. You bought 2, so I'll give you 2...

725
00:41:39.817 --> 00:41:41.516
I was going to give her two dollars off.

726
00:41:43.317 --> 00:41:44.456
Business...

727
00:41:44.556 --> 00:41:48.027
isn't about selling goods, it's selling sincerity.

728
00:41:50.387 --> 00:41:52.757
I actually sell more when I'm honest.

729
00:41:55.896 --> 00:41:57.226
Is business thriving?

730
00:42:01.706 --> 00:42:04.107
I came to buy something, and there's nothing left.

731
00:42:05.837 --> 00:42:08.706
You must be really bored to come here.

732
00:42:09.306 --> 00:42:11.547
Oh, weren't you at the club?

733
00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:15.116
The club? What club?

734
00:42:15.746 --> 00:42:18.916
You came, then ran away. Why did you run off?

735
00:42:19.357 --> 00:42:22.956
I didn't run off. I left because it was time.

736
00:42:23.357 --> 00:42:24.857
You'd just come in.

737
00:42:32.396 --> 00:42:33.467
Did you leave...

738
00:42:34.266 --> 00:42:35.637
because you saw me?

739
00:42:36.166 --> 00:42:37.237
Why?

740
00:42:39.976 --> 00:42:42.476
Because we'd agreed not to see each other again.

741
00:42:43.306 --> 00:42:44.877
It's emergency times.

742
00:42:44.877 --> 00:42:46.447
Emergency times.

743
00:42:47.616 --> 00:42:48.786
Then why are you here?

744
00:42:49.686 --> 00:42:50.786
Here?

745
00:42:52.157 --> 00:42:53.357
Here...

746
00:42:54.116 --> 00:42:55.757
This place is...

747
00:42:57.087 --> 00:42:58.826
I'm here to help you.

748
00:43:00.257 --> 00:43:01.496
Do you like me?

749
00:43:05.936 --> 00:43:08.366
Wait, why are you quiet?

750
00:43:08.837 --> 00:43:10.976
Don't even dream about it.

751
00:43:11.476 --> 00:43:13.337
Our families are enemies.

752
00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:16.107
Me and princesses? No thanks.

753
00:43:16.877 --> 00:43:19.377
Hey, I don't like guys like you either.

754
00:43:19.547 --> 00:43:21.286
Me liking you? That's impossible.

755
00:43:21.686 --> 00:43:23.786
I showed up because I was bored.

756
00:43:25.817 --> 00:43:27.686
You seem to be busy. I should go.

757
00:43:38.666 --> 00:43:40.596
I didn't get to thank her.

758
00:43:41.137 --> 00:43:43.137
She helped us get Ji Soo back.

759
00:43:45.907 --> 00:43:48.047
The living expenses...

760
00:43:49.177 --> 00:43:50.677
for six months...

761
00:43:51.146 --> 00:43:52.416
won't be provided.

762
00:44:00.857 --> 00:44:02.157
Dear Father.

763
00:44:02.427 --> 00:44:04.797
I did as you said...

764
00:44:04.797 --> 00:44:07.127
and had a record sales day.

765
00:44:07.527 --> 00:44:09.226
Congratulations.

766
00:44:09.996 --> 00:44:11.036
Good for him.

767
00:44:19.777 --> 00:44:23.177
(Insurance Policy)

768
00:44:30.087 --> 00:44:34.987
(Amount of payout)

769
00:44:41.527 --> 00:44:43.067
(Congratulations!)

770
00:44:43.067 --> 00:44:44.637
(Seo Ji An, you came third.)

771
00:44:47.766 --> 00:44:49.637
(Tuition for three-month language course...)

772
00:44:49.637 --> 00:44:51.507
(and six-month design course provided.)

773
00:45:44.927 --> 00:45:48.766
I'd like to make a claim on my cancer policy.

774
00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:50.666
What papers do I need?

775
00:45:52.467 --> 00:45:55.266
I took out the policy a long time ago.

776
00:45:57.407 --> 00:45:59.436
(Resignation)

777
00:46:01.007 --> 00:46:02.146
What's this?

778
00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:03.846
You're my superior.

779
00:46:04.076 --> 00:46:05.817
With a hotline to the chairman.

780
00:46:05.916 --> 00:46:07.846
You decide what he does.

781
00:46:08.916 --> 00:46:10.487
You give this to him.

782
00:46:10.646 --> 00:46:12.387
Why are you doing this?

783
00:46:12.556 --> 00:46:13.956
I want a break.

784
00:46:16.487 --> 00:46:18.197
You can't just leave.

785
00:46:18.697 --> 00:46:20.896
What'll you do if you quit?

786
00:46:26.467 --> 00:46:27.706
What's going on?

787
00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:30.007
Why is everyone doing this to me?

788
00:46:55.266 --> 00:46:58.096
Hi, Dad. Why are you calling so early?

789
00:46:58.496 --> 00:47:00.637
Let's meet up after work.

790
00:47:02.036 --> 00:47:05.507
Dad, I actually have plans.

791
00:47:05.777 --> 00:47:07.976
- Will tomorrow... - I won't take long.

792
00:47:29.996 --> 00:47:33.837
Why are you staring at me? I feel nervous.

793
00:47:36.036 --> 00:47:37.137
Ji An.

794
00:47:38.907 --> 00:47:40.777
I know that...

795
00:47:42.047 --> 00:47:43.447
I don't have...

796
00:47:43.677 --> 00:47:47.317
the right to tell you how to live your life.

797
00:47:47.746 --> 00:47:50.416
No, why would you say that?

798
00:47:51.487 --> 00:47:52.686
Can I tell you something?

799
00:47:52.887 --> 00:47:54.326
Of course.

800
00:47:55.987 --> 00:47:57.826
Go to Finland.

801
00:47:58.427 --> 00:48:01.366
I'll pay for the expenses.

802
00:48:03.197 --> 00:48:05.337
How can you do that?

803
00:48:05.837 --> 00:48:08.507
I haven't yet decided if I'll go.

804
00:48:08.536 --> 00:48:11.706
Even if I do go, I'll work part-time to save up.

805
00:48:12.377 --> 00:48:14.507
You haven't decided or can't decide?

806
00:48:15.447 --> 00:48:16.447
What?

807
00:48:16.547 --> 00:48:17.916
I saw you two.

808
00:48:18.947 --> 00:48:21.516
You and the Haesung family's grandson.

809
00:48:24.217 --> 00:48:25.487
Dad...

810
00:48:25.786 --> 00:48:27.686
You said you weren't dating.

811
00:48:28.556 --> 00:48:30.157
You said you'd never see him again.

812
00:48:32.857 --> 00:48:34.496
The thing is, Dad...

813
00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:36.127
I believed you.

814
00:48:36.726 --> 00:48:39.996
Before that, I said it was impossible...

815
00:48:40.067 --> 00:48:41.436
when the chairman visited.

816
00:48:42.967 --> 00:48:44.067
Do you know why?

817
00:48:45.177 --> 00:48:46.737
Because I know you.

818
00:48:47.576 --> 00:48:49.607
Because you know...

819
00:48:49.607 --> 00:48:51.416
what we did to them.

820
00:48:51.947 --> 00:48:53.377
I didn't think...

821
00:48:54.146 --> 00:48:56.246
you'd ever accept his affections.

822
00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:58.016
Even if you liked him,

823
00:48:59.456 --> 00:49:01.887
I believed you to be able to control yourself.

824
00:49:04.396 --> 00:49:07.666
We decided to date for only a week.

825
00:49:11.967 --> 00:49:13.297
For a week?

826
00:49:15.266 --> 00:49:18.877
I felt it was so unfair to not even date him.

827
00:49:26.217 --> 00:49:27.416
I think...

828
00:49:30.246 --> 00:49:31.987
Today's the last day.

829
00:49:40.127 --> 00:49:41.326
I'm sorry.

830
00:49:43.797 --> 00:49:45.936
I'm sorry we made you meet him.

831
00:49:49.567 --> 00:49:52.476
I'm sorry I can't let you love in peace.

832
00:49:52.877 --> 00:49:56.507
Dad, stop it. You don't have to say that.

833
00:49:58.246 --> 00:50:00.646
They will never accept you.

834
00:50:06.056 --> 00:50:07.956
I'm not interested either.

835
00:50:09.657 --> 00:50:12.127
Then go to Finland...

836
00:50:12.496 --> 00:50:16.826
and chase the dream you pushed back for so long.

837
00:50:33.246 --> 00:50:35.646
Why is Mr. Choi interpreting part-time?

838
00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:37.887
Wasn't he sent to Europe?

839
00:50:37.987 --> 00:50:39.786
Isn't this Choi Do Kyung?

840
00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:42.257
I work at Hotel MJ's Europe office.

841
00:50:42.257 --> 00:50:44.627
Choi Do Kyung didn't come here on January 1.

842
00:50:45.226 --> 00:50:47.027
Did Choi Do Kyung leave home because of...

843
00:50:47.027 --> 00:50:48.797
women problems? No way.

844
00:50:49.326 --> 00:50:52.996
Did Chairman No bury her and his grandson already?

845
00:50:53.337 --> 00:50:55.237
Doesn't he look a bit dazed?

846
00:50:55.237 --> 00:50:56.907
It must be true that he's working part-time...

847
00:50:56.907 --> 00:50:57.976
for drug money.

848
00:50:57.976 --> 00:50:59.306
(Rumors of a new drug)

849
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:00.407
Drugs?

850
00:51:01.177 --> 00:51:02.346
Woman in mystery?

851
00:51:03.047 --> 00:51:04.377
And he left home?

852
00:51:12.357 --> 00:51:13.786
The rumors...

853
00:51:15.027 --> 00:51:16.726
will have spread already.

854
00:51:17.627 --> 00:51:20.257
Reporters are calling to confirm.

855
00:51:20.697 --> 00:51:21.996
Say they're just rumors!

856
00:51:27.637 --> 00:51:28.637
(Choi Jae Sung)

857
00:51:35.777 --> 00:51:36.846
Hello?

858
00:51:37.146 --> 00:51:38.677
What are you doing?

859
00:51:39.116 --> 00:51:40.646
Report to my office now!

860
00:51:41.087 --> 00:51:43.487
Did Ms. No not pass you my resignation?

861
00:51:43.786 --> 00:51:45.286
I resigned.

862
00:51:46.456 --> 00:51:47.587
What?

863
00:51:48.387 --> 00:51:50.027
I resigned.

864
00:51:50.387 --> 00:51:52.427
Thank you for everything so far, sir.

865
00:51:52.896 --> 00:51:54.596
I have to go.

866
00:51:57.567 --> 00:51:58.996
You resigned?

867
00:52:00.436 --> 00:52:01.837
These fools.

868
00:52:06.576 --> 00:52:08.146
So you can't wait?

869
00:52:10.107 --> 00:52:12.846
Do you want my seat now?

870
00:52:30.896 --> 00:52:33.967
We'll cut the tape and officially announce...

871
00:52:33.967 --> 00:52:35.907
DK Eco Tech's open for business.

872
00:52:41.447 --> 00:52:42.476
Ready?

873
00:52:43.206 --> 00:52:45.877
1, 2, 3.

874
00:52:53.987 --> 00:52:55.927
1, 2, 3.

875
00:52:55.927 --> 00:52:56.956
Let's go!

876
00:52:56.956 --> 00:52:58.096
Perfect.

877
00:52:59.427 --> 00:53:02.726
It's cold. Let's go inside and have some warm food.

878
00:53:02.726 --> 00:53:04.166
- Let's go. - Okay.

879
00:53:04.166 --> 00:53:05.467
It's so cold.

880
00:53:05.467 --> 00:53:06.666
I'll eat a lot.

881
00:53:06.666 --> 00:53:08.567
We need to warm up.

882
00:53:08.766 --> 00:53:10.206
(Haesung Corporation)

883
00:53:13.137 --> 00:53:15.076
President of Haesung Apparel, Choi Do Kyung.

884
00:53:15.146 --> 00:53:17.746
Head of Haesung FNB Europe, Jung Myung Soo.

885
00:53:19.947 --> 00:53:21.516
What's this?

886
00:53:21.516 --> 00:53:24.516
Choi Do Kyung is promoted to president?

887
00:53:28.257 --> 00:53:29.726
(Announcement)

888
00:53:29.726 --> 00:53:31.896
He's sending Jung Myung Soo abroad.

889
00:53:31.896 --> 00:53:33.027
That's harsh.

890
00:53:33.027 --> 00:53:35.326
Jung Myung Soo's a capable executive.

891
00:53:35.326 --> 00:53:37.596
Haesung Apparel was profitable.

892
00:53:37.596 --> 00:53:40.137
He even secured the land to build the new resorts.

893
00:53:40.596 --> 00:53:42.806
He's putting blood first.

894
00:53:42.866 --> 00:53:45.576
Where is Mr. Choi anyway?

895
00:53:45.976 --> 00:53:48.706
Will he show up to accept his new position?

896
00:53:57.317 --> 00:53:59.357
How dare he does it to us?

897
00:53:59.456 --> 00:54:00.987
We did all the work...

898
00:54:00.987 --> 00:54:03.286
and he made that kid a president!

899
00:54:03.286 --> 00:54:06.556
We'll never understand Mr. No's twisted mind.

900
00:54:07.197 --> 00:54:09.326
He praised me at the meeting...

901
00:54:09.967 --> 00:54:11.436
only to demote me.

902
00:54:11.436 --> 00:54:13.036
Why did you come here?

903
00:54:13.036 --> 00:54:14.306
You should have met my dad.

904
00:54:14.306 --> 00:54:15.407
What for?

905
00:54:16.266 --> 00:54:18.536
I guess you're right. There's no point.

906
00:54:19.177 --> 00:54:20.536
It won't help.

907
00:54:23.306 --> 00:54:24.576
(Chairman)

908
00:54:31.887 --> 00:54:32.887
Hello, Dad.

909
00:54:32.887 --> 00:54:34.757
I know your husband is there with you.

910
00:54:35.556 --> 00:54:36.556
Put him on.

911
00:54:38.896 --> 00:54:41.326
He knows you're here.

912
00:54:47.096 --> 00:54:48.206
Hello, sir.

913
00:54:49.166 --> 00:54:51.337
Did you run straight to your wife?

914
00:54:52.036 --> 00:54:54.947
I gave you a chance to prove yourself.

915
00:54:55.047 --> 00:54:56.107
A chance you said?

916
00:54:56.107 --> 00:54:59.277
If you make our resorts in Europe a success,

917
00:54:59.677 --> 00:55:02.516
I'll make you vice chairman.

918
00:55:07.757 --> 00:55:09.127
Do you mean that?

919
00:55:09.127 --> 00:55:11.826
Will you really make me vice chairman?

920
00:55:11.826 --> 00:55:15.467
Of course. This is a ploy to get Do Kyung back.

921
00:55:16.567 --> 00:55:19.266
You're a smart man. You know what I mean.

922
00:55:24.936 --> 00:55:26.837
- It's nice. - They'll do good.

923
00:55:26.976 --> 00:55:28.806
- Eat all you want. - Thanks.

924
00:55:28.846 --> 00:55:30.076
Do help us out.

925
00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:31.076
No worries.

926
00:55:31.076 --> 00:55:33.146
We should start cleaning up.

927
00:55:33.646 --> 00:55:34.916
I'll help.

928
00:55:38.317 --> 00:55:40.157
What'll you do today?

929
00:55:40.387 --> 00:55:41.786
It's your last day.

930
00:55:42.387 --> 00:55:43.556
It's a secret.

931
00:55:47.527 --> 00:55:50.326
Do Kyung's been really serious for a while.

932
00:55:50.996 --> 00:55:52.467
It must be hard on him.

933
00:56:07.947 --> 00:56:09.786
Dad, what happened?

934
00:56:09.786 --> 00:56:13.416
Why is Do Kyung president of Haesung Apparel?

935
00:56:14.116 --> 00:56:16.757
I'm sick of arguing with him,

936
00:56:16.757 --> 00:56:18.496
so I gave him one last chance.

937
00:56:22.967 --> 00:56:24.666
I'm done waiting.

938
00:56:25.896 --> 00:56:28.436
He'll come to you. I'm sure.

939
00:56:28.806 --> 00:56:31.806
If Do Kyung refuses my offer,

940
00:56:33.837 --> 00:56:36.407
your family is over.

941
00:56:37.547 --> 00:56:39.116
I'll abandon you all...

942
00:56:40.547 --> 00:56:42.186
and choose Jin Hee over you.

943
00:56:47.357 --> 00:56:49.157
I'm leaving for Hawaii today.

944
00:56:49.456 --> 00:56:51.797
I can't stand the air here.

945
00:56:51.797 --> 00:56:53.127
It's too contaminated.

946
00:56:57.027 --> 00:56:59.866
Send Do Kyung my regards.

947
00:57:00.637 --> 00:57:02.936
And tell him to do his job.

948
00:57:06.007 --> 00:57:08.907
But my husband...

949
00:57:10.576 --> 00:57:11.746
Let him be.

950
00:57:12.277 --> 00:57:14.246
Let him think he resigned.

951
00:57:17.346 --> 00:57:19.616
For Do Kyung to settle in,

952
00:57:21.157 --> 00:57:23.657
your husband needs to be vice chairman.

953
00:57:25.456 --> 00:57:27.427
And you talk to your sister.

954
00:57:27.427 --> 00:57:29.666
Tell her that this is just...

955
00:57:29.666 --> 00:57:31.896
a ploy to get Do Kyung back.

956
00:57:34.436 --> 00:57:36.766
That way, they'll keep quiet.

957
00:57:38.306 --> 00:57:39.837
I told them that if Do Kyung settles in,

958
00:57:39.837 --> 00:57:41.706
I'll make him vice chairman.

959
00:57:43.107 --> 00:57:44.746
Our family is important too.

960
00:57:46.016 --> 00:57:49.717
As you know, Jae Sung is good at his job.

961
00:58:01.927 --> 00:58:03.226
What shall we do today?

962
00:58:03.627 --> 00:58:05.737
You like extreme sports, don't you?

963
00:58:06.197 --> 00:58:08.907
What I do is too dangerous for you.

964
00:58:09.206 --> 00:58:10.666
What did you do?

965
00:58:10.976 --> 00:58:12.337
Mountain biking, hang-gliding,

966
00:58:12.337 --> 00:58:13.737
water-skiing.

967
00:58:14.076 --> 00:58:16.206
You haven't tried what I do.

968
00:58:17.007 --> 00:58:19.777
You do something I haven't heard of?

969
00:58:20.317 --> 00:58:23.616
I'll show you what real extreme sports is.

970
00:58:23.947 --> 00:58:25.056
Let's go.

971
00:58:26.116 --> 00:58:28.627
I need a medical certificate to make...

972
00:58:28.627 --> 00:58:30.387
a claim on my medical insurance.

973
00:58:30.387 --> 00:58:31.857
Okay.

974
00:58:33.826 --> 00:58:35.726
I don't have cancer?

975
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:38.197
That can't be true.

976
00:58:38.567 --> 00:58:40.396
You were under a lot of stress...

977
00:58:40.396 --> 00:58:43.366
and mistook gastritis symptoms for cancer.

978
00:58:43.666 --> 00:58:46.007
You imagined that you had cancer.

979
00:58:46.476 --> 00:58:49.047
You have to be wrong, doctor.

980
00:58:49.047 --> 00:58:50.346
I know my symptoms.

981
00:58:50.346 --> 00:58:53.016
This isn't gastritis.

982
00:58:53.817 --> 00:58:56.846
Could the test results be wrong?

983
00:58:57.447 --> 00:58:59.217
I told your family that...

984
00:58:59.217 --> 00:59:00.987
you have to get a psychological treatment.

985
00:59:17.036 --> 00:59:19.436
You've never tried this, have you?

986
00:59:20.507 --> 00:59:21.947
Snow sleds?

987
00:59:22.047 --> 00:59:23.777
Isn't this for kids?

988
00:59:23.777 --> 00:59:26.277
You won't say that after you try it.

989
00:59:52.306 --> 00:59:53.877
Do Kyung!

990
00:59:57.547 --> 00:59:58.976
Are you okay?

991
00:59:58.976 --> 01:00:00.677
Well? Isn't it fun?

992
01:00:00.677 --> 01:00:02.447
- Isn't it fun? - It's great fun.

993
01:00:02.447 --> 01:00:05.686
This is the most extreme sport I've ever tried.

994
01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:07.757
I knew you'd say that.

995
01:00:08.357 --> 01:00:10.996
What's that? Is there a two-person sled?

996
01:00:11.157 --> 01:00:13.556
We should've tried that first.

997
01:00:13.556 --> 01:00:14.726
- Do Kyung. - What?

998
01:00:15.996 --> 01:00:17.067
Ouch.

999
01:00:17.226 --> 01:00:19.837
Seo Ji An. How dare you?

1000
01:00:19.837 --> 01:00:21.407
- Please don't! - There you go!

1001
01:00:21.666 --> 01:00:23.536
That's not fair.

1002
01:00:23.766 --> 01:00:25.536
How could you?

1003
01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:19.657
It's so fun.

1004
01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:21.467
- It's so fun. - Let's go ride it again.

1005
01:01:21.467 --> 01:01:22.596
One more round.

1006
01:01:22.697 --> 01:01:24.096
- Again. - Lets' go again.

1007
01:01:28.536 --> 01:01:30.206
They aren't getting tired.

1008
01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.576
Let's go wait in the parking lot near his car.

1009
01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:38.616
You're going to get sick.

1010
01:01:39.547 --> 01:01:42.547
They should eat something before leaving.

1011
01:01:44.757 --> 01:01:45.786
Let's go.

1012
01:01:46.157 --> 01:01:47.757
Let's go. Let's go.

1013
01:02:15.286 --> 01:02:17.286
I can't ride it anymore.

1014
01:02:17.657 --> 01:02:18.717
Me neither.

1015
01:02:22.056 --> 01:02:23.127
Are you okay?

1016
01:02:23.987 --> 01:02:25.257
I'm okay.

1017
01:02:27.797 --> 01:02:29.766
You're so wrecked, Seo Ji An.

1018
01:02:30.427 --> 01:02:32.596
Let me fix you.

1019
01:02:46.616 --> 01:02:47.717
What?

1020
01:03:04.996 --> 01:03:06.266
You were hiding it.

1021
01:03:13.806 --> 01:03:15.507
It's a nice necklace.

1022
01:03:27.516 --> 01:03:31.157
It was fun for a week.

1023
01:03:35.297 --> 01:03:36.297
Me too.

1024
01:03:40.366 --> 01:03:41.436
By the way,

1025
01:03:43.306 --> 01:03:45.206
there's something I couldn't say.

1026
01:03:51.116 --> 01:03:52.116
I love you.

1027
01:04:03.326 --> 01:04:04.496
Me too.

1028
01:05:19.467 --> 01:05:22.706
Mr. No. We're near the airport.

1029
01:05:28.377 --> 01:05:30.677
When you go, you should stay for a month.

1030
01:05:30.877 --> 01:05:32.576
You stayed in Korea for too long.

1031
01:05:41.657 --> 01:05:42.887
(Choi Do Kyung)

1032
01:05:43.987 --> 01:05:46.127
Look. It's Do Kyung.

1033
01:05:47.596 --> 01:05:49.326
He was too scared to call me.

1034
01:05:50.527 --> 01:05:51.637
He texted me instead.

1035
01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:58.137
(I'm already a president of DK Eco Tech.)

1036
01:05:58.737 --> 01:06:00.177
What's this?

1037
01:06:01.507 --> 01:06:04.146
I'm already a president of DK Eco Tech.

1038
01:06:05.016 --> 01:06:07.817
I decline Haesung Apparel president position.

1039
01:06:10.887 --> 01:06:11.987
How dare he...

1040
01:06:20.496 --> 01:06:22.866
How dare you do this to me?

1041
01:06:25.337 --> 01:06:27.036
How dare you reject Haesung?

1042
01:06:33.837 --> 01:06:35.047
Do Kyung...

1043
01:06:35.846 --> 01:06:37.846
How dare you...

1044
01:06:39.217 --> 01:06:40.346
Mr. No.

1045
01:06:41.047 --> 01:06:42.616
Mr. No. Mr. No.

1046
01:06:42.887 --> 01:06:43.916
Mr. No.

1047
01:06:44.217 --> 01:06:45.257
Mr. No.

1048
01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:49.357
Mr. No, look at me. Mr. No.

1049
01:06:49.686 --> 01:06:50.927
Mr. No.

1050
01:06:51.197 --> 01:06:52.627
Mr. No.

1051
01:06:53.197 --> 01:06:54.226
Mr. No.
