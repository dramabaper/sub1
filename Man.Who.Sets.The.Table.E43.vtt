(Episode 43)

2
00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:12.860
Ms, Choi, hurry,

3
00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.330
I'm heavier than you,

4
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.030
Han Gyul, can you please slow down?

5
00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:22.470
Ms, Choi, do your best,

6
00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:23.610
Han Gyul,

7
00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.710
- Han Gyul, - Mom,

8
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:06.010
Mom, you're suffocating me, What's going on?

9
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.750
It's nothing,

10
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.320
What's wrong?

11
00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.720
Do you know her?

12
00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:17.860
No,

13
00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:21.330
Take Han Gyul home,

14
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.430
What will you do?

15
00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.470
Leave it to me, Go home,

16
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.250
What are you doing?

17
00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:42.050
Follow me,

18
00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:54.160
Han Gyul, let's go,

19
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.500
What is happening right now?

20
00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.880
Who is she to upset the doctor and his wife so much?

21
00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:09.580
She can't be,,,

22
00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:13.850
Let go, It hurts,

23
00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:17.090
It hurts? Does it hurt?

24
00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:19.990
Are you sure that you are someone capable of feeling things like that?

25
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.050
What do you mean?

26
00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.090
Do you know what my wife went through because of you?

27
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:26.660
If you have a conscience,

28
00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:28.990
you should feel sorry,,,

29
00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.800
and not try to extort money,

30
00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:33.400
If you were a human,

31
00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:36.270
you wouldn't put your daughter in danger,

32
00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.310
Was it hard for you?

33
00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:43.250
You don't think that I'm the cause, do you?

34
00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:47.180
Half of Han Gyul is from you,

35
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:49.580
You became a dad overnight,

36
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.720
Did you think that you wouldn't have to pay a price?

37
00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:54.260
It's the same for your wife,

38
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.260
She has a healthy child now when she's infertile,

39
00:02:57.527 --> 00:03:00.900
You should've been ready for that kind of price,

40
00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:03.030
Jung Su Mi, are you serious?

41
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.970
I'm warning you,

42
00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:10.370
You're going to be in trouble if you talk about Yeon Ju,,,

43
00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:11.940
with that dirty mouth one more time,

44
00:03:13.577 --> 00:03:15.010
I'm serious,

45
00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.180
Be careful,

46
00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.580
Tell me where my sister is,

47
00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:23.550
I'm here to pick her up,

48
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.900
Mom, who was that lady earlier?

49
00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:41.830
Who?

50
00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:44.770
That lady who went with Dad,

51
00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:47.980
She was surprised after seeing me,

52
00:03:48.612 --> 00:03:50.080
Was she surprised?

53
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.310
Yes, like this,

54
00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:56.520
She,,,

55
00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:00.690
must have been surprised because you're so pretty,

56
00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:03.920
Really? Then why did Dad become upset,,,

57
00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:06.590
and take her away?

58
00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:09.700
No, he's not upset,

59
00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:14.070
Ms, Choi, please take Han Gyul home,

60
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.240
Okay,

61
00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:19.770
Is she Han Gyul's birth mother?

62
00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:22.010
Stop talking nonsense,

63
00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:24.010
Just go home,

64
00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:25.080
Okay,

65
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:30.450
Have dinner and play at home,

66
00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:32.750
Your dad and I will go home soon,

67
00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:36.990
Okay, Ms, Choi, let's go,

68
00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:01.520
Is this your doing?

69
00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:04.820
What? My doing?

70
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.760
Do you think that you're kings because you have some money?

71
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.760
She's childish, and she just played a joke,

72
00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:12.630
How could you treat her like this?

73
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.130
Look at her talk,

74
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:17.630
She just played a joke?

75
00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:20.570
Your sister,,,

76
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.400
There's no need to say more,

77
00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.870
I figured out what happened on my way here,

78
00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:26.170
Talk to me,

79
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.210
Jung Su Ji, get up,

80
00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:30.380
Su Mi,

81
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.080
Get up, you idiot,

82
00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:37.690
Wait outside,

83
00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.450
No,

84
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.890
I'm telling you one more time,

85
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:44.990
I did this all by myself, Don't do anything to my sister,

86
00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:47.130
My sister didn't do anything wrong,

87
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.490
She's released now,

88
00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:51.000
I said go out,

89
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.830
Go outside right now,

90
00:05:53.203 --> 00:05:57.000
Are you kidding me?

91
00:05:57.006 --> 00:06:00.810
Your sisterly love is heartrending,

92
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.710
Did you plan this?

93
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.440
Did you plan to scam people,,,

94
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.680
and then blame yourselves when people find out?

95
00:06:06.683 --> 00:06:10.450
Mother, let's send her sister away since she's here,

96
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:13.120
No, I won't allow that,

97
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.990
We have to talk about,,,

98
00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:18.690
who planned to do this,

99
00:06:18.695 --> 00:06:22.130
We have to completely nip the bud,

100
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:26.130
Answer me honestly,

101
00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:30.070
Did you make your sister blackmail my daughter,,,

102
00:06:30.073 --> 00:06:33.240
to extort money from her?

103
00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.310
Did you?

104
00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:43.380
Did you make your sister blackmail my daughter that she will tell,,,

105
00:06:43.386 --> 00:06:46.820
people that Han Gyul isn't her real daughter,,,

106
00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.130
and embarrass her in front of the whole neighborhood?

107
00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:01.700
Yes, I did it,

108
00:07:02.138 --> 00:07:03.870
What's wrong with that?

109
00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:07.940
You scum,

110
00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:09.310
Mother,

111
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.380
What are you doing? You're so ignorant,

112
00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:14.520
Su Mi, are you okay?

113
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.420
Do you know what being a mother is like?

114
00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:26.690
A mother starves,,,

115
00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:29.260
to fully feed her children,

116
00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:32.630
That's what a mother is like,

117
00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:36.230
How could you sell your daughter for money,,,

118
00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:39.640
when you're healthy and alive? You're scum,

119
00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:42.840
Yes, you're right,

120
00:07:43.146 --> 00:07:47.450
I never raised her properly after giving birth to her,

121
00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:51.880
Since the moment I had her, she was nothing but a burden,,,

122
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:55.760
that ruined my life, That's it,

123
00:07:56.493 --> 00:07:58.990
I didn't feel guilty at all when I abandoned her,

124
00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:02.400
Jung Su Mi,

125
00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:07.440
So don't expect me to be a mother or maternal instincts from me,

126
00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:09.200
Money?

127
00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:11.570
You already know,

128
00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:15.580
If you're out from rotting in jail, they won't treat you like a human,

129
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:20.320
Like you said, that's why I sold my child to feed me,

130
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:24.880
Also, you took my daughter for free, and you're living happily,

131
00:08:24.888 --> 00:08:26.550
Can't you pay me that much?

132
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.760
You would pay me several times more if I was a surrogate,

133
00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:31.460
Goodness,

134
00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:34.060
Listen to her speak,

135
00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:37.870
How could you give birth to a child like Han Gyul?

136
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:41.930
I feel so bad for Han Gyul,

137
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.640
The poor child,

138
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.740
Yes, but let's be honest,

139
00:08:48.478 --> 00:08:51.750
Isn't it better for you if I'm like this?

140
00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:54.810
Seeing that you're hiding the truth about Han Gyul's birth,

141
00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:58.420
you're going to raise her like your own,

142
00:08:59.088 --> 00:09:02.320
What will you do,,,

143
00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:03.820
if an incapable ex-convict birth mother appears,,,

144
00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:06.530
and whine that she wants to see Han Gyul?

145
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:10.670
You should be thankful that I'm like this,

146
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.000
Jung Su Mi,

147
00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:15.870
How did you become worse than an animal?

148
00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:18.840
Are you the Jung Su Mi that I used to know?

149
00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:22.240
How could you?

150
00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:26.550
I'm shameful and shuddering,,,

151
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.620
from the fact that I used to spend time with you,

152
00:09:31.788 --> 00:09:32.890
Really?

153
00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:37.390
That's good, You gained your senses, even if it's too late,

154
00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:39.360
But,,,

155
00:09:39.796 --> 00:09:42.500
You and I weren't meant for each other from the beginning,

156
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.670
I was a mess back then,

157
00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:50.370
but now that I have gone though every possible ordeal,

158
00:09:51.207 --> 00:09:53.240
all that's left in me is spite and greed for money,

159
00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:57.250
Han Gyul's biological mother does not exist in this world,

160
00:09:57.447 --> 00:10:00.880
I didn't have maternal love for her even back then,

161
00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:03.750
And it will stay that way for the rest of my life,

162
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:06.020
Just pretend,,,

163
00:10:06.923 --> 00:10:08.620
that Han Gyul has only one biological parent,

164
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.030
Then promise me one thing,

165
00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:15.130
Just like you said, Han Gyul will not be connected to you in any way,

166
00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:19.300
If she has even the slightest memory of you,

167
00:10:19.469 --> 00:10:21.270
I will get rid of it, Completely,

168
00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:26.670
So swear to me that you will never show your face,,,

169
00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:28.910
around us,

170
00:10:33.916 --> 00:10:35.150
Promise me!

171
00:10:40.356 --> 00:10:41.890
I should ask you to promise me,

172
00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:47.500
I'm going to start afresh as a single woman,

173
00:10:48.698 --> 00:10:51.630
Don't visit me with an excuse me that it's hard,,,

174
00:10:51.968 --> 00:10:53.130
to raise her or whatnot,

175
00:10:54.203 --> 00:10:55.970
If you can promise that,

176
00:10:56.706 --> 00:11:00.140
I will never find you first,

177
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.340
Never,

178
00:11:05.615 --> 00:11:07.650
I'll take that as your promise and leave,

179
00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.780
Let's end,,,

180
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.720
our pathetic relationship today,,,

181
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.620
with this promise,

182
00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:19.590
Let's go,

183
00:11:20.063 --> 00:11:21.260
Just a moment,

184
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:22.900
Wait a second,

185
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.050
Pick this up, and leave,

186
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.890
Some money will stop you from doing a monstrous act like this again,

187
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:46.150
Pick this up, and leave,

188
00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:54.500
Su Mi, let's go,

189
00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:12.910
Su Mi,

190
00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:16.780
Don't you forget,

191
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.990
You just abandoned your daughter for this money,

192
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.320
If you ever come back and claim she's your daughter,

193
00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:28.500
that day will the last day for the both of us,

194
00:12:30.299 --> 00:12:31.400
Of course,

195
00:12:32.902 --> 00:12:35.170
I feel I did the right thing to give birth to her for the first time,

196
00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:38.670
Now, I gave away my daughter to you,

197
00:12:39.408 --> 00:12:40.740
Raise her well,

198
00:12:41.444 --> 00:12:43.680
You're one heartless woman,

199
00:13:04.734 --> 00:13:07.670
Isn't this beautiful? It's great for in-between seasons,

200
00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:10.700
Since you have a slim waist,

201
00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:12.870
it will look even slimmer,

202
00:13:13.442 --> 00:13:15.840
- Shall I try this on? - Go ahead,

203
00:13:16.312 --> 00:13:18.180
I think a medium would fit you nicely,

204
00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:19.910
- The fitting room is that way, - Okay,

205
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:26.720
What's taking them so long?

206
00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:30.590
Mom,

207
00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:33.530
My gosh, my daughter is a businesswoman now,

208
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.560
Goodness, well done,

209
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.270
What are you talking about?

210
00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:41.200
With new products for spring, the customers are flooding in,

211
00:13:41.204 --> 00:13:43.200
but I can't think straight because I'm so anxious,

212
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.170
How did it go?

213
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:46.910
Are they still talking?

214
00:13:47.176 --> 00:13:49.480
No, It's over now,

215
00:13:49.812 --> 00:13:51.980
Everything is over now,

216
00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:55.480
All you need to do is raise Han Gyul as your own daughter,

217
00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:57.450
How did it end?

218
00:13:57.453 --> 00:14:00.950
Dr, Lee and I took care of it,

219
00:14:00.957 --> 00:14:03.760
You don't need to worry about it anymore,

220
00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:06.160
Did she give up Han Gyul that easily?

221
00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:09.500
Yes, she did, That's why I feel even worse for Han Gyul,

222
00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:12.500
She's so unfortunate,

223
00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:15.870
So we must love her even more from now on, okay?

224
00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:19.510
I can't believe it, But she gave birth to Han Gyul though,

225
00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:21.170
Mom, let me go upstairs,

226
00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:22.670
No, don't,

227
00:14:22.678 --> 00:14:24.710
Why would you want to meet that nasty woman?

228
00:14:24.714 --> 00:14:25.980
It will only take a minute,

229
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:29.380
Hey, no, Come on, Yeon Ju,

230
00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:42.400
Are you all right, Su Mi?

231
00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:43.970
Do you think you can walk?

232
00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:51.910
- Su Mi, - You,,,

233
00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:54.980
If you ever do something as stupid as this again,

234
00:14:56.078 --> 00:14:59.910
I'm going to disappear and kill myself,

235
00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:03.280
What was so bad about what I did?

236
00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:05.990
I did everything for you,

237
00:15:06.689 --> 00:15:08.360
Was that such a bad thing?

238
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:12.260
Besides, it was my doing, Why did you take the blame for me?

239
00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:17.130
If you didn't like what I did, why did you take the money? Why?

240
00:15:18.234 --> 00:15:19.530
Lower your voice,

241
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:21.770
That's how this can end,

242
00:15:22.772 --> 00:15:24.240
I did it to put an end to this,

243
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.540
So you must never come back here,

244
00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:32.050
Did you get that? Did you?

245
00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:45.760
Are you here to check it yourself after hearing it from your mother?

246
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:48.400
I heard everything was over,

247
00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:50.500
It is over, right?

248
00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:54.040
She grew a lot,

249
00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:56.340
My Han Gyul,

250
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.700
"My Han Gyul"?

251
00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.470
Don't be sensitive,

252
00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:05.010
I will never call her mine ever again,

253
00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:09.620
I sold my daughter in exchange for your mother's money,

254
00:16:10.686 --> 00:16:13.520
Starting now, Han Gyul is no longer my daughter,

255
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.420
You can have her,

256
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:17.760
Raise her like she's your daughter,

257
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.390
Don't worry,

258
00:16:19.795 --> 00:16:22.900
I don't need you to tell me that, She's already my daughter,

259
00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:27.270
Well, should I give you a piece of advice since your mother paid me?

260
00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:32.870
When you came to visit me in prison,

261
00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:34.910
do you remember what I told you?

262
00:16:38.314 --> 00:16:39.910
I guess money is a fine thing,

263
00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:43.180
You're not his type, but you managed to get him to marry you,

264
00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:47.490
I was mistaken,

265
00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:52.990
So Won loves you for yourself, not your money,

266
00:16:54.697 --> 00:16:56.260
He had always been cool-headed,

267
00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.370
He told me that you'd been through a lot because of Han Gyul,

268
00:17:00.202 --> 00:17:03.500
He threatened me that if I bother you again,

269
00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.110
he won't let it slide again,

270
00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:07.680
Do you get it now?

271
00:17:08.344 --> 00:17:09.680
He had been genuine with you,

272
00:17:09.812 --> 00:17:11.680
I don't need your presumptuous advice,

273
00:17:11.914 --> 00:17:13.450
Let me give you a warning,

274
00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:17.220
If you ever show your face around us and bother So Won again,

275
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.620
I will not let you off this easily then,

276
00:17:21.057 --> 00:17:22.360
Did you get that?

277
00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:23.590
Sure,

278
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.600
You two are madly in love, Good luck to both of you,

279
00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:30.130
Wait, no,

280
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:32.570
Including Han Gyul, it'd be three of you,

281
00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.800
I will wish you the best,,,

282
00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:39.310
from very far away,,,

283
00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:42.640
with all my heart,

284
00:18:01.597 --> 00:18:02.730
Korean beef set,

285
00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:07.170
I'll keep this in the refrigerator, Grill, and eat it later,

286
00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:10.070
My gosh, Young Hye, you must've spend a fortune,

287
00:18:10.072 --> 00:18:12.900
You bought a whole set of Korean beef just for me,

288
00:18:12.908 --> 00:18:15.070
I don't have that kind of money,

289
00:18:15.077 --> 00:18:17.140
I got it from work for the Lunar New Year holidays,

290
00:18:18.314 --> 00:18:20.980
Why would he give his employees Korean beef sets?

291
00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:23.310
I guess the business is booming,

292
00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:26.150
He gave this only to me,,,

293
00:18:26.222 --> 00:18:27.720
for increasing the sales,

294
00:18:29.258 --> 00:18:30.520
What?

295
00:18:38.067 --> 00:18:39.130
My goodness,

296
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.800
What has gotten into you all of a sudden?

297
00:18:42.004 --> 00:18:43.200
I won't eat this,

298
00:18:47.576 --> 00:18:48.710
What do you think?

299
00:18:49.345 --> 00:18:51.410
She's your future daughter-in-law, Do you like her?

300
00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:53.410
She's nice,

301
00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:56.420
Her eyes are big and clear, She looks like an honest person,

302
00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.290
She has a nice physique too,

303
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.880
She's tall and slim,

304
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.660
Especially, her legs are amazing,

305
00:19:03.659 --> 00:19:06.590
My gosh, men, When did you see that?

306
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.530
She's coming for a visit to say hello to you,

307
00:19:12.868 --> 00:19:14.340
Life must be hard for her,

308
00:19:14.637 --> 00:19:16.140
She has two fathers-in-law to take care of,

309
00:19:16.438 --> 00:19:17.640
I feel the same way,

310
00:19:17.873 --> 00:19:20.200
I think Tae Yang is marrying into a very nice family,

311
00:19:20.209 --> 00:19:23.940
After clearing up misunderstandings, I learned her parents are great too,

312
00:19:24.213 --> 00:19:27.350
They are the married couple I always dreamed of,

313
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.750
That's right, They are the couple,,,

314
00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:32.820
who would never fight,

315
00:19:33.022 --> 00:19:36.250
always stay faithful to one another, and live together,,,

316
00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:37.690
until their hair turns gray,

317
00:19:38.327 --> 00:19:39.630
He's right,

318
00:19:39.662 --> 00:19:41.260
You two should learn,,,

319
00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.700
from her parents,

320
00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:46.470
- Yes, ma'am, - Yes, ma'am,

321
00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:52.540
What is this all about?

322
00:19:52.808 --> 00:19:55.140
Have you lost your mind? What's wrong with you?

323
00:19:55.144 --> 00:19:57.310
So it's from that guy,

324
00:19:58.113 --> 00:20:02.320
I can't accept a single thing from that guy,

325
00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:06.620
I didn't know that you're like this when I lived with you,

326
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:10.350
You're good at accepting anything that is free,

327
00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:13.790
When your boss gives you something expensive,

328
00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.900
you shouldn't just accept it right away,

329
00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:21.470
You should have refused it flatly,

330
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.170
Refuse it like that anti-bribery and graft act!

331
00:20:25.174 --> 00:20:28.980
You should have said that this is too expensive to accept,

332
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:32.210
What does that have to do with me? I'm not a government employee,

333
00:20:32.214 --> 00:20:35.650
When a man spends money on you,

334
00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.580
there must be a reason behind,

335
00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:39.890
Are you just going to accept it when you know that?

336
00:20:40.422 --> 00:20:43.390
Okay, Stop it, I'll take it back,

337
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.030
You should have not brought it,

338
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.800
You're out of mind,

339
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.670
It's tiring for both of us, Let's get to the point now,

340
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.140
I was thinking,,,

341
00:20:59.775 --> 00:21:01.680
that it will look bad on Ru Ri if they find out that,,,

342
00:21:02.544 --> 00:21:07.110
we're done with our marriage, Let's keep it as a secret,

343
00:21:07.883 --> 00:21:08.950
And,,,

344
00:21:09.752 --> 00:21:13.490
I'll invite her in-laws over this weekend,

345
00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:16.420
What? Why would you invite them so soon?

346
00:21:16.558 --> 00:21:18.820
There's nothing good about in-laws hanging out together often,

347
00:21:18.827 --> 00:21:20.120
Set it as next week,

348
00:21:20.129 --> 00:21:22.130
I won't be in Seoul next week,

349
00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:23.800
I have to go to on a business trip,

350
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.860
A business trip? To where?

351
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.240
Ulaanbaatar,

352
00:21:28.804 --> 00:21:31.400
I have to attend a business fair,

353
00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:32.870
What?

354
00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:37.410
How could you attend the fair when you don't even speak Mongolian?

355
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.150
Why would you go there?

356
00:21:41.784 --> 00:21:45.590
I'm telling you this now because I don't want you to get me wrong,

357
00:21:46.188 --> 00:21:48.050
Don't get upset, and listen,

358
00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:50.120
Okay, Tell me,

359
00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:51.990
You aren't going to get mad, right? Promise me,

360
00:21:51.994 --> 00:21:55.700
I won't get mad, Tell me,

361
00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:58.700
I'm going there with my boss,

362
00:21:59.468 --> 00:22:00.630
What?

363
00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:05.800
Hong Young Hye!

364
00:22:05.808 --> 00:22:09.140
You're doing it again, I'm going to leave!

365
00:22:09.812 --> 00:22:11.580
Okay, Okay,

366
00:22:13.882 --> 00:22:15.120
For how many days?

367
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.410
I'm going there for three nights,

368
00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:17.890
Three nights?

369
00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:21.520
This means you're sleeping over?

370
00:22:21.523 --> 00:22:23.820
Stop imagining silly things,

371
00:22:23.826 --> 00:22:25.960
If there's a branch,

372
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:28.390
I'll be out doing training,

373
00:22:28.397 --> 00:22:31.530
So that is why we have to go there to research and everything,

374
00:22:37.906 --> 00:22:39.710
What are you doing?

375
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.840
Can't you see?

376
00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:46.580
I'm writing patience in my heart,

377
00:22:49.918 --> 00:22:51.050
Do you see,,,

378
00:22:52.154 --> 00:22:54.320
how Ru Ri's changed?

379
00:22:54.757 --> 00:22:56.720
I've changed too,

380
00:22:58.327 --> 00:23:02.490
I thought I was only good at cooking and laundry, as you said,

381
00:23:02.498 --> 00:23:04.900
But now people tell me that I'm good at work,

382
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.300
It's really exciting and makes me want to work more,

383
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:10.200
So,,,

384
00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:12.640
don't get in my way, We graduated from marriage,

385
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.270
Be nice and support me,

386
00:23:14.276 --> 00:23:19.580
I want to burn my last spark,

387
00:23:20.082 --> 00:23:21.220
"Last spark"?

388
00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:24.850
Your last spark? Okay, I got it,

389
00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.190
I'll think about whether I'll allow it or not,

390
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.550
You don't have to think about it,

391
00:23:29.558 --> 00:23:32.160
I'm going whether you'll allow it or not,

392
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:35.260
I'll call you when we fix,,,

393
00:23:35.264 --> 00:23:38.900
the time to invite Manager Jung's parents,

394
00:23:44.139 --> 00:23:45.240
Hey,

395
00:23:45.874 --> 00:23:47.070
Hong Young Hye,

396
00:23:49.144 --> 00:23:52.910
Ulaanbaatar? Darn it,

397
00:23:53.582 --> 00:23:55.850
Ulaanbaatar, Ulaanbaatar?

398
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:59.890
You're trying to kill me,

399
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:03.990
Ulaanbaatar, Ulaanbaatar, Ulaanbaatar!

400
00:24:03.992 --> 00:24:08.460
Ulaanbaatar!

401
00:24:15.571 --> 00:24:17.500
He's changed,

402
00:24:17.506 --> 00:24:21.070
He would have gone mad if I told him this when we were together,

403
00:24:21.076 --> 00:24:23.310
He's writing patience in his heart,

404
00:24:26.748 --> 00:24:29.380
You know how beautiful Gobi Desert's night sky is, right?

405
00:24:30.586 --> 00:24:32.920
I don't want to see the Milky Way there alone,

406
00:24:32.921 --> 00:24:34.350
Please go with me,

407
00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:40.890
Don't worry, I'm sick of men,

408
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.800
I won't fall for some stars,

409
00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:58.150
She's someone who died three years ago,

410
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.580
You must have been mistaken,

411
00:25:01.783 --> 00:25:04.820
No, it was Susanna for sure,

412
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.150
I'm quite sure,

413
00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:09.920
There can't be a person who can look exactly like her,

414
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:14.130
Then, what has actually happened?

415
00:25:15.063 --> 00:25:17.400
I even went to her grave,

416
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.450
Sir, it's time to go home,

417
00:25:33.482 --> 00:25:36.120
You should go home first, I've got things to think about,

418
00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:39.120
Is it because of Susanna?

419
00:25:40.055 --> 00:25:42.150
- You're mistaken, - I told you to leave first,

420
00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:43.720
I want to be alone,

421
00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:47.890
I'll go first to prepare for the board meeting,

422
00:26:13.589 --> 00:26:15.090
Her name is Lee Kyung Hwa,

423
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.660
She's the team manager of Goldman Partner's Investment Team One,

424
00:26:18.894 --> 00:26:20.690
I really can't understand this,

425
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.390
How is she related to my father?

426
00:26:23.398 --> 00:26:26.060
Why would the director and Joo Ae Ri try to hurt my father together?

427
00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:29.540
If your father dies, the company will go on a crisis for sure,

428
00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:34.070
Is it because she wants to be the chairman?

429
00:26:34.076 --> 00:26:35.340
It's impossible,

430
00:26:35.978 --> 00:26:38.310
Her share can't be that big,

431
00:26:38.647 --> 00:26:40.280
So what can be the reason?

432
00:26:46.922 --> 00:26:48.090
Yes, Father,

433
00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:51.020
You mean now?

434
00:26:59.568 --> 00:27:00.970
Are we there yet?

435
00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:02.800
We're almost there,

436
00:27:04.473 --> 00:27:08.640
I'm worried if it's right to reveal this tonight,

437
00:27:08.644 --> 00:27:10.780
They're going to find out about it tomorrow anyway,

438
00:27:11.413 --> 00:27:13.650
It's better for you to meet Ae Ri in person than,,,

439
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:16.180
to run into her in the company,

440
00:27:16.618 --> 00:27:19.720
I'm worried that she's going to get mad and not see,,,

441
00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:21.460
the big picture about this,

442
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:24.090
She's still young, We have to give her some time,

443
00:27:25.027 --> 00:27:28.590
Manager Jung and Ru Ri had a family get-together today,

444
00:27:28.597 --> 00:27:30.160
So it's hard for her now,

445
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:36.200
It's been three years,

446
00:27:37.372 --> 00:27:39.670
It's heartbreaking, surprisingly,

447
00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:43.810
So this is why we can't just ignore blood relations,

448
00:27:50.018 --> 00:27:52.320
Has anything happened, sir?

449
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.860
I'm sorry to interrupt your date tonight,

450
00:27:55.991 --> 00:27:59.790
Work is more important to us than anything,

451
00:28:00.629 --> 00:28:04.090
You're right, This year's the most important year for SC,

452
00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:05.670
Let's hang in there,

453
00:28:07.169 --> 00:28:09.400
You wanted to ask something,

454
00:28:09.638 --> 00:28:10.740
Right,

455
00:28:11.573 --> 00:28:15.040
That lady you saw with a burn scar,,,

456
00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:19.380
I think I saw her today,

457
00:28:19.648 --> 00:28:21.880
You've seen her too? Where did you see her?

458
00:28:22.484 --> 00:28:25.790
I saw her at the parking lot of the restaurant we met with her parents,

459
00:28:26.888 --> 00:28:28.460
Are you sure it was her?

460
00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:29.920
I'm absolutely sure,

461
00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:34.830
She has a burn scar on her face like this,

462
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.960
Am I right?

463
00:28:36.198 --> 00:28:37.460
Yes, she does,

464
00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:39.570
Why would she go there?

465
00:28:40.235 --> 00:28:42.230
Do you think she knew about it or went there coincidentally?

466
00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:44.600
I think she came because she knew I would be there,

467
00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:47.640
She ran away right after I met her eyes,

468
00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:49.940
She ran away after seeing you?

469
00:28:51.012 --> 00:28:52.450
By any chance,,,

470
00:28:53.248 --> 00:28:54.820
do you think she's someone who you know?

471
00:28:57.285 --> 00:28:59.450
Who is she?

472
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:14.630
Is this person the woman that you saw?

473
00:29:19.407 --> 00:29:20.570
Yes,

474
00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:23.770
She's older than when this photo was taken,

475
00:29:23.779 --> 00:29:25.650
but I'm sure it's her,

476
00:29:26.715 --> 00:29:28.220
Who is she?

477
00:29:31.319 --> 00:29:34.020
She must be someone close to you,,,

478
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:36.420
to take picture like this,

479
00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:38.120
Who is she?

480
00:29:38.593 --> 00:29:40.230
Well,,,

481
00:29:44.099 --> 00:29:46.130
She died three years ago,

482
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.200
What?

483
00:30:03.552 --> 00:30:04.850
What are you doing?

484
00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:06.190
Can't you see?

485
00:30:07.088 --> 00:30:09.820
As I warned you, I'm going back to the States this weekend,

486
00:30:10.592 --> 00:30:12.890
You have to know when to fall back so that you get less miserable,

487
00:30:13.328 --> 00:30:15.230
I'll give all my shares to my dad,

488
00:30:15.831 --> 00:30:18.400
I won't suffer anymore and live at ease from now on,

489
00:30:21.603 --> 00:30:22.840
Are you insane?

490
00:30:23.939 --> 00:30:26.210
After what we've gone through to reach this far,

491
00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:29.210
you'll stop when we're almost there?

492
00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:31.380
Where is the end to this?

493
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.680
No one is even interested in me anymore,

494
00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:37.680
I put up a show to kill myself,

495
00:30:38.486 --> 00:30:42.120
My dad seems to be disgusted by me, but he doesn't visit me in my ward,

496
00:30:43.892 --> 00:30:45.330
And what did you do?

497
00:30:46.027 --> 00:30:49.160
You put me in the hospital and didn't show up at all,

498
00:30:50.065 --> 00:30:52.560
That's because I have work to do,

499
00:30:52.567 --> 00:30:53.730
Work?

500
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.480
Helping Lee Ru Ri and Jung Tae Yang be a happy couple?

501
00:31:06.348 --> 00:31:07.910
Tae Yang is soon to be the influence,

502
00:31:08.516 --> 00:31:11.180
so you decided to take his side like a rat, Aren't I right?

503
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.650
I'm no longer useful,

504
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.160
so I'll get lost before I become more miserable,

505
00:31:19.995 --> 00:31:21.130
Did you forget,,,

506
00:31:21.663 --> 00:31:23.400
what I said in the hospital?

507
00:31:26.368 --> 00:31:28.540
It's not our company,

508
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.700
but the chairman who'll be doomed,

509
00:31:31.373 --> 00:31:33.970
So hang in there until then,

510
00:31:34.042 --> 00:31:37.740
Then you'll get money and find back what you have lost three years ago,

511
00:31:40.348 --> 00:31:41.480
So?

512
00:31:42.217 --> 00:31:43.650
What have I lost three years ago?

513
00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:47.080
You said you'd help me find back what I lost three years ago,

514
00:31:47.088 --> 00:31:48.860
What on earth is that?

515
00:32:22.324 --> 00:32:23.720
Mom?

516
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.360
Long time no see, It's been three years, right?

517
00:32:36.805 --> 00:32:38.840
Joo Ae Ri's mother?

518
00:32:39.507 --> 00:32:42.610
I heard she died in a fire three years ago,

519
00:32:42.811 --> 00:32:44.340
I thought so too,

520
00:32:44.546 --> 00:32:46.780
But apparently, she's alive,

521
00:32:47.315 --> 00:32:50.420
Weren't you there when she passed away?

522
00:32:51.586 --> 00:32:54.450
At that time, I was preparing to settle down back in Korea,

523
00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:58.120
so I packed all my stuff in the States and was staying in Korea,

524
00:32:58.827 --> 00:33:01.130
It was the early year of SC, so I was busy like crazy,

525
00:33:01.763 --> 00:33:04.360
I got a call from the chief director one day,,,

526
00:33:04.866 --> 00:33:06.530
that Ae Ri's mom was in critical condition,

527
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:08.260
And?

528
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:11.130
When I went to see her, it was too late,

529
00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:12.640
I couldn't be there when she died,

530
00:33:13.141 --> 00:33:16.880
The chief director did everything for her funeral,

531
00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:22.920
Does it mean that Ae Ri's mom and the chief director held hands,,,

532
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:24.680
to fool me?

533
00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.490
What could they gain from that?

534
00:33:29.557 --> 00:33:31.020
I'm not sure,

535
00:33:32.994 --> 00:33:37.660
I fully compensated her as I closed my business in the States,

536
00:33:38.133 --> 00:33:39.970
So her death wouldn't have changed anything,

537
00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:43.700
By any chance, do you know Manager Lee Kyung Hwa,,,

538
00:33:44.506 --> 00:33:45.970
of Goldman Partners?

539
00:33:46.708 --> 00:33:48.110
I've never heard of that name,

540
00:33:48.543 --> 00:33:50.140
Did they appoint another person to be in charge?

541
00:33:50.678 --> 00:33:51.850
I think,,,

542
00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:54.580
she's Ae Ri's mother,

543
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.120
What?

544
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.630
We think that the woman with the chief director in the picture,,,

545
00:34:08.963 --> 00:34:10.160
is Ae Ri's mother,

546
00:34:11.232 --> 00:34:12.830
Why did she cover her face with bandages?

547
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:16.700
She went through three burn scar removal surgeries,,,

548
00:34:16.838 --> 00:34:18.240
for three years,

549
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.410
Maybe she got a severe burn from the accident,,,

550
00:34:23.845 --> 00:34:25.640
that she got treated in secret,

551
00:34:25.647 --> 00:34:27.210
If it was out of such a simple intention,

552
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:29.880
how would you explain the Goldman Partners and her relationship?

553
00:34:34.923 --> 00:34:37.020
You might be wrong,

554
00:34:37.258 --> 00:34:40.660
Let's check if she's Ae Ri's mom first,

555
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:42.460
I'll find it out myself tomorrow,

556
00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:47.200
How could you do this?

557
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:49.900
How,,,

558
00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:52.740
How could you fool even your daughter,,,

559
00:34:52.907 --> 00:34:54.840
when you're alive like this?

560
00:34:55.543 --> 00:34:57.280
Stop whining,

561
00:34:57.879 --> 00:35:00.280
If I hadn't done that, you wouldn't have come this far,

562
00:35:00.882 --> 00:35:03.050
You're too stupid to do anything properly,

563
00:35:03.818 --> 00:35:06.020
If you had gained Kevin's favor,

564
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.090
I wouldn't have had to do this much,

565
00:35:08.523 --> 00:35:10.760
You caused all kinds of trouble as you grew up,,,

566
00:35:11.292 --> 00:35:13.290
and fell out of his favor,

567
00:35:14.629 --> 00:35:15.800
What did you say?

568
00:35:17.132 --> 00:35:21.570
So you became a dead person, but what did I gain from that?

569
00:35:23.338 --> 00:35:25.410
Do you realize how much I have suffered?

570
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:29.040
I didn't know about your accident because I played with my friends,

571
00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:31.780
I had nightmares every night,

572
00:35:33.448 --> 00:35:36.050
I was complete heartbroken and sorry,

573
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.090
How could you be so sound and alive?

574
00:35:39.587 --> 00:35:43.160
Do you think you got the shares of SC Food and Beverage for free?

575
00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:47.790
Kevin had a change in his mind because you suffered so much,

576
00:35:47.862 --> 00:35:49.130
So what?

577
00:35:49.464 --> 00:35:51.630
I have the same amount of shares which you had,

578
00:35:51.633 --> 00:35:52.830
It's not the same,

579
00:35:53.501 --> 00:35:55.800
It will be an important tool for my plan in the future,

580
00:35:56.504 --> 00:35:58.340
Starting from tomorrow,

581
00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:01.410
everything will change step by step, so watch it with your own eyes,

582
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.550
Mom, what are you going to do?

583
00:36:08.883 --> 00:36:10.080
You,,,

584
00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:14.820
devoted everything including your heart to Tae Yang, right?

585
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.550
Still, he fell for another girl,

586
00:36:17.559 --> 00:36:20.360
He ignored your heart and trampled on it,

587
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:23.460
It's just like what Kevin did to me,

588
00:36:26.901 --> 00:36:30.600
It wasn't his biological son, Jung Tae Yang,

589
00:36:30.672 --> 00:36:32.700
who helped Kevin's company become this big,

590
00:36:32.707 --> 00:36:34.340
It was you and me,

591
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:37.040
Of course, Chief Director Park was a part of it too,

592
00:36:39.147 --> 00:36:43.150
But they aren't grateful at all, so they better fall to the bottom,

593
00:36:44.152 --> 00:36:47.090
From now on, I'll make it happen,

594
00:36:48.423 --> 00:36:50.360
You just have to wait without worrying a bit,

595
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.030
Everything will be over within a month from now,

596
00:37:18.519 --> 00:37:19.750
Han Gyul, it's time to eat,

597
00:37:21.422 --> 00:37:24.520
Mom made you your favorite meat,

598
00:37:27.462 --> 00:37:29.930
Right, that lady,

599
00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:34.130
Goodness,

600
00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:38.640
Did you sleep well, Han Gyul?

601
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.780
Mom, I didn't wet the bed today,

602
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:44.240
Look,

603
00:37:46.314 --> 00:37:48.950
Goodness, great job,

604
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.880
How unbelievable,

605
00:37:52.654 --> 00:37:53.750
Han Gyul,

606
00:37:54.088 --> 00:37:58.160
You must've been afraid because of the auntie at the kids' cafe,

607
00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:03.030
That auntie came here,,,

608
00:38:03.231 --> 00:38:06.900
and threatened you to say nothing to me, didn't she?

609
00:38:09.337 --> 00:38:11.900
That's why you had nightmares,,,

610
00:38:11.939 --> 00:38:13.870
and wet the bed, isn't it?

611
00:38:14.008 --> 00:38:15.170
Aren't I right?

612
00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:18.440
How did you know?

613
00:38:20.315 --> 00:38:22.720
I know it all because I'm your mom,

614
00:38:23.651 --> 00:38:25.650
You must've been so scared,

615
00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:30.760
Why didn't you tell me about it?

616
00:38:31.459 --> 00:38:33.160
She told me that,,,

617
00:38:33.628 --> 00:38:36.560
she would take me back to the old house if I said anything to you,

618
00:38:37.465 --> 00:38:40.200
Then I wouldn't be able to see,,,

619
00:38:40.268 --> 00:38:42.240
you or Daddy ever again,

620
00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:47.910
So,,, So,,,

621
00:38:49.577 --> 00:38:52.380
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,

622
00:38:53.448 --> 00:38:56.410
I should've done it right beforehand so that it didn't happen,

623
00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:57.720
I'm so sorry,

624
00:38:59.287 --> 00:39:02.650
Han Gyul, Mommy will do better from now on,,,

625
00:39:02.657 --> 00:39:04.820
and make sure no one troubles you, okay?

626
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.760
Really? Can I stay here without going anywhere then?

627
00:39:10.098 --> 00:39:12.570
You won't send me to anywhere, right?

628
00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:13.970
Of course,

629
00:39:14.168 --> 00:39:16.570
You're my daughter, so you won't go anywhere,

630
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:18.070
This is your home,

631
00:39:18.272 --> 00:39:19.700
I won't send you to anywhere,

632
00:39:19.707 --> 00:39:22.810
Come here, my sweetie,

633
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.210
I know you were scared, I'm sorry, It's all right now,

634
00:39:26.481 --> 00:39:29.220
It's all right, Everything is all right now,

635
00:39:29.984 --> 00:39:31.320
It's all good,

636
00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:39.790
Isn't it too bright?

637
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:44.060
It's your first day as an adjunct professor, You need to look bright,

638
00:39:47.869 --> 00:39:49.740
Were you upset yesterday?

639
00:39:51.439 --> 00:39:54.240
I'm sorry that I made you worry,

640
00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:56.110
It's all right,

641
00:39:56.444 --> 00:39:57.940
It's all over now,

642
00:39:58.846 --> 00:40:02.880
Do you think Han Gyul would remember her mother's face?

643
00:40:04.385 --> 00:40:08.180
When I asked her last time, she doesn't seem to remember,

644
00:40:08.189 --> 00:40:09.590
I'm glad to hear that,

645
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.960
I heard kids don't remember anything before four,

646
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.590
I guess it's true,

647
00:40:14.796 --> 00:40:19.070
Honestly, even if she remembers, I want to make her forget,

648
00:40:20.067 --> 00:40:21.970
I was pretty disappointed too,

649
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:26.670
We'd never have to see her again, You should forget about it too,

650
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:33.210
How about we go on a date this weekend to do that?

651
00:40:34.048 --> 00:40:36.580
Just between us? I love it,

652
00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:38.150
Let's go anywhere you want,

653
00:40:38.152 --> 00:40:40.250
Yes! I'm excited,

654
00:40:40.588 --> 00:40:43.990
It's been a while for us to alone together,

655
00:40:44.292 --> 00:40:46.030
You're boring,

656
00:40:46.227 --> 00:40:47.690
You get excited over nothing,

657
00:40:48.062 --> 00:40:49.890
Remember what Father said?

658
00:40:49.897 --> 00:40:52.260
When the husband loves his wife so much,

659
00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:54.660
the wife asks for less,

660
00:40:54.669 --> 00:40:59.170
Now that we're done with Jung Su Mi, I'm perfectly happy,

661
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:01.840
Gosh,

662
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:05.180
You're an idiot, How can you love me so much?

663
00:41:06.948 --> 00:41:08.550
I love Han Gyul too,

664
00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:48.850
(Han Gyul)

665
00:41:48.856 --> 00:41:50.260
Lee Han Gyul,

666
00:41:55.496 --> 00:41:56.660
Su Mi,

667
00:41:58.132 --> 00:41:59.960
Isn't your diabetes level high?

668
00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:01.830
What are you going to do?

669
00:42:02.336 --> 00:42:03.640
Don't worry,

670
00:42:04.138 --> 00:42:07.770
I'm still healthy, I still have a long time before I die,

671
00:42:08.009 --> 00:42:11.110
Why would you die? You haven't lived like a human yet,

672
00:42:11.312 --> 00:42:14.050
You should live your life to the fullest before you die,

673
00:42:14.982 --> 00:42:17.750
You should quit the kids' cafe and look for another job,

674
00:42:17.752 --> 00:42:21.320
No, I even get insurance, It's good money,

675
00:42:22.023 --> 00:42:23.920
I heard life depends on time,

676
00:42:23.925 --> 00:42:25.790
Han Gyul looked so poor when she was with me,

677
00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:27.630
but she looks rich now,

678
00:42:27.728 --> 00:42:30.260
That's all my work, Why should I quit?

679
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:34.160
Honestly, I don't have many days left with her,

680
00:42:34.168 --> 00:42:37.000
I should at least take a picture of her, so you can look at it,

681
00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:39.670
I've warned you,

682
00:42:40.107 --> 00:42:43.610
If you ever talk about Han Gyul again, I'll make you pay,

683
00:42:44.478 --> 00:42:48.140
I don't care about Han Gyul at all,

684
00:42:48.149 --> 00:42:50.380
so don't even think about getting near her, okay?

685
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:58.160
Professor, I loved your lecture today,

686
00:42:59.093 --> 00:43:02.460
Can I email you if I have any questions?

687
00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:04.430
Sure, Anytime,

688
00:43:07.735 --> 00:43:11.340
Patient Kim Yeon Sook in Room 151,

689
00:43:11.772 --> 00:43:15.070
Please come back to the room,

690
00:43:17.878 --> 00:43:19.110
Professor,

691
00:43:20.147 --> 00:43:22.820
Everyone's waiting to have a cup of tea with you,

692
00:43:24.418 --> 00:43:26.890
I'm sorry, Let's have tea next time,

693
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:31.760
Jung Su Mi,

694
00:43:36.397 --> 00:43:39.330
What's going on? What are you doing here?

695
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.730
What do you mean?

696
00:43:41.268 --> 00:43:44.570
Are you saying I should never appear in front of you even by chance?

697
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:47.170
Did you get a restraining order against me?

698
00:43:47.174 --> 00:43:48.340
By chance?

699
00:43:48.943 --> 00:43:51.680
Is it really by chance?

700
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.950
Lee So Won,

701
00:43:56.017 --> 00:43:57.820
I'm sorry if it really is by chance,

702
00:43:58.753 --> 00:44:00.850
But when I think about what you did,

703
00:44:00.921 --> 00:44:03.520
I have no other choice to protect my family,

704
00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:06.630
Right, I admit it's all my fault,

705
00:44:07.194 --> 00:44:09.890
But as I promised,

706
00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:11.630
I will never show my face around you people,

707
00:44:13.668 --> 00:44:15.570
I saw you talking to Ms, Kim,

708
00:44:15.936 --> 00:44:17.340
What brings you here?

709
00:44:17.772 --> 00:44:19.240
Are you sick?

710
00:44:20.207 --> 00:44:21.510
Why would I be?

711
00:44:21.942 --> 00:44:24.680
I'm emigrating, I'm here to get some documents,

712
00:44:25.112 --> 00:44:26.140
Emigrating?

713
00:44:26.147 --> 00:44:27.840
I'm an ex-convict,

714
00:44:27.848 --> 00:44:30.480
I can't get a job or get married in this country,

715
00:44:30.885 --> 00:44:31.980
Is that so?

716
00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:34.520
I'm glad to hear that,

717
00:44:34.522 --> 00:44:37.820
So tell Ha Yeon Ju to relax,

718
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.530
In three months,

719
00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:47.070
I'll be on the road with no return,

720
00:44:48.402 --> 00:44:49.570
Okay,

721
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:52.910
Whatever you go,

722
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:54.910
don't embarrass Han Gyul,

723
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:57.010
Of course,

724
00:44:57.878 --> 00:44:59.950
I'm only 33,

725
00:45:00.381 --> 00:45:03.280
I'll go on dates and get married,

726
00:45:04.151 --> 00:45:05.820
I'll be happy,

727
00:45:06.387 --> 00:45:07.590
Bye,

728
00:45:21.902 --> 00:45:23.070
Han Gyul,

729
00:45:23.904 --> 00:45:25.330
Can I hold your hand?

730
00:45:25.339 --> 00:45:27.670
Sure, Will you hold my hand?

731
00:45:30.377 --> 00:45:32.370
We have to get married now,

732
00:45:32.379 --> 00:45:35.510
Men and women are done when they hold hands,

733
00:45:35.516 --> 00:45:37.880
You're so tacky,

734
00:45:38.419 --> 00:45:40.420
My mom said,,,

735
00:45:40.421 --> 00:45:44.220
I have to date a man through all four seasons,

736
00:46:04.879 --> 00:46:06.210
Miss,

737
00:46:06.547 --> 00:46:10.550
You were with my dad yesterday, right?

738
00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:14.320
No, You're mistaken,

739
00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:21.790
That's strange, It was her,

740
00:46:22.363 --> 00:46:25.130
Han Gyul, Let's go wash our hands,

741
00:46:25.132 --> 00:46:26.330
Okay,

742
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:39.210
Don't get in my way, We graduated from marriage,

743
00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:40.940
Be nice and support me,

744
00:46:40.948 --> 00:46:46.220
I want to burn my last spark,

745
00:46:52.193 --> 00:46:53.890
Here, Shin Mo,

746
00:46:55.629 --> 00:46:58.230
I put in a lot of oysters,

747
00:46:58.232 --> 00:46:59.630
Eat up,

748
00:47:04.939 --> 00:47:06.410
I don't have an appetite,

749
00:47:07.842 --> 00:47:11.040
That reminds me, Is everything all right with you?

750
00:47:11.045 --> 00:47:12.310
Goodness,

751
00:47:13.113 --> 00:47:17.380
You look 10 years older, Your eyes are so sagged,

752
00:47:17.651 --> 00:47:19.820
What's the problem?

753
00:47:21.288 --> 00:47:22.590
My wife,,,

754
00:47:23.357 --> 00:47:25.990
- is about to cheat on me, - Oh, my,

755
00:47:26.861 --> 00:47:30.630
Cheat? My goodness, Oh, dear,

756
00:47:30.631 --> 00:47:32.130
Dirty love?

757
00:47:32.132 --> 00:47:33.330
Yes,

758
00:47:33.901 --> 00:47:36.400
She's going on a business trip,,,

759
00:47:37.137 --> 00:47:40.510
to Ulaanbaatar with that nasty boss,

760
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:44.470
Goodness, What are you going to do?

761
00:47:44.478 --> 00:47:46.240
Oh, my goodness,

762
00:47:46.247 --> 00:47:49.480
Goodness, What are we going to do?

763
00:47:49.483 --> 00:47:51.010
You're in trouble,

764
00:47:51.018 --> 00:47:54.480
I know, right? She's gone too far, right?

765
00:47:54.488 --> 00:47:57.090
Yes, She has,

766
00:47:57.558 --> 00:47:59.860
I'm so jealous,

767
00:48:00.127 --> 00:48:01.930
Oh, dear,

768
00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:06.660
Ms, Hong has a husband, but she's going to,,,

769
00:48:06.667 --> 00:48:09.430
Ulaanbaatar with her boyfriend,,,

770
00:48:09.436 --> 00:48:12.400
where the moonlight is beautiful,

771
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:16.270
Even sterile couples can get pregnant there,

772
00:48:16.277 --> 00:48:18.340
Looking at the moonlight,

773
00:48:18.345 --> 00:48:20.140
they'll eat, chew, drink,,,

774
00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:21.480
Mrs, Yang!

775
00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:24.250
Are you trying to rub it in?

776
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:26.390
That's such a nasty joke,

777
00:48:26.587 --> 00:48:29.790
I love Hong Young Hye sincerely,

778
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:33.820
I realized it at the 7080 cafe,

779
00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:36.560
My spouse for life is Hong Young Hye,

780
00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:39.060
I was wrong until now,

781
00:48:39.066 --> 00:48:41.500
I didn't realize how great she is,

782
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:44.670
I must stop her before it's too late,

783
00:48:44.672 --> 00:48:48.040
Then you should try,

784
00:48:48.042 --> 00:48:50.370
It's too late when she goes to Mongol,

785
00:48:50.377 --> 00:48:52.610
Try it even now,

786
00:48:52.613 --> 00:48:57.150
What? How,,, Do what? How?

787
00:48:57.518 --> 00:49:01.080
I love you, I'm so sorry,

788
00:49:01.088 --> 00:49:03.250
I love you, Young Hye,,,

789
00:49:03.257 --> 00:49:05.590
forever, I told you already!

790
00:49:05.592 --> 00:49:09.830
I want to do that so badly too,

791
00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.830
But it seems Hong Young Hye,,,

792
00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:16.330
wants to be forever with that nasty boss,

793
00:49:16.337 --> 00:49:19.270
If things go well on her business trip,

794
00:49:19.273 --> 00:49:21.840
she said she'll move to Mongol for good,

795
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:25.670
I want to stop her,

796
00:49:25.679 --> 00:49:27.640
but I didn't,,,

797
00:49:27.648 --> 00:49:29.810
because she might say that I haven't changed at all,

798
00:49:29.817 --> 00:49:32.650
This is driving me crazy, I'm going crazy,

799
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:37.220
Gosh, Seriously,

800
00:49:37.257 --> 00:49:39.860
Mrs, Hong probably,,,

801
00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.930
used to live with someone like you,

802
00:49:42.129 --> 00:49:45.690
Of course, she would fall in love,,,

803
00:49:45.699 --> 00:49:48.830
with someone who is kind and polite like him who always says,,,

804
00:49:48.836 --> 00:49:52.400
Please sit down and "Thank you",

805
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:56.910
If I knew this and I was 10 years younger,

806
00:49:56.977 --> 00:50:00.240
I would've used money, beauty, and the help of Mrs, Hong,,,

807
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.480
to seduce him,

808
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.310
I would've been so happy,

809
00:50:05.319 --> 00:50:07.250
Mrs, Yang,

810
00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:09.790
What are you talking about?

811
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:11.290
Do you know how old you are?

812
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:13.920
If you did that right now, you wouldn't be seducing,,,

813
00:50:13.927 --> 00:50:15.930
him with your beauty, You would be seducing him with your age,

814
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:20.030
That's why I'm telling you to get that young girl,

815
00:50:20.067 --> 00:50:22.900
Girl? Young girl?

816
00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:24.030
Who is that?

817
00:50:24.038 --> 00:50:26.470
The thread follows the needle,

818
00:50:32.179 --> 00:50:33.310
Are you a student?

819
00:50:33.313 --> 00:50:35.310
Yes, I'm preparing to become a civil servant,

820
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:37.280
My back hurts so much,

821
00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:39.150
You must be having such a hard time,

822
00:50:39.186 --> 00:50:41.720
It's probably because you're sitting at a desk for so long,

823
00:50:41.922 --> 00:50:43.260
Test it out,

824
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.660
Wait a minute,

825
00:50:49.363 --> 00:50:51.060
Yes, Ru Ri, Why did you call?

826
00:50:51.565 --> 00:50:53.070
Mom, I'm in trouble,

827
00:50:53.767 --> 00:50:57.400
Dad wants to move my stuff to his house and make me commute,

828
00:50:58.439 --> 00:50:59.610
What?

829
00:51:00.207 --> 00:51:01.840
What is he thinking?

830
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.240
- Is that the last box? - Yes,

831
00:51:08.248 --> 00:51:09.310
Let's hurry and go then,

832
00:51:09.316 --> 00:51:11.680
- They might come, - Yes, let's go,

833
00:51:13.987 --> 00:51:15.150
Goodness,

834
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:20.190
Mrs, Yang, what are you doing at my house?

835
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.460
We're about to go and move this,

836
00:51:23.497 --> 00:51:26.130
Can't you see?

837
00:51:27.067 --> 00:51:28.470
We're packing Ru Ri's stuff,

838
00:51:28.902 --> 00:51:30.740
Do you think I'm asking that because I don't know?

839
00:51:31.038 --> 00:51:33.000
Why are you intruding someone else's house to move,,,

840
00:51:33.006 --> 00:51:35.910
my daughter's stuff without asking her permission?

841
00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:37.940
Listen to her speak,

842
00:51:38.112 --> 00:51:41.810
Just because we separated doesn't mean that I'm separated with Ru Ri,

843
00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:45.480
Ru Ri is clearly listed in my register,

844
00:51:45.486 --> 00:51:47.750
and she's my blood daughter,

845
00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:50.160
Of course, you're right,

846
00:51:51.592 --> 00:51:54.790
Is this because what I told you yesterday?

847
00:51:54.795 --> 00:51:56.200
Is it because of my Ulaanbaatar business trip?

848
00:51:56.597 --> 00:51:58.560
You pretended that you agreed yesterday,

849
00:51:59.133 --> 00:52:00.970
and now you're trying to have your own way,

850
00:52:01.668 --> 00:52:04.530
I'm not going to listen to you and cancel my trip because of this,

851
00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:06.800
Not at all, I'm not the old Hong Young Hye,

852
00:52:06.807 --> 00:52:08.200
Don't flatter yourself,

853
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:11.010
I'm also not the old Lee Shin Mo,

854
00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:14.880
I'll completely support your career from now on,

855
00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:16.480
Don't worry, and go on your business trip,

856
00:52:16.483 --> 00:52:19.220
And,,, Here,

857
00:52:19.653 --> 00:52:22.280
I changed some Mongolian money,

858
00:52:22.289 --> 00:52:24.720
Take this,

859
00:52:24.858 --> 00:52:28.290
Don't let your boss always treat you,

860
00:52:28.529 --> 00:52:30.560
Treat him grandly when you're there,

861
00:52:30.998 --> 00:52:32.800
Take it, Let's go,

862
00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:36.900
Tell me,

863
00:52:37.271 --> 00:52:38.830
Why are you doing this?

864
00:52:38.839 --> 00:52:41.110
Do I have to tell you myself?

865
00:52:41.441 --> 00:52:42.670
Tell me,

866
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.040
Why are you doing something out of your character?

867
00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:47.380
What is my character like?

868
00:52:47.714 --> 00:52:51.820
The old Lee Shin Mo is dead,

869
00:52:59.593 --> 00:53:00.890
You won't know,,,

870
00:53:02.229 --> 00:53:06.630
how it feels for a father to see his only daughter get married,

871
00:53:09.536 --> 00:53:10.640
Ru Ri,

872
00:53:11.505 --> 00:53:13.510
Now that you're getting married,

873
00:53:14.174 --> 00:53:17.540
all the things that I haven't done for you are going through my mind,

874
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:22.710
We'll never live together once you become someone else's family,

875
00:53:23.317 --> 00:53:26.350
Until then,

876
00:53:26.653 --> 00:53:28.950
I want to do my best to you,

877
00:53:30.357 --> 00:53:31.860
Ru Ri, look forward to it,

878
00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:38.460
I'm going, Don't come out since it's cold,

879
00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:40.470
- Honey, - No,

880
00:53:41.368 --> 00:53:43.100
Just a moment please,

881
00:53:44.037 --> 00:53:45.500
Didn't you see,,,

882
00:53:45.772 --> 00:53:47.270
the passionate fatherly love?

883
00:53:47.608 --> 00:53:50.940
He gave up,,,

884
00:53:52.045 --> 00:53:53.210
everything about you,

885
00:53:53.814 --> 00:53:56.980
Do whatever you want to do freely with your boyfriend,,,

886
00:53:57.584 --> 00:54:00.850
from now on,

887
00:54:02.856 --> 00:54:06.690
Oh, my, It's so heavy,

888
00:54:09.896 --> 00:54:11.130
What?

889
00:54:12.132 --> 00:54:13.530
Forgot everything?

890
00:54:15.569 --> 00:54:18.640
Why is he acting so cool suddenly?

891
00:54:31.385 --> 00:54:34.850
Are you sure that Young Hye will come back after this?

892
00:54:35.188 --> 00:54:37.220
Listen to me,

893
00:54:37.257 --> 00:54:41.190
It's a skill to cause tension and then relax,

894
00:54:41.295 --> 00:54:43.230
If you make her relax like this,

895
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:45.700
women will want to cause tension,

896
00:54:46.266 --> 00:54:47.730
Okay? Just watch,

897
00:54:48.869 --> 00:54:50.000
- Let's go, - Okay,

898
00:54:50.137 --> 00:54:52.700
This is so heavy, Carry one of these for me,

899
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:55.470
Is it heavy?

900
00:55:00.347 --> 00:55:03.080
Do you know Lee Kyung Hwa from Goldman Partners?

901
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:05.380
I think she's Ae Ri's mother,

902
00:55:18.332 --> 00:55:19.560
How did it go?

903
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.830
Why did you come so late?

904
00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:26.370
Do you know how much she waited for you until the end?

905
00:55:27.607 --> 00:55:29.270
Why did you come now?

906
00:55:31.978 --> 00:55:34.780
Did she already pass away?

907
00:55:52.632 --> 00:55:53.930
Did you ask for me?

908
00:55:55.402 --> 00:55:56.600
Do you know,,,

909
00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:01.610
Lee Kyung Hwa from Goldman Partners?

910
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:03.940
Lee Kyung Hwa?

911
00:56:05.545 --> 00:56:06.710
I'm not sure,

912
00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.150
I've never seen her because I'm not in charge of that part,

913
00:56:10.817 --> 00:56:12.680
- Really? - Yes,

914
00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.850
Why are you asking that suddenly?

915
00:56:16.089 --> 00:56:18.420
Never mind, How is the preparation of the board of director's meeting?

916
00:56:18.959 --> 00:56:20.890
All of them will attend today,

917
00:56:24.731 --> 00:56:25.960
Look at this,

918
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.410
This is the list of the employees of the opening tomorrow,

919
00:56:34.207 --> 00:56:38.040
But Go Jung Do is listed as the general manager,

920
00:56:39.613 --> 00:56:41.210
Did you know that?

921
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:46.380
I left everything about that to Tae Yang,

922
00:56:46.787 --> 00:56:49.350
Whoever Tae Yang chooses to employ is up to him,

923
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:51.020
so don't worry about it,

924
00:56:54.628 --> 00:56:56.460
Okay,

925
00:57:11.378 --> 00:57:12.540
It's me,

926
00:57:13.647 --> 00:57:15.780
I think Jung Tae Yang found out,

927
00:57:16.583 --> 00:57:17.680
Be careful,

928
00:57:17.818 --> 00:57:22.020
(Goldman Partners)

929
00:57:22.022 --> 00:57:25.020
Don't worry, I expected that much,

930
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:44.540
This can't be ruined when we're almost there,

931
00:58:03.697 --> 00:58:07.830
Kevin has quite a smart son seeing that he came here,

932
00:58:08.568 --> 00:58:11.000
He's the perfect match for Ae Ri,

933
00:58:11.338 --> 00:58:12.500
Let's go,

934
00:58:31.191 --> 00:58:33.430
Are you here to meet the manager?

935
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:36.460
Is her name Lee Kyung Hwa?

936
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:40.030
Yes, but she quit a while ago,

937
00:58:40.467 --> 00:58:41.630
What?

938
00:58:43.336 --> 00:58:45.500
Where can we meet her?

939
00:58:46.406 --> 00:58:47.910
Are you from SC Food and Beverage?

940
00:58:48.775 --> 00:58:50.180
You'll meet her soon,

941
00:58:50.477 --> 00:58:53.550
She just told me to tell you that,

942
00:58:54.147 --> 00:58:55.310
That's it,

943
00:58:59.886 --> 00:59:01.490
What does that mean?

(Joo Ae Ri)

948
00:59:38.592 --> 00:59:39.690
I'm going to watch and see,

949
00:59:40.026 --> 00:59:42.590
I'll be watching how nicely you do your job this time,

950
00:59:43.296 --> 00:59:45.090
You and Jung Tae Yang's lives,,,

951
00:59:45.098 --> 00:59:47.900
will depend on the result of the New City branch,

952
00:59:48.234 --> 00:59:50.140
Make sure you make no mistakes this time,

953
01:00:01.047 --> 01:00:03.820
The meat still looks fresh and has a perfect color,

954
01:00:04.317 --> 01:00:08.320
You know our pork tastes the best in the country,

955
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.990
That's why I've been doing business with you for 10 years,

956
01:00:12.759 --> 01:00:16.190
It's for the opening event, so please give us the best meat,

957
01:00:16.229 --> 01:00:17.730
Don't worry,

958
01:00:17.731 --> 01:00:18.800
All right,

959
01:00:37.751 --> 01:00:39.220
Thank you for showing me your products,

960
01:00:39.819 --> 01:00:41.480
We plan to cook the meat early in the morning,

961
01:00:41.488 --> 01:00:43.590
so please deliver it by 7am tomorrow,

962
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:47.090
Okay, It's matured for two days, so it'll be perfect for cooking,

963
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.020
- Thank you, - Pleasure is mine,

964
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:50.060
Bye,

965
01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:02.110
How did it go? Did you find anything about Susanna?

966
01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:05.370
She resigned from her manager position not long ago,

967
01:01:05.378 --> 01:01:08.810
She left a message that we'd see her soon,

968
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:10.580
We'd see her soon?

969
01:01:11.217 --> 01:01:12.580
What does that mean?

970
01:01:20.126 --> 01:01:22.530
Sir, the directors' meeting will begin soon,

971
01:01:23.129 --> 01:01:24.760
Let's talk after the meeting,

972
01:01:26.332 --> 01:01:28.130
Wait a second,

973
01:01:33.039 --> 01:01:34.340
There you go,

974
01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:36.370
You look cool,

975
01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:38.770
Congratulations on your official promotion,

976
01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.380
It's burdensome to be honest,

977
01:01:40.714 --> 01:01:42.650
I'm not sure if I can do a proper job,

978
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:47.250
Don't worry, You just have to do as you have done,

979
01:01:47.587 --> 01:01:50.520
Your time will start from today on for real,

980
01:01:50.523 --> 01:01:52.350
Show them what you've got in SC,

981
01:01:52.358 --> 01:01:54.360
I'll provide a successful result for the New City branch,

982
01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.800
I'll prove that I'm your competent son,

983
01:01:57.997 --> 01:01:59.800
I'll be looking forward to that,

984
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:10.640
The chairman is here,

985
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:19.050
Let me introduce you to my son, Director Jung Tae Yang,

986
01:02:20.253 --> 01:02:22.320
Hello, I'm Jung Tae Yang,

987
01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:24.620
- It's nice to meet you, - It's nice to meet you,

988
01:02:28.595 --> 01:02:31.900
Where's the chief director of Goldman Partners?

989
01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:35.930
I got a call that the newly appointed chief director is coming,

990
01:02:36.469 --> 01:02:38.900
Who's newly appointed?

991
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:43.240
She's there,

992
01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:06.390
Hello,

993
01:03:06.399 --> 01:03:10.000
I'm Lee Kyung Hwa, the new chief director of Goldman Partners,

994
01:03:25.151 --> 01:03:27.390
(Man Who Sets the Table)

995
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520
It's the document from the States,

996
01:03:28.521 --> 01:03:30.850
These two people look exactly the same,

997
01:03:30.857 --> 01:03:34.520
That's my Eun Jo,

998
01:03:34.527 --> 01:03:35.690
Are you done with the preparation?

999
01:03:35.695 --> 01:03:37.230
We need to reveal it quickly,

1000
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.990
You must not make any mistake,

1001
01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:42.000
It says the chief technician is Jung Soo Ae,

1002
01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:44.030
Is something wrong with Han Gyul?

1003
01:03:44.037 --> 01:03:46.940
We've received a report that you're lying about its place of origin,

1004
01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.600
Illegal distribution? What are you talking about?

1005
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:51.610
It's my first time seeing you,

1006
01:03:51.611 --> 01:03:53.980
but you look familiar,

1007
01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.310
Same here, I feel like I've met you before,

1008
01:03:57.317 --> 01:03:59.780
I'm trying to remember where we've met,

1009
01:04:01.888 --> 01:04:05.320
