1
00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.100
Wow, it's cold!

2
00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:31.475
Why is it so cold?

3
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.517
Eun-ho! What are you doing out here?
It's freezing!

4
00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:35.392
<i>- Episode 3 -</i>
Welcome home!

5
00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:39.350
Why were you shivering out in the cold?

6
00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:42.642
Can't believe how expensive
onions are these days!

7
00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:44.684
I'll head upstairs now.

8
00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:45.809
Sure! Get some rest.

9
00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:47.434
That was strange of him…

10
00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:50.183
Everyone! Gather around!

11
00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.976
Mo Pil-tae's got great speed
and concentration to boot.

12
00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:55.517
However, he's got weak stamina.

13
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:59.851
There you have it! My competitor analysis
for the qualification match!

14
00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:02.934
Let me get this straight…
You organized all these?

15
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.059
The physiques, records, and styles
of all major speed skaters in the world?

16
00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:11.684
And ours as well?

17
00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:12.475
Yup!

18
00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:15.809
That's my Man-hee…
Always on top of things!

19
00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.934
All those videos and books…

20
00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.225
all that information you've been organizing
was for this?

21
00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:23.475
Well I am a sports medicine major.

22
00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:25.892
So I did a little analysis of
all your physiques,

23
00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:28.601
including what your weaknesses are
compared to other global athletes.

24
00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:35.350
So based on your analysis,
my competition management

25
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.309
needs more work, right?
And my physique is set?

26
00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:38.142
Nope.

27
00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:41.659
Your major strengths are
naturally great response and speed.

28
00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.151
You can improve on your competition skills
by practicing with Eun-ho.

29
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:47.350
Because that's Eun-ho's forte.

30
00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:51.617
As for Eun-ho, you need to
manage your stamina until the end.

31
00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:53.183
Also, your lower body is especially weak.

32
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
The coaching staff will take care of it.

33
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.099
It's not like I wasn't aware of it.
Is that all?

34
00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:07.976
What are you staring so hard at?

35
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.934
Oh, it's an audition poster.

36
00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.100
I mean, why are you staring
at a poster like that?

37
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.767
Was I?

38
00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:19.559
Yeah, like, real hard.

39
00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:28.809
I'm going to look at it every day
while practicing!

40
00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:52.684
Ugh, what a mess…

41
00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:57.267
She should have cleaned this up

42
00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:01.142
and put everything back before heading up.

43
00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:13.892
Huh? It's gone!

44
00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.183
Oh, this is bad!

45
00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.809
Who erased the board?

46
00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:21.892
Argh!

47
00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:31.183
Hey, the heater's on, right?

48
00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:33.726
Yeah. It's all the way up.

49
00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.183
We are covering ourselves
with this blanket, right?

50
00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:41.018
A pretty hefty blanket, too.

51
00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:44.726
What's this? Siberia?

52
00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:46.726
It's like we're back at the training camp…

53
00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:50.018
You think so too?

54
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.809
A little chilly, right?

55
00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.225
Totally…

56
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:58.267
So we have to sleep here, right?

57
00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:05.059
Sounds impossible, am I right?

58
00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:07.517
I can't take this anymore!

59
00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:31.225
Wow, it's cold!

60
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.601
So cold!

61
00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:39.809
What the heck, you two!

62
00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:41.517
It's super warm here!

63
00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:45.225
Hey, that room is freezing!

64
00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:47.099
We're sleeping here tonight.

65
00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.267
Eun-ho, please! Just for a few days!

66
00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:50.767
The boiler's broken over there…

67
00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:54.809
Ridiculous... This is your room!

68
00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:55.934
Not right now, it isn't.

69
00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:58.099
I'm paying to board here, remember?

70
00:04:58.392 --> 00:05:01.601
So is that a no?

71
00:05:01.642 --> 00:05:03.642
That's right. Especially not him.

72
00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.267
That Q-tip head…

73
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.809
Can we change your mind somehow?

74
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.642
That room is unbearable…

75
00:05:11.642 --> 00:05:13.059
Not for free.

76
00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.350
What do you want?

77
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.475
Can I ask anything?

78
00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:19.392
Sure! Sure!

79
00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:22.517
This is what I want…

80
00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:25.059
Hey, Ho-young! I…

81
00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.726
Good morning, Ji-na!
Did you sleep well?

82
00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:29.976
Oh, hi, Eun-ho!
Hey, Ho-young, I…

83
00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:36.809
Oh, um… I'm running a bit late.
See you!

84
00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.183
This is what I want.

85
00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:46.225
What is it?

86
00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:50.392
Ho-young. Don't speak with Ji-na again.

87
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.851
Wait, no. Don't even meet her anywhere.

88
00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:55.559
How is that even possible?
We live in the same house!

89
00:05:56.267 --> 00:05:57.976
Then you can stay at a different house.

90
00:05:57.976 --> 00:05:59.225
Hey, what are you…

91
00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.434
Anyway, no speaking with her!
No meeting up with her!

92
00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:05.642
If you don't like that,
you can sleep outside.

93
00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:07.059
What are you, a kid?
That's cheap!

94
00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:08.434
Yeah, I'm cheap.

95
00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.851
If you don't like it, get out of here!

96
00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:14.018
I'm going to kill this guy… Hey!

97
00:06:14.018 --> 00:06:17.559
Wait, no! We'll freeze to death out there!

98
00:06:21.434 --> 00:06:23.267
Hey, you should have waited for us.

99
00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:26.018
You headed out without even seeing me!

100
00:06:26.642 --> 00:06:27.809
Here, drink this!

101
00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:37.350
That's my Ho-young!

102
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.267
What about me?

103
00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:39.767
You had one already!

104
00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:42.267
Well, I want another one.

105
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:44.684
I'm disappointed…

106
00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:55.642
- Ugh…
- What?

107
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:57.392
Can't wait to see today's schedule…

108
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.309
I can't wait to see what's for dinner.

109
00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:04.100
Remember that spicy pork?
Did we get more of that?

110
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:06.059
That was so good, right?

111
00:07:15.642 --> 00:07:17.517
Excuse me!

112
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:39.392
I checked out the boarding house
Eun-ho is staying at.

113
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:42.684
It didn't look like the best environment…

114
00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:45.100
I think you should call him back.

115
00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.892
Is he training at the center?

116
00:07:48.892 --> 00:07:50.684
Huh? Yes, of course.

117
00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:56.684
Let's try working as a team today,
just as we practiced.

118
00:07:56.684 --> 00:08:01.601
Eun-ho and Ho-young. Check each other's
pace and adjust your speed.

119
00:08:02.434 --> 00:08:06.642
Everyone else, remember your own pace!

120
00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:08.309
All right, everyone get ready!

121
00:08:15.392 --> 00:08:16.059
Coach!

122
00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.851
Get ready!

123
00:09:36.434 --> 00:09:37.976
He's a good skater!

124
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.350
Coach Son's indeed got an eye for talent.

125
00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:41.475
It's just a practice.

126
00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:43.851
Today's results don't really matter…

127
00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:46.267
A pro should practice
like it's a competition!

128
00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:48.142
There can only be one first place.

129
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.059
That boy needs more practice.

130
00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:55.892
That's good! Focus!

131
00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:57.601
Let's do five sets of this,

132
00:09:57.601 --> 00:09:59.642
- and we'll call it a day.
- Thank you!

133
00:10:05.392 --> 00:10:07.309
Working hard, I see.

134
00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:08.475
- Hello!
- Yes, yes...

135
00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:15.309
You know we have high hopes for you, right?

136
00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:18.018
Thank you! I'll do my best!

137
00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:22.934
Eun-ho is a world-class skater.

138
00:10:24.018 --> 00:10:26.350
He's sure to win a medal at
the upcoming PyeongChang Olympics.

139
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:31.099
No, not just a medal. A gold medal!

140
00:10:33.392 --> 00:10:35.934
You should perform your tasks
as a pacesetter.

141
00:10:35.934 --> 00:10:38.018
Match Eun-ho's speed!

142
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.892
Match his stamina!
Make sure he performs well!

143
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.018
Don't try to win yourself!

144
00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:55.726
So you want me to lose on purpose?

145
00:10:55.726 --> 00:10:58.559
No, not lose on purpose!

146
00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:02.475
But if you have to lose, you should lose.

147
00:11:02.684 --> 00:11:04.267
Take Eun-ho to the first place!

148
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:07.392
That's the job of a pacesetter!

149
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.934
What?

150
00:11:09.642 --> 00:11:11.601
There's no such thing as having to lose.

151
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.099
Why, that little…

152
00:11:26.517 --> 00:11:27.976
Yes, chairman…

153
00:11:28.517 --> 00:11:29.642
Yes…

154
00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.809
Eun-ho?

155
00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:34.809
Sure, I know.

156
00:11:36.142 --> 00:11:37.267
Right now?

157
00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:46.559
Why is that car lurking around here?

158
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.267
Hey!

159
00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:00.601
Yes?

160
00:12:00.642 --> 00:12:01.892
Hold on a second…

161
00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:04.892
You don't look like
one of those loan sharks…

162
00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:06.934
Who are you?
Why are you lurking around here?

163
00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:11.183
Ma'am. That's no reason to
knock on someone's car…

164
00:12:11.183 --> 00:12:15.018
Your car is sitting
right in front of my restaurant!

165
00:12:15.018 --> 00:12:17.392
What's you and your car doing here anyway?

166
00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:19.559
I'll get out.

167
00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:20.601
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:32.183 --> 00:12:33.684
Eun-ho!

169
00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:51.601
You must be starving!
Here, try this.

170
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:57.018
Should have told me you were visiting!
I would've prepared something better.

171
00:13:02.183 --> 00:13:02.934
Please, enjoy.

172
00:13:02.934 --> 00:13:04.601
- Please, eat.
- Yes, thank you.

173
00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:06.809
- Please, eat.
- Yes, thank you.

174
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.183
Oh this… Eun-ho really likes this one.

175
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.059
It's good for athletes, I heard…

176
00:13:18.099 --> 00:13:19.309
Here, eat!

177
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.392
Let's eat now.

178
00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:33.267
Yes, please eat.

179
00:13:49.183 --> 00:13:51.018
It's nice and cozy, this house…

180
00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:55.309
Stop this and come back home now.

181
00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:57.684
The qualification match is coming up soon.

182
00:13:57.684 --> 00:13:59.976
You need to manage
your daily schedule as well.

183
00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:01.767
I am managing myself.
Especially training…

184
00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.726
Is that why you lost today?

185
00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:08.475
It was a practice.

186
00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:10.684
I told you to practice like
you are really competing.

187
00:14:13.225 --> 00:14:14.892
You haven't changed…

188
00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:16.350
No more back talk. Come back home.

189
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.976
Or you won't have time to train properly.

190
00:14:17.976 --> 00:14:19.225
Not to mention managing your condition.

191
00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.434
No. I'm not going back.

192
00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:22.976
What?

193
00:14:23.475 --> 00:14:27.434
I like it here.
This how a person should live.

194
00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:32.099
Everyone's good to me.
The meals are delicious.

195
00:14:33.018 --> 00:14:35.183
What? I don't feed you well enough at home?

196
00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:37.892
Come home.
What can you possibly gain from boarding?

197
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.684
You know our house is bad.
The atmosphere, I mean.

198
00:14:46.726 --> 00:14:50.309
So you still couldn't find
that money-stealing weasel?

199
00:14:50.892 --> 00:14:54.018
She knew what that money was for,
and still ran with it!

200
00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:56.350
I really have to find her!

201
00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.142
No, I won't hold it for long.
Just some emergency loan…

202
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.225
Otherwise I'll get into a real big trouble!

203
00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:05.684
You know this is my brother's place…

204
00:15:05.684 --> 00:15:09.684
Manager!
Seize Eun-ho's credit card! Now!

205
00:15:09.684 --> 00:15:11.976
He wants to live on his own.
He won't need my help!

206
00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:27.267
But what should we get your mom
for her birthday?

207
00:15:27.267 --> 00:15:29.934
All you have to do is just help.

208
00:15:29.934 --> 00:15:32.183
I'm preparing the gift with Man-hee.

209
00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:34.559
You meet up with Man-hee and Ji-na,
get her gift

210
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.892
and then just enjoy the dinner.

211
00:15:35.892 --> 00:15:38.225
But it's her birthday.
Shouldn't it be just family?

212
00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:39.100
I'm not sure if I…

213
00:15:39.142 --> 00:15:42.099
Hey, you are already our family!

214
00:15:42.099 --> 00:15:44.434
Do you know how much my mom
worries about you?

215
00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:46.809
Oh, come on…

216
00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:49.767
- Let's go, friend!
- Let's go.

217
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:54.309
Hey, Eun-ho!

218
00:15:56.559 --> 00:16:01.225
Your dad may talk to you like that,

219
00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:03.267
but it's because he worries about you.

220
00:16:03.934 --> 00:16:05.099
Yes…

221
00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:09.559
Now I know where you got that
handsome face from.

222
00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:11.392
It was your dad!

223
00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:15.851
So your dad is the chairman of
the Kangbaek Foundation?

224
00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:17.809
Yes…

225
00:16:20.142 --> 00:16:21.934
I see…
Oh, headed to the training center?

226
00:16:21.934 --> 00:16:26.142
I'm also going to
get some exercise for once.

227
00:16:26.142 --> 00:16:28.142
I'll get going then.

228
00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:35.601
He's so handsome and polite…

229
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:38.183
Looks like he got it all from his dad.

230
00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:42.225
That was one handsome dad…

231
00:16:42.976 --> 00:16:44.018
Exactly my type!

232
00:16:56.059 --> 00:16:57.517
You know what today is!

233
00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.475
- Mom's birthday!
- Aunt's birthday!

234
00:16:59.475 --> 00:17:01.100
So we prepared a little event!

235
00:17:05.434 --> 00:17:07.099
Eun-ho! Over here!

236
00:17:17.892 --> 00:17:19.767
Are the kids here?
No one?

237
00:17:19.809 --> 00:17:20.892
Is no one here?

238
00:17:20.892 --> 00:17:22.809
All the lights are off too…

239
00:17:29.726 --> 00:17:31.684
Happy birthday, aunt!

240
00:17:31.726 --> 00:17:33.642
Happy birthday, mom!

241
00:17:35.018 --> 00:17:36.684
It's not much, but here…

242
00:17:36.684 --> 00:17:38.183
Happy birthday!

243
00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.934
Surprising me like this, all of you…

244
00:17:42.517 --> 00:17:44.309
Happy birthday!

245
00:17:44.684 --> 00:17:46.267
I bought this with
the money I got from work!

246
00:17:46.267 --> 00:17:47.726
It's really good!

247
00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:49.517
Happy birthday!

248
00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:51.059
Next time, I'm going to get you
something bigger,

249
00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:52.851
something a lot better! Okay?

250
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.183
Nonsense!
Not like I did much for you…

251
00:17:55.392 --> 00:17:57.099
Ma'am, happy birthday!

252
00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:04.809
I'm so grateful. You've been so good.
Thank you. All of you.

253
00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:06.392
You are all so kind…

254
00:18:06.392 --> 00:18:08.809
- Mom is crying!
- She's crying!

255
00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:10.350
You have to blow the candles!

256
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.642
One, two, three!

257
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.350
Happy birthday!

258
00:18:17.392 --> 00:18:19.851
- Thank you!
- Happy birthday, mom!

259
00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:21.100
Mom! I know you like karaoke!

260
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.225
Let's go! What do you say?

261
00:18:22.225 --> 00:18:23.059
Oh, should we?

262
00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:26.142
Yes! The karaoke is on me!

263
00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:29.350
Save it up for the audition!

264
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.225
Tonight's karaoke is on me!

265
00:20:00.809 --> 00:20:02.309
Sit down, Man-bok!

266
00:20:15.392 --> 00:20:20.475
You are pretty today.
Like you were yesterday.

267
00:20:21.142 --> 00:20:25.018
No, you are even prettier today.

268
00:20:25.018 --> 00:20:30.475
When I say these, you always

269
00:20:30.475 --> 00:20:34.684
ignore it, and change the subject.

270
00:20:34.684 --> 00:20:39.684
I had a nice dream last night.

271
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.517
I can't tell you right now.

272
00:20:42.517 --> 00:20:46.100
It's too embarrassing.

273
00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:54.642
And I shouldn't reveal my dreams.

274
00:20:54.642 --> 00:20:57.934
A dream I'll never dream again.

275
00:20:57.934 --> 00:21:00.309
Such a pleasant dream.

276
00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:04.517
I feel like it really is you.

277
00:21:04.517 --> 00:21:07.934
A dream that stays in my head all day.

278
00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.392
Such a pleasant dream.

279
00:21:10.434 --> 00:21:14.183
That's you!

280
00:21:14.517 --> 00:21:18.392
I got all the stress out of my system
thanks to you all!

281
00:21:18.392 --> 00:21:21.309
Wait till I get that medal, mom.
I'll take of you good.

282
00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:23.183
That's my Man-bok!

283
00:21:23.183 --> 00:21:24.892
I should just study harder

284
00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:26.809
and get a good job. That'd be faster.

285
00:21:26.809 --> 00:21:28.434
What? You don't trust your brother?

286
00:21:28.434 --> 00:21:30.099
Just stating the fact!

287
00:21:33.434 --> 00:21:35.475
Oh, you kids head back in.

288
00:21:35.475 --> 00:21:37.475
I have to see Kim at the supermarket…

289
00:21:37.475 --> 00:21:39.267
I mean, at the hair salon.

290
00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:40.392
Go on! Go on!

291
00:21:40.434 --> 00:21:41.267
It's cold, mom! Come back soon!

292
00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:42.684
Yes, come back soon!

293
00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:44.059
Come back soon!

294
00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:52.225
How did it go? Did they find her?

295
00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:54.892
No?

296
00:21:55.142 --> 00:21:57.767
Okay… Bye.

297
00:22:05.099 --> 00:22:06.183
Hello?

298
00:22:08.726 --> 00:22:11.059
Just give me a few more days…

299
00:22:11.099 --> 00:22:12.809
I swear I'll pay back.

300
00:22:13.434 --> 00:22:16.099
Please? Just a few days…

301
00:22:18.018 --> 00:22:20.018
Of course I'll pay everything!

302
00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:22.142
Yes!

303
00:22:22.851 --> 00:22:24.851
Please! I beg you!

304
00:22:38.642 --> 00:22:41.018
Just give me a few more days…

305
00:22:41.018 --> 00:22:42.559
I swear I'll pay back.

306
00:22:43.434 --> 00:22:46.225
Please? Just a few days…

307
00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:52.726
The days are flying by,
and we still have no word of her.

308
00:22:52.726 --> 00:22:56.099
I'm going crazier by the day!

309
00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:59.309
Is there any way we can
get some emergency loan?

310
00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:02.809
I need whatever we can find…

311
00:23:02.851 --> 00:23:03.892
Yes.

312
00:23:04.267 --> 00:23:07.976
I wouldn't even tell you this
if it weren't an emergency!

313
00:23:07.976 --> 00:23:13.018
That's what drives me crazy!
What if the kids find out?

314
00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:19.267
Let's ask around… every penny would help.

315
00:23:21.642 --> 00:23:25.517
One! Two!

316
00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:27.225
Eyes to the front!

317
00:23:27.225 --> 00:23:28.601
Three!

318
00:23:29.225 --> 00:23:31.225
One!

319
00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:33.225
Man-bok! You are getting shaky!

320
00:23:33.267 --> 00:23:37.767
One! Two!

321
00:23:38.099 --> 00:23:41.350
Hey, what's wrong? You are not focusing!

322
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.099
It's… nothing.

323
00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:45.142
Three!

324
00:23:46.309 --> 00:23:47.642
Attention!

325
00:23:50.434 --> 00:23:51.559
The qualification match is coming up.

326
00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:53.934
Thanks to the Olympics,
the press is focusing on how we're doing.

327
00:23:53.934 --> 00:23:57.517
So we're having a friendly match
with the Star Sports Foundation Team.

328
00:23:58.434 --> 00:24:00.934
Don't push yourself too hard
and end up getting injured. Got it?

329
00:24:02.392 --> 00:24:03.726
I'm talking about you!

330
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.434
Take special care not to get injured!
Am I clear?

331
00:24:07.434 --> 00:24:08.601
Yes, coach!

332
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.350
Gather at the rink by 14:00 after lunch!

333
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.934
Dismiss!

334
00:24:12.099 --> 00:24:13.392
Dismiss!

335
00:24:15.392 --> 00:24:16.726
- Aren't you eating?
- You go on ahead.

336
00:24:16.767 --> 00:24:17.392
Yes, coach.

337
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:26.434
Man-bok! Time for lunch!

338
00:24:28.018 --> 00:24:29.350
I'm not really hungry.

339
00:24:30.684 --> 00:24:33.267
You? What are you talking about?

340
00:24:33.267 --> 00:24:34.517
Come on. Let's go.

341
00:24:34.642 --> 00:24:36.642
No, I'm really not hungry.

342
00:24:40.225 --> 00:24:44.059
What's gotten into you? What's going on?

343
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.059
Just a little headache.
I'll be fine after a bit of rest.

344
00:24:51.767 --> 00:24:52.517
All right.

345
00:24:53.684 --> 00:24:55.018
If you don't feel well,

346
00:24:55.099 --> 00:24:57.809
tell the coach and
get some rest this afternoon.

347
00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:00.309
I can take care of myself.

348
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:02.809
I'll be going, then.

349
00:25:26.018 --> 00:25:29.350
Can I talk to you for a minute?

350
00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:35.267
What do you mean?

351
00:25:39.142 --> 00:25:40.851
Depending on how you do…

352
00:25:42.726 --> 00:25:44.517
we can take care of your debt.

353
00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:08.541

354
00:26:38.434 --> 00:26:41.392
Um… I'm here for lunch.

355
00:26:45.517 --> 00:26:46.934
You can sit over there.

356
00:26:51.434 --> 00:26:52.976
Do you know what time it is?

357
00:26:52.976 --> 00:26:55.267
How come you haven't eaten yet?

358
00:26:57.099 --> 00:26:59.225
Well, I just missed the timing…

359
00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:01.559
A rich man like you

360
00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:03.684
missing out on lunch?

361
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.559
Anyway, like father, like son, I guess.

362
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.434
You both eat like champions!

363
00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:17.684
How much do I owe you?

364
00:27:19.684 --> 00:27:21.601
Are all rich people like this?

365
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:23.601
Trying to solve things with money first?

366
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:27.559
I can't charge you!
You are Eun-ho's dad!

367
00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:38.309
Please, take care of Eun-ho…

368
00:27:39.267 --> 00:27:41.309
He's… a bit on the weaker side.

369
00:27:41.934 --> 00:27:44.099
Please, at least let him eat right.

370
00:27:46.183 --> 00:27:50.350
Come on... What's this…

371
00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.559
Now that the press is focusing on us,

372
00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:10.475
we have to make Eun-ho stand out.

373
00:28:11.726 --> 00:28:14.099
The chairman is very keen on this as well.

374
00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:15.684
Eun-ho is doing fine.

375
00:28:15.684 --> 00:28:17.267
Doing fine is not good enough!

376
00:28:17.267 --> 00:28:18.726
That's now how the press sees him.

377
00:28:18.767 --> 00:28:20.767
People still think he hasn't
gotten out of his slump.

378
00:28:21.475 --> 00:28:22.684
What I'm saying is…

379
00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:26.976
How about we exclude Ho-young
from this match?

380
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.142
So, just to make Eun-ho stand out,

381
00:28:30.183 --> 00:28:31.642
you want to exclude Ho-young?

382
00:28:31.642 --> 00:28:34.642
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.

383
00:28:34.642 --> 00:28:36.851
He'll be like our secret weapon!

384
00:28:36.851 --> 00:28:38.767
We are just not revealing him right now!

385
00:28:41.018 --> 00:28:43.018
Do your best. Show us what you've got!

386
00:28:43.142 --> 00:28:44.517
Race with confidence!

387
00:28:44.892 --> 00:28:46.851
Don't mind that whole pacesetter thing!

388
00:29:09.183 --> 00:29:10.642
Just do as I say,

389
00:29:12.475 --> 00:29:15.018
and we'll take care of the debt.

390
00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:51.059
About what you said earlier…
What do you want me to do?

391
00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:56.392
You know Eun-ho is our star athlete.

392
00:29:56.392 --> 00:29:58.642
Ho-young is his pacesetter.

393
00:29:58.642 --> 00:30:02.517
We don't want those two on the same track.

394
00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:04.976
If you can make that happen…

395
00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:10.851
We'll give you enough money
to clear your mother's debt.

396
00:30:14.099 --> 00:30:16.767
Take it easy. It's just a friendly match.

397
00:30:17.225 --> 00:30:20.934
Doesn't matter if it's friendly.
I have to do my best!

398
00:30:23.976 --> 00:30:26.642
They say I'm a rising star.

399
00:30:26.684 --> 00:30:28.767
I have to show them what I can do.

400
00:30:31.517 --> 00:30:33.684
You are Eun-ho's pacesetter, after all.

401
00:30:33.684 --> 00:30:35.225
Don't push yourself too hard.
What if you get injured?

402
00:30:35.225 --> 00:30:37.225
Hey, no worries.

403
00:30:37.267 --> 00:30:39.267
I've been playing on ice since I was a kid.

404
00:30:39.267 --> 00:30:41.267
Never got injured once.

405
00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:43.267
You know that.

406
00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:47.934
Ho-young…

407
00:30:49.517 --> 00:30:52.225
Can you please let Eun-ho win?
Just this once?

408
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:55.726
You know his dad is the chairman here.

409
00:30:57.142 --> 00:30:58.517
What's wrong with you?

410
00:31:00.517 --> 00:31:01.767
No, think about it!

411
00:31:02.225 --> 00:31:03.684
The qualification match is coming up soon.

412
00:31:03.684 --> 00:31:06.559
If you try too hard here,
you might get injured…

413
00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.601
I won't! Don't worry!

414
00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:10.767
This is like a pre-match test!

415
00:31:10.767 --> 00:31:12.892
A chance to check up on my skills.
That's what it is.

416
00:31:13.434 --> 00:31:14.934
I won't push myself too hard.

417
00:31:19.059 --> 00:31:21.517
Can we please let Eun-ho shine
just this once?

418
00:31:22.976 --> 00:31:24.809
He's the top ranking skater in the world!

419
00:31:30.934 --> 00:31:33.099
Seriously! What's wrong with you today?

420
00:31:36.099 --> 00:31:38.892
Has living together
brought you guys that close?

421
00:31:38.892 --> 00:31:39.976
Is he your best friend now?

422
00:31:40.309 --> 00:31:42.892
So what? You want me to lose on purpose?

423
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.642
Just today…

424
00:31:48.142 --> 00:31:50.350
Please! Just today!

425
00:31:53.642 --> 00:31:55.642
There's no such thing as having to lose.

426
00:31:56.099 --> 00:32:00.309
I'll win no matter what,
even if it's just to feel better.

427
00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:13.018
It's a friendly match, so don't overdo it.

428
00:32:13.018 --> 00:32:14.642
But don't go easy, either.

429
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:17.225
Everyone, please do your best.

430
00:32:17.225 --> 00:32:19.059
Show the power of Korean skaters

431
00:32:19.099 --> 00:32:20.726
to everyone out there!

432
00:32:21.142 --> 00:32:21.934
Ready!

433
00:32:22.267 --> 00:32:24.018
To the starting line!

434
00:33:21.517 --> 00:33:22.559
Man-bok!

435
00:33:27.517 --> 00:33:28.099
Are you okay?

436
00:33:30.018 --> 00:33:30.934
Where does it hurt?

437
00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:55.350
Thankfully it's nothing serious.

438
00:33:57.934 --> 00:33:58.559
Okay…

439
00:33:58.601 --> 00:34:00.601
I know you two are close.

440
00:34:01.434 --> 00:34:03.767
But you can't forfeit a race like that.

441
00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.183
That's not what a professional does.

442
00:34:06.934 --> 00:34:08.099
I'm sorry.

443
00:34:08.309 --> 00:34:09.350
Are you?

444
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.684
You should have raced until the end!

445
00:34:14.267 --> 00:34:16.809
But why did Man-bok

446
00:34:16.809 --> 00:34:18.267
race like that? Do you know?

447
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:22.142
That was too aggressive…

448
00:34:22.142 --> 00:34:23.892
That's not what I taught him.

449
00:34:27.809 --> 00:34:29.809
Anyway, let's continue tomorrow.

450
00:34:30.225 --> 00:34:31.309
Take care of Man-bok.

451
00:34:31.309 --> 00:34:32.309
Yes, coach. See you tomorrow.

452
00:34:48.642 --> 00:34:50.059
Good. Good.

453
00:34:51.642 --> 00:34:54.726
Yes! That's good…

454
00:34:57.434 --> 00:34:58.976
Oh, come in! Come in!

455
00:34:59.475 --> 00:35:00.767
Have you read the articles?

456
00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:03.142
They are all praising Eun-ho!

457
00:35:04.309 --> 00:35:05.976
Yes, they are.

458
00:35:05.976 --> 00:35:07.642
If he just continues like this,

459
00:35:07.642 --> 00:35:09.059
he'll be a national for sure!

460
00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:11.726
He'll get that gold medal, no problem!

461
00:35:11.726 --> 00:35:13.267
You are the legend of short track skating!

462
00:35:13.267 --> 00:35:16.434
And your successor will be Eun-ho!

463
00:35:16.726 --> 00:35:18.726
Man-bok got injured while competing.

464
00:35:18.767 --> 00:35:20.392
I see you aren't even worried about him.

465
00:35:20.392 --> 00:35:23.601
Injuries like that do happen.

466
00:35:30.018 --> 00:35:31.809
You wouldn't try to eliminate Ho-young

467
00:35:31.809 --> 00:35:33.267
by using Man-bok, would you?

468
00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:35.018
Huh?

469
00:35:35.726 --> 00:35:37.018
How can you say that?

470
00:35:37.392 --> 00:35:39.809
He was speeding too aggressively.

471
00:35:39.809 --> 00:35:41.517
I never taught him anything like that.

472
00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:43.099
There were cameras out there!

473
00:35:43.392 --> 00:35:45.601
Maybe he wanted to show off!

474
00:35:46.183 --> 00:35:48.059
If someone at the Kangbaek Foundation

475
00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:49.851
tried to use one athlete
for the benefit of another,

476
00:35:49.892 --> 00:35:51.099
and planned something like this…

477
00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.059
If someone tried to
ruin one of our athletes like that,

478
00:35:54.392 --> 00:35:56.099
then I can no longer stay here.

479
00:35:57.099 --> 00:35:58.267
To me, Eun-ho is just as important

480
00:35:58.267 --> 00:36:00.851
as Ho-young and Man-bok.
They are all my precious pupils.

481
00:36:01.475 --> 00:36:02.434
Do you understand?

482
00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.099
You crazy bastard!

483
00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:11.018
You could have broken your ankle!

484
00:36:11.642 --> 00:36:14.684
Why did you do that?

485
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:17.475
Spit it out! Why did you do that?

486
00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:22.976
Was I that good?
You wanted to beat me that badly?

487
00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:24.183
It's nothing like that.

488
00:36:24.183 --> 00:36:27.099
So what was that dangerous speeding about?

489
00:36:29.434 --> 00:36:30.183
Hey, Ho-young…

490
00:36:32.767 --> 00:36:34.225
Can we just go back to Gangwon-do

491
00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:35.726
and skate like we used to?

492
00:36:37.934 --> 00:36:39.434
What are you talking about now?

493
00:36:39.934 --> 00:36:42.684
The Kangbaek Foundation
doesn't want you to beat Eun-ho.

494
00:36:42.684 --> 00:36:48.225
Because you are his pacesetter…

495
00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:53.684
They want Eun-ho to
compete at the Olympics.

496
00:36:53.684 --> 00:36:58.142
They're using you
so that he can win the gold.

497
00:36:59.601 --> 00:37:00.475
So what?

498
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:05.601
I tried to separate you from Eun-ho.

499
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.099
That's…

500
00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:14.099
That's what I did…

501
00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:16.225
I'm sorry, Ho-young…

502
00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:20.183
Who gave you that order?

503
00:37:23.809 --> 00:37:25.099
Who? Why?

504
00:37:25.851 --> 00:37:31.809
Mom is… in debt…

505
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.225
They said they'd take care of it…

506
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:38.183
That's why I sold you out…

507
00:37:39.642 --> 00:37:40.976
I'm really sorry.

508
00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.642
I'm so sorry, Ho-young…

509
00:37:44.642 --> 00:37:46.642
Is that why you asked me…

510
00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:50.099
to lose on purpose?

511
00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:54.309
And when that didn't go as planned,

512
00:37:54.601 --> 00:37:56.142
you threw yourself out of the race?

513
00:37:56.434 --> 00:37:58.392
I couldn't do anything to you…

514
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:03.142
Well, you did it.

515
00:38:05.726 --> 00:38:07.726
I gave up that race!

516
00:38:09.684 --> 00:38:11.018
Everything went as planned, right?

517
00:38:17.767 --> 00:38:18.183
Mom, what is it?

518
00:38:18.225 --> 00:38:20.142
Man-bok! Oh, what do we do?

519
00:38:20.142 --> 00:38:22.059
The restaurant!

520
00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:23.601
Mom… Mom, what is it?

521
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:25.018
- What is it?
- Man-bok?

522
00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:26.183
Can you come here right now?

523
00:38:26.183 --> 00:38:28.183
What is it? What's going on?

524
00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:32.517
Some men showed up at the restaurant,

525
00:38:32.517 --> 00:38:34.267
and just started wrecking the place!
I have to go!

526
00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:40.183
Not in this condition!
I'll go!

527
00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:41.851
Ho-young!

528
00:38:42.809 --> 00:38:45.267
I'm sorry…
Don't tell mom about this…

529
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:47.559
But just look at yourself!

530
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:53.225
Okay…

531
00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:30.809
Is this what you wanted?

532
00:39:32.099 --> 00:39:33.183
Thanks to you,

533
00:39:34.018 --> 00:39:35.976
I'm a shameless laughing stock now!

534
00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:38.225
What are you talking about?

535
00:39:40.434 --> 00:39:42.099
Is winning that important?

536
00:39:42.976 --> 00:39:45.809
You don't care about anything else?
As long as I win?

537
00:39:46.142 --> 00:39:48.392
Just take it easy! What happened?

538
00:39:48.392 --> 00:39:50.099
They must have reported back to you!

539
00:39:51.976 --> 00:39:53.851
You put another athlete's life on the line

540
00:39:53.851 --> 00:39:55.392
just to let me win. What good is that?

541
00:39:56.099 --> 00:39:59.851
Is this the sportsmanship
you always talk about?

542
00:39:59.892 --> 00:40:00.559
Is that it?

543
00:40:00.601 --> 00:40:02.350
What in the world is going on?

544
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.350
Don't play dumb! I heard everything!

545
00:40:05.976 --> 00:40:07.976
Doesn't matter how important my victory is.

546
00:40:08.684 --> 00:40:09.517
How could you…

547
00:40:11.434 --> 00:40:13.309
How could you rig a competition like that?

548
00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:16.434
How could you pay someone
to do something so reckelss?

549
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:19.767
What? Rigged?

550
00:40:19.767 --> 00:40:22.099
You ordered the manager, didn't you?

551
00:40:22.517 --> 00:40:23.684
That manager…

552
00:40:23.726 --> 00:40:26.100
He wouldn't do something like this
on his own.

553
00:40:27.767 --> 00:40:28.892
You used bribe…

554
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.559
and told him to eliminate Ho-young!

555
00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:36.642
I can't skate like this!

556
00:40:38.892 --> 00:40:42.183
This is too much for my pride.

557
00:40:42.183 --> 00:40:43.517
I can't do this.

558
00:40:47.642 --> 00:40:49.809
Eun-ho! Eun-ho!

559
00:41:14.767 --> 00:41:15.475
Park Eun-ho!

560
00:41:15.517 --> 00:41:18.350
What do you mean, you quit?

561
00:41:20.099 --> 00:41:21.392
Just come here. Let's talk about this.

562
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.350
Eun-ho! Eun-ho!

563
00:41:32.018 --> 00:41:33.684
What happened?

564
00:41:33.934 --> 00:41:36.018
One of our athletes got injured
in the friendly match.

565
00:41:36.018 --> 00:41:37.642
He was speeding recklessly.

566
00:41:40.475 --> 00:41:42.267
How is his condition?

567
00:41:43.099 --> 00:41:44.684
He'll need rehabilitation.

568
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.018
Sir…

569
00:41:49.726 --> 00:41:51.267
Did you plan to use Ho-young
as just a pacesetter,

570
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:52.809
and then throw him away?

571
00:41:53.934 --> 00:41:56.309
When I told him to train as a pacesetter,

572
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:59.267
I wanted him to grow alongside Eun-ho.

573
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:03.099
Eun-ho improved a lot too,
training with Ho-young.

574
00:42:04.225 --> 00:42:06.767
But after what happened,
the two won't be the same…

575
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.267
What do you mean?

576
00:42:09.267 --> 00:42:12.099
Man-bok is like a brother to Ho-young.

577
00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:14.350
Ho-young wouldn't risk his friend

578
00:42:14.392 --> 00:42:15.559
just to win a competition.

579
00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:18.601
Eun-ho just told me he's quitting as well.

580
00:42:21.851 --> 00:42:23.350
As for me, if this organization
condones this kind of trickery,

581
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:27.018
then I can no longer work here.

582
00:42:28.059 --> 00:42:29.183
I'm sorry.

583
00:42:43.267 --> 00:42:45.059
What in the world
do you think you are doing?

584
00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:48.183
Come back this instant!

585
00:42:48.183 --> 00:42:49.350
What were you thinking,

586
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.059
planning something grave like that?

587
00:42:51.225 --> 00:42:53.059
What? What?

588
00:42:53.934 --> 00:42:54.892
I'm truly sorry…

589
00:42:55.142 --> 00:42:57.684
Rigging a race?
How could you?

590
00:42:58.018 --> 00:43:00.892
If that Man-bok ends up
never recovering,

591
00:43:01.018 --> 00:43:03.809
were you planning on
taking full responsibility?

592
00:43:04.726 --> 00:43:06.642
His entire career is at stake!

593
00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:08.392
Who do you think you are?

594
00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:11.601
This was all for Eun-ho…

595
00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:14.392
all for you, chairman!

596
00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.726
How was that for us?

597
00:43:17.434 --> 00:43:18.851
I… have no excuse…

598
00:43:21.392 --> 00:43:23.475
You just made a big mistake.

599
00:43:24.099 --> 00:43:26.142
You better pray that boy recovers.

600
00:43:26.517 --> 00:43:27.851
If not,

601
00:43:28.225 --> 00:43:30.142
you won't be seeing me ever again!

602
00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:42.642
How in the world did he find out?

603
00:43:43.726 --> 00:43:44.517
Darn it!

604
00:44:38.183 --> 00:44:40.183
Hey, Ji-na!

605
00:44:42.183 --> 00:44:44.434
I was just getting hungry! Nice timing!

606
00:44:44.434 --> 00:44:46.309
Mom told me to eat before coming home.

607
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.309
And I just thought of you!

608
00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:49.809
I knew you'd be practicing here.

609
00:44:51.475 --> 00:44:54.684
Have you decided what to wear
for the audition?

610
00:44:55.434 --> 00:44:56.767
You want me to help?

611
00:44:56.934 --> 00:44:57.892
Really?

612
00:45:13.851 --> 00:45:15.851
Ho-young… Why are you here?

613
00:45:19.059 --> 00:45:21.099
Man-bok is having
a quick meeting with the coach.

614
00:45:21.099 --> 00:45:22.475
So I came in his place.

615
00:45:22.851 --> 00:45:25.267
You didn't have to come…

616
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:27.934
You didn't have to see all this…

617
00:45:30.183 --> 00:45:31.601
Hey, broken glass! That's dangerous!

618
00:45:32.183 --> 00:45:34.018
Just get some rest.
I'll do the cleaning.

619
00:45:39.809 --> 00:45:40.767
Ho-young…

620
00:45:41.642 --> 00:45:46.099
You know how much Man-bok worries about me.

621
00:45:47.726 --> 00:45:48.892
Of course.

622
00:45:51.392 --> 00:45:55.059
So don't tell him about this.

623
00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:59.142
Tell him it wasn't a big deal.

624
00:45:59.183 --> 00:46:01.100
He needs to focus on his training.

625
00:46:03.642 --> 00:46:04.475
Okay.

626
00:46:06.059 --> 00:46:09.183
It's good to have you here, though.

627
00:46:09.392 --> 00:46:13.684
Because you are always with Man-bok,

628
00:46:14.267 --> 00:46:16.559
I don't have to worry about him.

629
00:46:17.142 --> 00:46:20.851
But you know how he gets all worried…

630
00:46:21.517 --> 00:46:24.018
So just tell him it was nothing.

631
00:46:25.018 --> 00:46:28.225
Gosh, what a mess!

632
00:46:29.142 --> 00:46:30.434
I should start cleaning.

633
00:46:30.767 --> 00:46:33.267
Hey, I got this.

634
00:46:33.267 --> 00:46:34.475
You go do your thing.

635
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.559
Go on!

636
00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:37.892
No, it's okay. I'll just help out a little!

637
00:46:37.892 --> 00:46:39.267
No, just go.

638
00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:42.059
I should make you something

639
00:46:42.059 --> 00:46:43.559
to take home with you.

640
00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:46.309
But I'm just so disorganized right now.

641
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.392
Okay? Just go.

642
00:47:23.267 --> 00:47:24.434
Kang Baek-ho…

643
00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:28.475
I'm so embarrassed.

644
00:47:29.684 --> 00:47:31.684
I don't think I can face you right now.

645
00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:36.183
Fairness and sportsmanship…

646
00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:39.559
To uphold those values…

647
00:47:40.517 --> 00:47:42.934
That's why I founded this organization
and named it after you.

648
00:48:51.399 --> 00:48:53.522
<b><Short></b>

649
00:48:54.099 --> 00:48:54.684
<i>I'm so sorry…</i>

650
00:48:55.225 --> 00:48:57.183
<i>Who did this to my baby!</i>

651
00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:58.559
<i>Is Man-bok hurt?</i>

652
00:48:58.601 --> 00:48:59.350
<i>What happened?</i>

653
00:48:59.684 --> 00:49:01.684
<i>Without Man-bok, this means nothing to me.</i>

654
00:49:02.475 --> 00:49:03.267
<i>I won't do it alone.</i>

655
00:49:03.517 --> 00:49:06.517
<i>Your father's name is Kang Baek-ho, right?</i>

656
00:49:06.726 --> 00:49:09.684
<i>You know the qualification match is
coming up soon.</i>

657
00:49:09.892 --> 00:49:11.601
<i>Giving up on such fine athletes</i>

658
00:49:11.976 --> 00:49:13.309
<i>is not what you want, either.</i>

659
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:15.018
<i>The boys still haven't returned.</i>

660
00:49:15.059 --> 00:49:17.225
<i>I'm going to do my best at the audition,</i>

661
00:49:17.267 --> 00:49:18.517

<i>Ji-na, if I make it into the national team,</i>

663
00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:24.517
<i>will you go out with me?</i>

664
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:26.517
<i>I still haven't told her yet.</i>

665
00:49:26.517 --> 00:49:27.934
<i>You are too late, kid.</i>
