00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.950
(A dog mask?)

8
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.289
(They're on a dog palanquin because
it's the year of the golden dog.)

a little embarrassing.)

(DJ G.Park and DJ Charles are in

(Oh, my.)

28

of the cheerful party,)

(let us introduce the events of the
Idol Star Athletics Championships.)

42

(Bowling is newly introduced
in 2018.)

65
00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.589
I've been doing this the longest,
and I received the grand award.

66
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:26.690
I'm Jun Hyun Moo. Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.760
How could he say that about himself?

68
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.799
He's being obnoxious starting
from the first day of the new year.

69
00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm Lee Teuk,

the eldest brother to idol singers.

(Excited)

78

(It's hard to tell whether this is
a gymnasium or a club.)

79
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.829
We will start the Idol Star
Athletics Championships.

80

(We will start the Idol Star
Athletics Championships.)

81
00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:14.739
(It seems that they won't end this
before someone ends it for them.)

82
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.570
(Let's stop.)

83
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.910
(They end the
performance with a cool attitude.)

84

(2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special)

85
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.349
The athletes' oath.

86
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.950
- I pledge that...
- I pledge that...

87
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.349
All of the athletes that will
participate in track and field,

88
00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.250
bowling, archery, rhythmic
gymnastics, and aerobics...

89
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.360
for the 2018 Idol Star Athletics

will obey the following rules.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.389
We will respect the decision of the
referees and our opponents.

We will do
our best in every event,

94
00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.500
thinking that we will make
the best scene in our life.

95
00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.139
We will never forget that our fans
and the viewers are always watching.

96
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.010
We will sincerely participate
in every event.

97
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.779
Regardless our career,
experience, and beauty,

98
00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.349
we will do
our best as equal athletes.

99
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.180
We are the representative
of the athletes. I am Irene.

100

- I am S.coups.
- I am Ji Hyo.

101
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.750
I am Shownu.

102
00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.250
(They are joined
with the leaders of each team.)

103
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.719
- Return to ready.
- That was...

104
00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.329
- the leaders of each team.
- The leaders of each team.

105
00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:11.860
Yes, they took an oath together.

106
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.060
The idol stars will compete fairly
with the fans and the viewers...

107
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.729
during the 2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special.

108
00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.969
We will start the games now.

109
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.769
(The games will start right now.)

110
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.039
It's the 2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special.

111
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.649
Track and field, bowling, archery,
rhythmic gymnastics,

112
00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.310
and aerobics will be held. This is
the 60m race for track and field.

113
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.889
On the holidays, I see this person
more frequently than my parents.

114
00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.990
He's the current track and field
commentator for MBC.

115
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.690
It's Yoon Yeo Chun.
Nice to meet you.

116
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.959
- Welcome.
- Yes.

117
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.529
Mr. Yoon is...

118
00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.700
very famous among idol singers.

119
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.860
- He is famous.
- Yes.

120
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.130
- Am I that famous?
- Yes, you're very famous.

121
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.529
Like Pele's curse,

122
00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.139
there is something called
Yoon Yeo Chun's curse.

123
00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.469
If he mentions someone,

124
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.339
that person will fail quickly.

125
00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.380
- That would happen.
- Yes.

126
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.579
There's another victim here.

127
00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:05.079
- That's me.
- She was his biggest victim.

128
00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:07.579
Apink received gold...

129
00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:10.219
- about 3 times for the 400m relay.
- That's right.

130
00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:12.349
- We're that good.
- Yes.

131
00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.820
But the moment
Mr. Yoon cheered for us,

132
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.889
- we ran past the lane.
- Oh, my.

133
00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:19.459
We were eliminated.

134
00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.529
(He was confident
of Apink's victory in 2015.)

135
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.070
(But)

136
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.269
(Apink ran past the lane
like they were hypnotized.)

137
00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:31.740
They're not allowed to do that.

138
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.440
Apink is disqualified
because they made a mistake.

139
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.579
- He makes unlucky guesses.
- That's right.

140
00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:41.180
A lot of new athletes
will run today.

141
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.349
- That's right.
- We only have data of them.

142
00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.089
They never competed
against anyone.

143
00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:48.889
No one knows whether there will be
a change of generations.

144
00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.490
I'm curious.
Who are the past winners?

145
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.200
Rui from H.U.B who ran
in the women's 60m race...

146
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.070
and Woo Sung from Snuper who
ran in the men's 60m race...

147
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.500
gained attention for their records.

148
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.370
- Yes, both will be joining again.
- Right.

149
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.940
It will be interesting to see
if they will continue to get ahead.

150
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.010
Right. Women's 60m
will start now.

151
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.320
Shortly, Women's 60m Final
will begin.

152
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.750
Athletes, please enter the arena.

153
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.149
(Jeong Ye In, Yuseol, J-Sun,)

154
00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:20.889
(Rui, Yu Ju, Min Seo)

155
00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:27.159
(In the Women's 60m
Preliminary Match...)

156
00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:28.399
She has the highest
chance of winning.

157
00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.899
The first lane athlete
is outrunning everyone.

158
00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:31.670
(J-Sun emerged as a dark horse.)

159
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.700
(Yuseol beat Yu Ju
by a narrow margin.)

160
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.110
She's getting caught up. Yu Ju.

161
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.539
(Rui outrun everyone
by a big margin.)

162
00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.010
- She's very fast.
- She's fast. She's like Usain Bolt.

163
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.310
(Ye In, Yuseol, J-Sun, and Rui...)

164
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.050
(got the 1st place
from their group...)

165
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.880
(and made it to the final.)

166
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.849
She came in.

167
00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:52.019
Nobody is as good as Rui.

168
00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.360
This is Women's 60m Final.

169
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.260
Gold, silver, and bronze
medalists will be decided.

170
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.389
That's right.

171
00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:01.229
It's an irony of fate.
Rui and Yu Ju are...

172
00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:02.899
- standing side by side.
- They're in 4th and 5th lanes.

173
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:07.000
- It's going to be intense.
- It will be intense.

174
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.570
Will Yu Ju be able to win?

175
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.180
When you have a competitor,
your record improves.

176
00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:16.750
Will she be the first female idol...

177
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.050
to break into
the eight-second range?

178
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.779
It will be interesting to see.

179
00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:23.519
Whoever wins, I hope someone
will break a record.

180
00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:27.219
Hello. I am Jooe of Momoland.
I will be presenting...

181
00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:29.260
Women's 60m Final.

182
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.229
Yu Ju, unfortunately you lost
the gold medal last time.

183
00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:36.269
Will you be able to win
back the gold medal this time?

184
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:38.170
I am nervous,
but I am really happy...

185
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.839
to be cheered by many people
who love me while running.

186
00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:43.339
I will do my best,
regardless of the medal.

187
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.709
She's a fighter.

188
00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:48.239
(Go, Yu Ju!)

189
00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:49.879
(Screaming)

190
00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:53.280
You were last year's winner.

191
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.749
Who are you mostly worried about?

192
00:08:55.749 --> 00:08:56.790
It must be...

193
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.020
Yu Ju.

194
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.030
Whenever I watched
Idol Star Athletics Championships,

195
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.499
I admired her.

196
00:09:07.499 --> 00:09:10.900
Just being able to run alongside
her is a great honor for me.

197
00:09:11.369 --> 00:09:13.300
I am really happy.

198
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.670
Nevertheless, she will beat her.

199
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.140
I am Jooe,
reporting from the arena.

200
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.280
MBC.

201
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.849
(Laughing)

202
00:09:23.849 --> 00:09:25.579
That's hard to get it right.

203
00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:26.849
We came up with that idea
last night.

204
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:27.879
She managed to do it.

205
00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:31.450
It's rewarding. She's satisfied.

206
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.020
Now, Women's 60m Final
will begin.

207
00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:37.729
Rui in the third lane...

208
00:09:37.729 --> 00:09:41.700
and Yu Ju in the second lane are
drawing the most attention.

209
00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:45.499
J-Sun of S.I.S in the fourth lane
is joining for the first time.

210
00:09:45.499 --> 00:09:47.570
She had a good record,
so we never know.

211
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.410
Yuseol in the fifth lane
threatened Yu Ju.

212
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.009
We don't know what will happen.

213
00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:52.410
(Cheering passionately)

214
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.910
(Go, my idol!)

215
00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:57.310
- This is nerve-racking.
- Attention.

216
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.609
Will it be Rui or Yu Ju?

217
00:09:58.609 --> 00:10:01.180
The game began.
Will it be Rui or Yu Ju?

218
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.890
- Rui is outrunning.
- Rui is outrunning.

219
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.150
Yu Ju.

220
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.489
(Will it be Rui or Yu Ju?)

221
00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:08.920
(As soon as the game starts,
Rui sprints and outruns all.)

222
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.160
Yu Ju is behind her.

223
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.999
Rui is amazing.
There was no surprise.

224
00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:15.499
Nobody is as good as her.

225
00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:17.570
Rusain Bolt.

226
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.969
(Rui of H.U.B wins the gold medal.)

227
00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:20.140
She's great.

228
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.839
I am curious about her record.

229
00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:26.009
Did she break into
the eight-second range?

230
00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:29.040
- Yuseol got the 3rd place.
- The 3rd place.

231
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.009
- J-Sun won the second place.
- J-Sun.

232
00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:33.579
She beat Yu Ju.

233
00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:35.079
The six athletes...

234
00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:36.690
- started well.
- They started well.

235
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.520
When they were 20 meters in,

236
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.190
Rui started to get ahead,
and a V-shape was formed.

237
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.190
Right.

238
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.700
I am surprised that Yu Ju lost
the momentum in the middle.

239
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.900
Compared to the two times
when she won the gold medal,

240
00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:54.999
she's not in a good shape today.

241
00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:58.810
The medalists are decided.

242
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.109
We still don't know Rui's record.

243
00:11:02.109 --> 00:11:04.249
We are excited to see her record.

244
00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:05.509
The record is out.

245
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:07.249
Rui broke into
the eight-second range.

246
00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:09.020
(Rui set a new record.)

247
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.790
She became the first female idol
to enter the eight-second range.

248
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.790
She made into the eight-second range
by a very narrow margin.

249
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.320
- She broke the record.
- She did.

250
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.530
She finally
broke the nine-second range.

251
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.200
It was only by 0.01 second.

252
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.729
But she finished in 8.99 seconds.

253
00:11:21.859 --> 00:11:24.700
She's the first one to break
into the eight-second range.

254
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.270
- Let's give it up for her.
- Congratulations.

255

(2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special)

256
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.839
Men's 60m Final...

257
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.079
will start now.

258
00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:35.109
Like we mentioned earlier,

259
00:11:35.109 --> 00:11:37.550
it will be interesting to see
if we'll have a new track star...

260
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.119
or if the existing track stars
will continue to do well.

261
00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:42.719
That will be
the focus of this event.

262
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.719
(In the Men's 60m
Preliminary Match,)

263
00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:47.359
(Joo Heon aimed for the gold medal.)

264
00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:48.459
Joo Heon is fast.

265
00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:49.530
(So Rim is the track rising star.)

266
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.259
(Woo Sung's goal was to win
3 times in a row.)

267
00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:55.329
(Han Seung Woo of Victon
was in a great condition.)

Preliminary Match,)

(Han Seung Woo, Joo Heon,)

270
00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:00.339
(So Rim,)

271
00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:02.170
(and Woo Sung made it to the final.)

272
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.709
Woo Sung did as well as
we expected.

273
00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:08.680
Seung Woo won the bronze medal
on his first event.

274
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.550
Seung Woo is
in great condition right now.

275
00:12:12.579 --> 00:12:15.379
If he doesn't make a mistake
at the start,

276
00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:17.849
he will have a nip and tuck
match with Woo Sung.

277
00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:19.719
- He will have a nip and tuck match.
- Yes.

278
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.560
This is Men's 60m Final.

279
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.229
What we are most interested in is
if Woo Sung in the fourth lane...

280
00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:29.670
will win for the third time.

281
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.670
According to Mr. Yoon, it's a matter
of who's in better condition.

282
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.739
It's possible that someone
else wins this time.

283
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:36.410
- Seung Woo should be nervous.
- Yes.

284
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.339
Mr. Yoon mentioned it.
He should watch out.

285
00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:40.379
On your mark.

286
00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:43.109
Who will be
the rising track star of 2018?

287
00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:44.509
We will see.

288
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:47.249
Mr. Yoon said
Seung Woo of Victon...

289
00:12:47.249 --> 00:12:48.550
seems to be in good condition.

290
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.450
Woo Sung is
always the front-runner.

291
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.989
(Woo Sung of Snuper
is the front-runner.)

292
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.759
This is a nervous moment.

293
00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:55.790
Get set.

294
00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.329
(The third lane athlete falters.)

295
00:12:57.329 --> 00:12:58.459
He got up.

296
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.930
Mr. Yoon mentioned
Seung Woo earlier.

297
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.700
Seung Woo.

298
00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:05.400
(No!)

299
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.739
Seung Woo.

300
00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:08.400
- He nearly rolled forward.
- That's right.

301
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.869
Seung Woo had a false start.

302
00:13:10.869 --> 00:13:13.180
If another person
has a false start,

303
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.079
- that person will be disqualified.
- Right.

304
00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:16.780
- They're already warned once.
- On your mark.

305
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.849
As soon as Mr. Yoon mentioned,
he nearly rolled forward.

306
00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:22.420
- This is really scary.
- This is chilling.

307
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.550
It's like a horror special.

308
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.020
Because it's the final game,
they must be very nervous.

309
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.329
Don't get nervous. If someone has
a false start, he will be out.

310
00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:31.359
Right.

311
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.930
Get set.

312
00:13:36.369 --> 00:13:38.469
- Oh, dear.
- He did it again.

313
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:41.999
(Seung Woo has
another false start.)

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.339
Oh, no.

315
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.109
What happens now?

316
00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:48.280
Now...

317
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.979
Seung Woo of Victon
had two false starts.

318
00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:52.950
- The gun was misfired.
- The gun was misfired.

319
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.150
The gun was misfired.
Thank goodness.

320
00:13:55.579 --> 00:13:57.489
(Fortunately, Seung Woo
didn't have a false start.)

321
00:13:57.489 --> 00:13:59.390
(It was the gun.)

322
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.390
- Oh, dear.
- He did it again.

323
00:14:02.219 --> 00:14:05.229
It was the gun.
Seung Woo is fine. Thank goodness.

324
00:14:05.229 --> 00:14:07.060
- The gun was the problem.
- That would've made us sad.

325
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.729
Mr. Yoon's curse
has affected the gun too.

326
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.300
Even the gun.

327
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.070
- I...
- He's amazing.

328
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.540
I will explain something
before they start.

329
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.609
You have to start
after hearing the gunshot.

330
00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:19.640
If the athlete moves within
0.1 seconds after the gun has fired,

331
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.540
he is considered to
have false-started.

332
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.849
- You can't presume and start.
- If you start simultaneously...

333
00:14:23.849 --> 00:14:24.950
with the gunshot,
that's false-starting too.

334
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.280
You have to start
after hearing the gunshot.

335
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.259
(The extreme nervousness...)

336
00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:36.829
(engulfs their bodies.)

337
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.690
(Even the ones watching
are extremely nervous.)

338
00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:42.430
(Who will be the one...)

339
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.640
(to win the gold medal?)

340
00:14:47.869 --> 00:14:49.099
Get set.

341
00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:50.770
It began.

342
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.469
This is the final match.

343
00:14:52.469 --> 00:14:53.579
Y is fast.

344
00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:54.739
- Seung Woo is leading.
- Seung Woo.

345
00:14:54.739 --> 00:14:55.879
- Seung Woo.
- Seung Woo.

346
00:14:56.209 --> 00:14:57.209
- It began.
- It began.

347
00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:58.950
This is the final match.

348
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.579
(It's nip and tuck.)

349
00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:03.849
- Woo Sung.
- Seung Woo.

350
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.849
He fell.

351
00:15:05.849 --> 00:15:07.589
- Woo Sung.
- Seung Woo.

352
00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:09.329
He fell.

353
00:15:09.329 --> 00:15:11.089
- Seung woo fell.
- Seung woo fell.

354
00:15:11.089 --> 00:15:12.959
He fell, but...

355
00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:15.030
- We need to check the video.
- He fell while...

356
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.770
passing the finish line.

357
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.369
For the first time
in the short-distance track event,

358
00:15:19.369 --> 00:15:21.140
we will be reviewing the video.

359
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.609
Like what Mr. Yoon said,
we need to see...

360
00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:25.940
whose torso entered
the finish line first.

361
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.109
Let's check the slow video.

362
00:15:27.109 --> 00:15:29.849
- Everyone started very well.
- They were good.

363
00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:31.310
- The start was good.
- They are fast.

364
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.479
This is when Seung Woo
started getting ahead of Woo Sung.

365
00:15:35.479 --> 00:15:36.589
He's outrunning.

366
00:15:36.589 --> 00:15:38.219
- He was doing well until this time.
- This is when it happened.

367
00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:40.660
He faltered there.

368
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.890
(He faltered right before
the finish line.)

369
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.430
Even if he falls...

370
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.259
(Mr. Yoon sighs.)

371
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:49.499
Even if he falls...

372
00:15:49.499 --> 00:15:51.900
(He sighs.)

373
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:54.540
Why did you let out a sigh?

374
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.369
Why did you sigh?

375
00:15:56.369 --> 00:16:00.780
Woo Sung's torso
passed the finish line first.

376
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.349
Seung Woo ran well,
but just before...

377
00:16:03.349 --> 00:16:05.749
reaching the finish line,
he faltered.

378
00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:10.249
Did Mr. Yoon's curse
make this happen?

379
00:16:10.249 --> 00:16:11.249
His curse did it.

380
00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:13.619
It's the worst thing
that can happen.

381
00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:15.219
- How can you...
- Why did he fall?

382
00:16:15.219 --> 00:16:18.089
- He false-started once. The gun...
- Why do you make me look bad?

383
00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:19.759
misfired, and he also fell.

384
00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:22.229
He was just about to finish.

385
00:16:22.229 --> 00:16:23.629
He was cursed three times.

386
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:25.829
If one of his feet finished first,

387
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:28.270
Seung Woo would have won.

388
00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:31.469
Let's watch it. Where exactly
is the torso?

389
00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:34.209
- It's your chest.
- Your chest has to finish first.

390
00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:38.209
Woo Sung's chest finished first.

391
00:16:38.209 --> 00:16:39.619
Seung Woo fell,

392
00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:41.579
- but he was the 2nd to finish.
- He got the 2nd place.

393
00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:44.520
If Seung Woo didn't fall,
he could've won.

394
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.749
- Right.
- Right.

395
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:46.859
The record is out.

396
00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:48.690
With the record of 7.76 seconds,

397
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.329
Woo Sung of Snuper
won the gold medal.

398
00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:54.300
With 0.05 second margin,
Seung Woo of Victon...

399
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.170
- became the silver medalist.
- Yes.

400
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.469
The bronze medal went to
Joo Heon of Monsta X.

401
00:16:59.469 --> 00:17:02.140
He finished in 7.876 seconds.

402
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.709
Woo Sung of Snuper...

403
00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:06.109
won gold
for three consecutive games.

404
00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.040
This is his third win in a row.

405
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.249
I'm Jooe, and I'm with
the medalists now.

406
00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:14.479
I'd like to hear their
winning speech here first. Rui.

407
00:17:14.479 --> 00:17:16.620
My mom came to see me
from Japan today.

408
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.160
I'm glad that she could
see me win the game.

409
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:23.660
I'm glad that I won
three consecutive games.

410
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:27.059
I'll keep trying my best...

411
00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:28.830
not to disappoint you. Thank you.

412
00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:32.370
We'd like to see
your victory ceremony.

413
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.600
I'll record it for you.

414
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.580
Let me show you.

415
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.110
It looks pretty.

416
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.690
Woo Sung, we'd like you
to make a ceremony video...

417
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.729
- for your fans.
- Okay.

418
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.930
Thank you for supporting me at 2018
Idol Star Athletics Championships.

419
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.999
I'll try even harder
for the games on Chuseok.

420
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.799
I could've done all this
thanks to my fans.

421
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.569
Thank you, and I love you.
I'll see you again.

422
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.080
(The first bowling game of
Idol Star Athletics Championships)

423
00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:15.880
Find the best
idol bowler of Korea.

424
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.610
We're back again this year.

425
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.080
This is 2018 Idol Star
Athletics Championships.

426
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.049
And bowling is
newly added this year.

427
00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:25.249
I'm today's commentator, Seo In.

428
00:18:25.289 --> 00:18:27.719
And we have three special guests...

429
00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:29.890
who will deliver the excitement
of today's match.

430
00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.830
First, he's the forever leader
of Infinite, Sung Kyu. Hello.

431
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.630
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Sung Kyu.

432
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:35.860
Do you like bowling?

433
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.200
- Bowling?
- Yes.

434
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.940
I like it very much.
It's my favorite sports.

435
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.640
But I haven't played it before.

436
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.209
That's a surprise.

437
00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:46.610
She wants to create
another legend with bowling.

438
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.239
She's Hani of EXID.

439
00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:49.650
(Hani of EXID)

440
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.319
Hello, this is my first time
to be here as a commentator.

441
00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:57.489
- I'm honored. I'll try my best.
- All right. And...

442
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.559
we have a bowling genius here.

443
00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:02.590
He's the member of the national team
with 14 years of experience.

444
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.690
He's the master of bowling,
Commentator Choi Bok Eum.

445
00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.459
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Bowler Choi Bok Eum.

446
00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:09.769
We will look forward to
your in-depth commentary.

447
00:19:09.769 --> 00:19:10.870
Okay.

448
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.870
- Bowling is very popular.
- That's right.

449
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.539
The best bowlers are picked to play,

450
00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:19.580
and they've been devoting themselves
to practice night and day.

451
00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:22.680
Some of them are well known
to be good at bowling,

452
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.950
and others just started bowling
for this match.

453
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.350
I heard they all are
on their sweeping upturn.

454
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.950
I can't wait to watch the game.

455
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.019
(Shortly)

456
00:19:34.459 --> 00:19:37.160
(Powerful bowling
full of masculinity)

457
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.700
(A powerful strike to smash pins)

458
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.269
(Men's bowling will be liberating.)

459
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.309
- It's possible.
- It could turn the game over.

460
00:19:49.309 --> 00:19:50.410
That's right.

461
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.880
(It's like a bowling drama
of a seesaw game.)

462
00:19:56.009 --> 00:19:57.650
(Repeated dramatic twists)

463
00:19:58.979 --> 00:20:01.350
(Women's bowling with the shocking
result will begin shortly.)

464
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.120
2018 Idol Star
Athletics Championships.

465
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.160
You must be curious about the list
of matches for Men's bowling.

466
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.489
We'll reveal it now.

467
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.299
We have the spectacular
line-up for Men's bowling.

468
00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:16.170
This is amazing.
All the idol stars are here.

469
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.670
And the fans' cheering
for the players...

470
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.739
are getting more intense.

471
00:20:20.739 --> 00:20:23.039
Let's talk
to the cheering squad first then.

472
00:20:23.209 --> 00:20:25.309
(Screaming)

473
00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:27.340
(The cheering is
more like a shriek.)

474
00:20:27.509 --> 00:20:29.850
I heard the members of
Wanna One are here.

475
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.950
- Wanna One.
- Where are you, Wanna One?

476
00:20:32.049 --> 00:20:33.219
Hello.

477
00:20:33.219 --> 00:20:34.850
- Hello.
- There they are.

478
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.450
Please say hello to our viewers.

479
00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:38.150
In 1, 2, and 3.

480
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.819
All I want to do, Wanna One.
Hello, we're Wanna One.

481
00:20:40.819 --> 00:20:42.660
It's nice to meet you.

482
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.630
Would you send a message
of support to the players?

483
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:49.700
In fact,

484
00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:52.430
I already got hoarse
from all this cheering.

485
00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:56.840
I shouted myself hoarse
cheering for them even at home.

486
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.509
Actually, I'm not worried
about my team.

487
00:20:58.509 --> 00:21:01.380
I heard they've played bowling...

488
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.080
since the moment they were born.

489
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.450
- Really?
- Yes.

490
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:07.680
- Well...
- So I'm not worried at all.

491
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.719
- I hope our team will win.
- Okay. Good luck.

492
00:21:10.819 --> 00:21:14.519
We just talked to the cheering
squads to check their excitement.

493
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.259
2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special.

494
00:21:17.259 --> 00:21:20.100
This is Men's Bowling
Preliminary Match.

495
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.430
It begins now.

496
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.529
(2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special)

497
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.940
It's MONSTA X versus Seventeen.

498
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.769
The first match of Men's Bowling
Preliminary Match, Group One.

499
00:21:31.809 --> 00:21:33.080
The players are coming in.

500
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.080
They are the monsters
who dominate the K-Pop scene,

501
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.610
Joo Heon and Min Hyuk
of MONSTA X.

502
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.809
They look cool.

503
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.819
They are talented idol stars
who are good at singing and dancing.

504
00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.289
Seung Kwan and Min Gyu of Seventeen.

505
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:47.660
- They are very funny.
- They're humorous.

506
00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:49.529
What was that?

507
00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:55.259
(MONSTA X versus Seventeen)

508
00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:56.600
This is Idol Star
Athletics Championships.

509
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.900
So we have our own rules
and formats for the game.

510
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.009
Commentator Choi Bok Eum with
a fair skin will explain the rules.

511
00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:05.009
The game will be
based on the Scotch Game...

512
00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:09.979
where two players take turns
to throw a bowling ball.

513
00:22:09.979 --> 00:22:12.410
From Frame 1 to 5,

514
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.479
Player A bowls first,
and Player B picks up a spare.

515
00:22:15.479 --> 00:22:17.489
From Frame 6 to 10,

516
00:22:17.749 --> 00:22:19.559
Player B bowls first.

517
00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:21.459
- They change the order?
- They play in the reverse order.

518
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.029
Idol Star Bowling Championships.

519
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:26.729
Let's begin the first match.

520
00:22:26.729 --> 00:22:27.959
Min Gyu of Seventeen...

521
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.069
goes first.

522
00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:33.400
Min Gyu will throw the ball.

523
00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:34.739
They made an interesting promise...

524
00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:35.799
- for their victory.
- What's that?

525
00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:38.539
If they win, they will disguise
as bowling pins in front of MBC.

526
00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:39.880
I really want to see that.

527
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.180
At this moment...

528
00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:44.910
(Where did the ball go?)

529
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.580
He's left-handed.

530
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:49.950
(Seventeen versus MONSTA X)

531
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.420
I've never seen
such a powerful gutter before.

532
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.120
(Gutter is when the ball goes into
the gutter without touching pins.)

533
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.190
MONSTA X seems very excited.

534
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.299
They are celebrating it by
patting each other on the back.

535
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.830
They have a chance
to pick up a spare.

536
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.529
- That's right.
- They could pick up 10 spares.

537
00:23:05.229 --> 00:23:07.739
- Seung Kwan doesn't look happy.
- It's okay.

538
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.469
He said his opponent is Min Gyu
from his team.

539
00:23:10.469 --> 00:23:12.170
He did? Is it an internal conflict?

540
00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:15.809
All right. He threw
the ball powerfully.

541
00:23:16.049 --> 00:23:17.150
Good!

542
00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:18.610
(8 pins)

543
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.979
He scored eight points.

544
00:23:20.719 --> 00:23:21.950
That was nice.

545
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.890
Seventeen knocked down eight pins.

546
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.059
It's MONSTA X's turn now.

547
00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:31.229
Here comes Min Hyuk.

548
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.700
You are handsome.

549
00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:36.700
There goes Min Hyuk.

550
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.529
- That was gentle.
- It looks good.

551
00:23:38.529 --> 00:23:39.700
It's gentle.

552
00:23:41.069 --> 00:23:42.670
What was that?

553
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.969
It's gentle.

554
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.940
(A pin knocked down another one.)

555
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.140
(Seventeen versus MONSTA X)

556
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.249
The last pin was hidden in there.

557
00:23:52.249 --> 00:23:54.380
Is Joo Heon happy?

558
00:23:54.819 --> 00:23:56.549
- He's happy.
- He's not upset, isn't he?

559
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:59.150
(He looked too vigorous.)

560
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.489
Would Joo Heon be able
to pick up a spare?

561
00:24:02.219 --> 00:24:05.459
The pin is not in a difficult
position to knock down.

562
00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:08.160
That's right.
He might be able to do it.

563
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.630
All right. It's all
about accuracy now.

564
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.140
(He fails to pick up a spare.)

565
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.969
It was too strong.

566
00:24:15.969 --> 00:24:18.739
But they're ahead of the game.

567
00:24:18.739 --> 00:24:19.940
(Seventeen versus MONSTA X)

568
00:24:21.239 --> 00:24:22.580
How will he throw the ball
this time?

569
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.319
It's turning to the left.
It came back in.

570
00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:29.420
That was good.

571
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.549
- The men players...
- I think they're getting warmed up.

572
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:34.489
- They're getting warmed up.
- They're getting better.

573
00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:35.759
They're getting the hang of it.

574
00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:36.789
(His lips are parched.)

575
00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:39.190
Would he pick up spares?

576
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.630
He threw the ball.

577
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.900
It's getting closer.

578
00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:46.799
It's just like their first try.

579
00:24:47.539 --> 00:24:50.309
- He looks confident.
- It was a little too soon.

580
00:24:50.309 --> 00:24:52.410
- It was too soon.
- The release was too soon.

581
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.610
- It was very close.
- It almost fell in the gutter.

582
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.450
- That was so close.
- It's like a perilla leaf.

583
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.219
- It's like a perilla leaf.
- How many leaves would that be?

584
00:25:01.219 --> 00:25:02.819
It's like one and a half leaf close.

585
00:25:03.219 --> 00:25:06.219
Or in this case,
it's one hairy leaf.

586
00:25:06.519 --> 00:25:08.160
All right. This is Frame Two.

587
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.330
He's Min Hyuk of MONSTA X.

588
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.489
(Min Hyuk of MONSTA X
looks serious getting ready.)

589
00:25:13.229 --> 00:25:14.459
He looks intrepid.

590
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.700
- He threw the ball boldly.
- It looks good.

591
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.729
Good. It's in the center.

592
00:25:17.729 --> 00:25:19.130
It's a strike!

593
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.039
(The first strike)

594
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.809
That's the first strike
of this game.

595
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.350
Min Hyuk of MONSTA X bowled
the first strike.

596
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.880
They do the ceremony like monsters.

597
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.719
It was amazing.

598
00:25:35.989 --> 00:25:38.650
He looks nimble bowling the strike.

599
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.420
I agree. It sounded light.

600
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.519
(It looks like the ball would
bound from the rail.)

601
00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:43.660
The spin was good.

602
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.259
It went right between pin 1 and 3.

603
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.239
Seventeen would also need a strike.

604
00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:56.239
- He might feel a little pressured.
- Right.

605
00:25:56.239 --> 00:25:59.640
(Would they be able to catch up?)

606
00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:04.080
Min Gyu of Seventeen.

607
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.680
It's his third try.

608
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.319
It's good.

609
00:26:10.219 --> 00:26:12.150
(9 pins)

610
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.890
(Seventeen versus MONSTA X)

611
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:16.259
(That was so close.)

612
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.100
(Forget about the previous plays.)

613
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.069
(Their teamwork is back.)

614
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.039
(On the other hand, MONSTA X
struggles to pick up a spare.)

615
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.569
It's going close.

616
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.249
(They don't have luck
on their side.)

617
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.880
(Seung Kwan of Seventeen
never passes up the chance.)

618
00:26:42.719 --> 00:26:43.749
It's good.

619
00:26:43.749 --> 00:26:45.920
(He keeps knocking down 9 pins.)

620
00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.319
(It's the curse of 1 pin.)

621
00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:49.690
There's a pin left again.

622
00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.430
(Seung Kwan of Seventeen
is the prince of 9 pins.)

623
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.299
He failed to pick up a spare.

624
00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:54.759
(Seventeen versus MONSTA X)

625
00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:57.029
Seventeen has scored 104 points.

626
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.529
It's MONSTA X's turn.

627
00:26:58.529 --> 00:27:01.739
(MONSTA X has
just a few chances left.)

628
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.140
(They cannot relax yet.)

629
00:27:05.469 --> 00:27:07.580
(Glaring)

630
00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:11.350
(Joo Heon of MONSTA X
is being more careful than ever.)

631
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.719
There he goes.

632
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.650
He throws the ball
with all his might.

633
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.319
Strike!

634
00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:22.519
(He finally bowls a strike.)

635
00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:25.430
He bowls a strike at last.
Joo Heon's play is amazing.

636
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.029
(Seventeen versus Monsta X)

637
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:28.400
Yes, he's incredible.

638
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.900
(Joo Heon,
you really did a good job.)

639
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.400
He was great.

640
00:27:32.499 --> 00:27:35.299
He suddenly bowled a strike.

641
00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:38.269
The atmosphere has changed now.

642
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.940
They are so happy.

643
00:27:41.209 --> 00:27:42.749
Take it easy, Seung Kwan!

644
00:27:42.749 --> 00:27:44.410
It was MONSTA X's second strike.

645
00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.549
Now we cannot predict the result.

646
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:47.749
That's true.

647
00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:49.989
The ball is moving
in the right direction this time.

648
00:27:49.989 --> 00:27:52.049
It hits the bowling pins
just right.

649
00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:53.920
It moved in a clean strike course.

650
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.860
He succeeded in bowling
a very clean strike.

651
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:59.660
Seung Kwan should feel
rather burdensome.

652
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.729
Right.

653
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:05.930
(This is his last frame.)

654
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.739
It's about time he bowls a strike.

655
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.670
He has played the game
in a pretty similar way all along.

656
00:28:11.709 --> 00:28:13.779
Now, it's his last frame.

657
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.979
Seung Kwan has kept missing
one pin so far.

658
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.380
Can he bowl a strike this time?

659
00:28:24.249 --> 00:28:25.249
Strike! No!

660
00:28:25.249 --> 00:28:28.620
- He missed one again.
- He didn't hit one again.

661
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.660
I really feel sorry.

662
00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:32.900
That's fine, though.

663
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.130
There's Min Gyu who's left-handed.

664
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:40.640
The bowling pin is located where
it's advantageous for Min Gyu.

665
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.870
That location is more advantageous
for a left-handed player for sure.

666
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.239
The ball moves in a direction
which the hand rotates,

667
00:28:47.239 --> 00:28:49.039
and that's where the bowling pin
is located.

668
00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:52.549
Therefore, now it's easier
to bowl a strike.

669
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:59.989
- Is it going to hit now?
- He did it!

670
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.160
(He perfectly took care of it.)

671
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.930
Seung Kwan missed one bowling pin,

672
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.200
and Min Gyu took care of it.

673
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.469
- It was amazing.
- That's awesome.

674
00:29:10.469 --> 00:29:12.799
They have a great teamwork.
Don't you think so, Sung Kyu?

675
00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:14.039
- That's very nice.
- Isn't it?

676
00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:17.670
They have a good combination.
It looks like Min Gyu can predict...

677
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.940
what's going to happen.
He's going a great job.

678
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.140
That's nice.

679
00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:25.450
If team members can lead and pull
one another like that,

680
00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.549
it would be nice whatever they do.

681
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:28.650
(Seventeen's teamwork shines
in the moment of crisis.)

682
00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:31.590
- Now, Min Hyuk...
- Let's go!

683
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.489
of MONSTA X is throwing the ball.

684
00:29:38.229 --> 00:29:40.229
He swings with confidence.

685
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.959
Is it going all right?

686
00:29:41.959 --> 00:29:43.170
Strike!

687
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.900
He swings with confidence.

688
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.140
Is it going all right?

689
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.739
(It's a double strike.)

690
00:29:47.739 --> 00:29:48.769
Are they checking the video?

691
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:50.440
It was the first double strike,
right?

692
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.870
Yes, it was the first double strike.

693
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.479
- It's the first double strike.
- A double strike.

694
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.840
He's incredible.

695
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.610
Now he can get a lot of points.

696
00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.519
- We really cannot predict anymore.
- We cannot.

697
00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:03.950
- He's getting at least 30 points.
- Right.

698
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.190
- Now it's the 10th frame.
- It's the 10th frame now.

699
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.489
They will have a bonus frame.

700
00:30:10.489 --> 00:30:13.100
Ace players of each team will play.

701
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.330
Still, MONSTA X seems to be
more advantageous.

702
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.499
Right. All the frames are over now.

703
00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:22.299
It's 118 versus 114.

704
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.739
MONSTA X is leading with
a few more points,

705
00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:27.940
but both teams still have
a bonus frame left.

706
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.150
So we cannot be sure
about the result.

707
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.950
An ace player can bowl...

708
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.120
for the bonus frame.

709
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.450
Who's going to play?

710
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.259
For MONSTA X,

711
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.390
- Min Hyuk is playing.
- Min Hyuk.

712
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.130
- Min Hyuk is going first.
- Let's go!

713
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.330
(The last frame will decide
the result.)

714
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.469
(What score will Min Hyuk of
MONSTA X get for the bonus frame?)

715
00:30:53.499 --> 00:30:55.600
- He bowls confidently.
- That's nice.

716
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.640
- He bowls confidently.
- That's nice.

717
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.279
It's good.

718
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.039
(He made it.)

719
00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:04.779
- What's that? It's a turkey!
- A turkey!

720
00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:06.150
He got a turkey.

721
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.789
(A turkey means bowling
three strikes in a row.)

722
00:31:11.749 --> 00:31:12.819
I can't believe this.

723
00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:15.660
A turkey is made in the first game.

724
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.289
He got a turkey.

725
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.660
Is that possible?

726
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.959
(He's shaking his head.)

727
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.930
Min Hyuk is amazing.

728
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.670
(Seventeen versus MONSTA X)

729
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:29.610
Let's see the replay.

730
00:31:29.769 --> 00:31:31.440
That's unbelievable.

731
00:31:32.069 --> 00:31:34.779
MONSTA X's score is now 138.

732
00:31:35.709 --> 00:31:37.150
The ball hit pin 1 and pin 3.

733
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.110
- It was a perfect strike.
- Right.

734
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.319
He has one more chance left.

735
00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.890
There's one more chance.

736
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.819
Can he go beyond a turkey...

737
00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:49.590
and get a four bagger?

738
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.090
(He's trying to get a 4 bagger,
which is 4 strikes in a row.)

739
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.700
I think he might get a four bagger.

740
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.729
Right.

741
00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.330
It's rare to see it.

742
00:31:56.469 --> 00:31:59.229
- Right.
- It's hard to see a four bagger.

743
00:31:59.229 --> 00:32:01.239
You can see it
mostly in professional games.

744
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.969
Can he make it?

745
00:32:05.769 --> 00:32:07.039
(9 pins)

746
00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:08.910
There's one pin left.

747
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.410
- There's one left.
- The ball went all right.

748
00:32:11.709 --> 00:32:14.319
In the last trial,

749
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.319
he got nine points.

750
00:32:16.319 --> 00:32:19.860
MONSTA X finishes the game
with a total score of 147.

751
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.390
They're amazing.

752
00:32:22.729 --> 00:32:24.590
(He's composing his mind.)

753
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:26.630
How can he play so well?

754
00:32:26.999 --> 00:32:30.569
Let's see how this game turns out.

755
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.969
I think Seung Kwan should play
like he's practicing now.

756
00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:37.809
Yes. His competitor played so well
at the end.

757
00:32:37.809 --> 00:32:40.309
(9 points prince challenges
for a strike again.)

758
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:44.650
He bowls with confidence.

759
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:47.080
Is it a strike?

760
00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.680
He didn't get one.

761
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.450
He could have bowled a strike once.

762
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.860
It was Seung Kwan.

763
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.660
He left one pin again at the end.

764
00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.190
There's one pin left.

765
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.660
I feel very sorry.

766
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.130
The game is over now.

767
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.700
It's 147 versus 123.
MONSTA X won the game.

768
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.870
Congratulations!

Tell me the story later.

789
00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:58.819
He said, "The victory is ours
for sure."

790
00:33:58.819 --> 00:34:00.489
He's full of confidence.

791
00:34:00.489 --> 00:34:02.259
He showed such confidence.

792
00:34:02.259 --> 00:34:03.529
- Commentator Choi.
- Yes.

793
00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:06.259
Yang Yo Seop of Highlight...

794
00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:08.160
is known to be very competent in
playing bowling among entertainers.

795
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.799
Right. He is.

796
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:13.870
(Yo Seop of Highlight enjoys
bowling during his free time.)

797
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:20.640
(He made time to practice
despite his busy schedule.)

798
00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:28.319
It's true that Yo Seop is good
at bowling as they say.

799
00:34:28.319 --> 00:34:29.649
He's a skilled player.

800
00:34:29.649 --> 00:34:33.960
However, we cannot be sure
that Highlight is going to win.

801
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.629
It depends on how much Jun Hyung
supports Yo Seop.

802
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:39.259
I think that can play a big part.

803
00:34:39.259 --> 00:34:43.299
Right. If Yo Seop had said
"The victory is ours",

804
00:34:43.299 --> 00:34:44.969
I would have agreed with him.

805
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:49.640
However, Jun Hyung, who should
support Yo Seop a lot,

806
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.270
told me with such confidence...

807
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:54.609
to watch the game carefully.

808
00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:57.410
Jun Hyung wrote that his rival...

809
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.109
is himself.

810
00:34:59.109 --> 00:35:01.419
- Did he?
- He's full of confidence now.

811
00:35:01.419 --> 00:35:03.620
When asked to write down his rival,
Yo Seop also answered...

812
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.620
- that it's himself.
- He did?

813
00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.520
They should change their team name
to "Overcoming Oneself".

814
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.560
It's incredible.

815
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.899
I wonder whether it's vanity
or confidence.

816
00:35:12.899 --> 00:35:15.759
I think Yo Seop is confident,

817
00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:18.100
but as I see it, how Jun Hyung plays
would matter.

818
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.100
- Is it confidence out of nowhere?
- Please go back to your seat.

819
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.810
I'm sorry. I apologize.

820
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.569
- I'm sorry.
- I think it will be a great match.

821
00:35:25.569 --> 00:35:28.710
It's a match between seniors and
juniors who are close to each other.

822
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.819
Can KNK overcome Highlight,
the most promising contender?

823
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.680
Jeong In Seong also wrote
that his rival is himself.

824
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.189
He did?

825
00:35:37.319 --> 00:35:40.060
He's really a successful fan.

826
00:35:40.219 --> 00:35:42.489
- He hit seven pins.
- That's a good start.

827
00:35:42.489 --> 00:35:44.129
- He began nicely.
- Yes, that's fine.

828
00:35:44.129 --> 00:35:45.629
- He got six pins.
- He got six?

829
00:35:45.629 --> 00:35:48.060
There's one more left.
He got six pins.

830
00:35:48.259 --> 00:35:49.770
It's Oh Hee Jun.

831
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.069
(Hee Jun of KNK bowls
to pick up the spares.)

832
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.500
There he goes.

833
00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.969
(He fails to pick up the spares.)

834
00:35:56.969 --> 00:35:58.509
Even though he didn't pick up
the spares,

835
00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:01.080
they encourage each other.

836
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.250
Finally, Yo Seop is playing now.

837
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.379
At last, we can see his skills.

838
00:36:07.649 --> 00:36:10.719
(Yo Seop throws the ball.)

839
00:36:10.719 --> 00:36:12.759
Here goes Yo Seop.

840
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.529
It's good.

841
00:36:16.529 --> 00:36:17.689
(It's a strike at the first throw.)

842
00:36:17.689 --> 00:36:18.859
There he goes.

843
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.230
It's good.

844
00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:25.069
- There he goes.
- A strike.

845
00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:26.939
He's getting the start
on his opponents.

846
00:36:26.939 --> 00:36:29.169
He plays well as they say.

847
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.469
It's daunting for the other team
from the beginning.

848
00:36:31.469 --> 00:36:33.540
He's does the ceremony.

849
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.549
Yo Seop got the start
on his competitors.

850
00:36:36.609 --> 00:36:38.410
But we should know...

851
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.219
that Jun Hyung's playing next.

852
00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:43.989
It might be their strategy
to change the turn.

853
00:36:43.989 --> 00:36:46.719
- Right.
- Yo Seop will hit a strike anyway.

854
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.890
All right.

855
00:36:50.129 --> 00:36:51.259
Okay.

856
00:36:52.759 --> 00:36:54.500
They keep looking at me.

857
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.600
I see.

858
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.430
(In Seong of KNK
concentrates again.)

859
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.500
There he goes.

860
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.169
- Its' great.
- Its' great.

861
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.469
Good shot!

862
00:37:04.469 --> 00:37:06.080
(It's a strike.)

863
00:37:06.879 --> 00:37:08.339
Good shot!

864
00:37:08.339 --> 00:37:11.850
He couldn't lose.

865
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.049
- Well done.
- He did it.

866
00:37:13.049 --> 00:37:15.279
(KNK versus Highlight)

867
00:37:15.279 --> 00:37:17.649
- They counterattacked.
- They did.

868
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.219
Jun Hyung was very confident.

869
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.660
Nobody knows how talented
he really is. Let's check out.

870
00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:26.430
Let's see.

871
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.430
It's tilted slightly to the left.

872
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.899
(Oh, dear.)

873
00:37:33.669 --> 00:37:35.000
He's tilting his head.

874
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:36.669
He tilted his head.

875
00:37:37.339 --> 00:37:40.680
He's very humble.

876
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.239
(KNK versus Highlight)

877
00:37:42.879 --> 00:37:44.509
(How will Yo Seop do?)

878
00:37:44.509 --> 00:37:46.180
- Yo Seop.
- Yo Seop.

879
00:37:46.649 --> 00:37:47.819
Will he bowl a strike?

880
00:37:47.819 --> 00:37:49.689
(He fails to clear all the pins.)

881
00:37:49.689 --> 00:37:51.290
He failed to clear all the pins.

882
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:52.489
(He knocked down 5 pins.)

883
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.189
(KNK has a chance to catch up.)

884
00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:56.560
It's Hee Jun.

885
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.989
- It's good.
- Well done.

886
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.370
(One pin wobbles.)

887
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:05.529
(8 pins)

888
00:38:05.529 --> 00:38:07.439
That was one tenacious pin.

889
00:38:07.439 --> 00:38:08.969
He threw the ball well.

890
00:38:09.169 --> 00:38:12.410
If In Seong picks up a spare,

891
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.279
he will put his team
in a very advantageous position.

892
00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:17.049
Let's see.

893
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.279
It's going there.

894
00:38:23.549 --> 00:38:25.489
(They're surprised.)

895
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.290
(He picked up all the spares.)

896
00:38:32.029 --> 00:38:33.430
Finally, someone did it.

897
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.460
It's the scene I wanted to see.

898
00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.770
That's it. He finally did it.

899
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.299
- Go, In Seong!
- Go, In Seong!

900
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.500
He managed to do
something very difficult.

901
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.310
That's not easy to do.

902
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:45.140
The two pins were split apart.

903
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.980
He achieved it through a pin action.

904
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.950
What are we supposed to say
in a situation like this?

905
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.910
- "Good shot!"
- Good shot!

906
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.419
Good shot, In Seong.

907
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.919
(Good shot, In Seong.)

908
00:38:54.919 --> 00:38:56.020
Let's see.

909
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.390
(Jun Hyung fights back.)

910
00:38:57.689 --> 00:38:58.850
(His throw wasn't so good.)

911
00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.219
Is it tilting to the left?

912
00:39:02.259 --> 00:39:04.689
- He's discovering his talent.
- He is.

913
00:39:05.629 --> 00:39:06.899
How will he do?

914
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.899
It could've gone better.

915
00:39:09.669 --> 00:39:11.069
(Is Highlight in trouble?)

916
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.569
- It's tilting to the left.
- Come on.

917
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.969
He only added one point.

918
00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:25.009
Will In Seong do a good job?

919
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.680
He bowled a strike once.

920
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.049
- It's looking nice.
- It's looking nice.

921
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:32.049
(He manages to pick up a spare.)

922
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.489
(KNK versus Highlight)

923
00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:36.390
Isn't he the new dark horse?

924
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.859
In Seong is good.

925
00:39:37.859 --> 00:39:40.960
(In Seong of KNK emerges
as the dark horse.)

926
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.669
(It's Highlight's frame again.)

927
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.370
- It's not bad.
- It's good!

928
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.600
(9 pins)

929
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.009
That's it.
That's the true Jun Hyung.

930
00:39:50.009 --> 00:39:52.779
- He's starting to get it.
- He's getting the hang of it.

931
00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.379
(The dark horse
gets the hang of it.)

932
00:39:58.379 --> 00:39:59.520
(And he knocked down 9 pins.)

933
00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.919
(Jun Hyung continues to score high.)

934
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.060
- It's nice.
- It's nice.

935
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.660
(Yo Seop is sharp again!)

936
00:40:13.399 --> 00:40:14.600
(However)

937
00:40:15.029 --> 00:40:16.270
In Seong is doing quite well.

938
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.029
He picked up the spare again.

939
00:40:19.299 --> 00:40:20.370
Will he do it again?

940
00:40:22.339 --> 00:40:23.439
He threw a straight ball.

941
00:40:23.439 --> 00:40:25.739
(He continues to pick up
the spare.)

942
00:40:26.779 --> 00:40:29.279
- He's in his element.
- He is.

943
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.480
We still don't know
who is going to win.

944
00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:35.950
It's already the last frame.

945
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.290
It's Hee Jun's turn.

946
00:40:41.759 --> 00:40:43.989
Hee Jun threw a powerful ball.

947
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.200
(6 pins)

948
00:40:48.259 --> 00:40:49.259
(He's not happy.)

949
00:40:49.259 --> 00:40:50.930
It was a safe one.

950
00:40:52.529 --> 00:40:53.600
(The last bowler or KNK is...)

951
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.370
It's In Seong, who has
a lot of friends.

952
00:40:56.169 --> 00:40:57.609
- He's been doing very well today.
- Yes.

953
00:40:57.609 --> 00:40:59.439
He's doing very well today.

954
00:41:00.009 --> 00:41:02.879
Will he pick up the spare?

955
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.850
(He manages to pick up the spare.)

956
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.250
- He's a genius.
- In Seong is...

957
00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:16.359
In Seong did it.

958
00:41:16.359 --> 00:41:19.160
- Now, if...
- Yes.

959
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.899
Highlight has a turkey,

960
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.370
and KNK has a gutter ball,

961
00:41:24.799 --> 00:41:27.339
- they will have a tie.
- They will have a tie.

962
00:41:27.439 --> 00:41:30.109
It won't be easy,
but Jun Hyung will...

963
00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:31.609
- do his best.
- Let's see.

964
00:41:32.939 --> 00:41:34.509
Will he bowl a strike?

965
00:41:39.419 --> 00:41:40.950
(The game is over.)

966
00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:44.819
Yo Seop of Highlight.

967
00:41:45.049 --> 00:41:46.460
He's got a chance.

968
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.600
(He picks up the spare
and finishes the game.)

969
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.830
(He's sad.)

970
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.529
The game now has ended.

971
00:41:58.529 --> 00:42:01.339
Highlight scored 107.

972
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.669
KNK scored 124.

973
00:42:04.669 --> 00:42:06.640
And KNK won.

974
00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.410
(Astro versus Snuper)

975
00:42:10.009 --> 00:42:12.509
(Astro bowled a strike.)

976
00:42:13.779 --> 00:42:16.549
(Snuper was in bad condition.)

977
00:42:18.189 --> 00:42:21.189
Astro won.

978
00:42:21.859 --> 00:42:22.930
(2018 Idol Star
Athletics Championships)

979
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.629
Chan Yeol from
Korea's best idol group EXO.

980
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.600
And Jay from Trax.

981
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.299
The audience is stirred...

982
00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:33.439
now that Chan Yeol is out.

983
00:42:34.899 --> 00:42:37.109
Coming up next are
the hottest idols of the year.

984
00:42:37.339 --> 00:42:40.710
Bae Jin Young and
Lai Kwan Lin from Wanna One.

985
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.609
They are growing as
a global idol group.

986
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.180
Welcome.

987
00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.520
(EXO and Trax versus Wanna One)

988
00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:55.819
(It's the meeting of the two
most popular idol groups.)

989
00:42:55.819 --> 00:42:57.489
- Go, guys!
- Come on!

990
00:42:57.489 --> 00:43:01.029
- They are greeting each other.
- Yes.

991
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:04.100
Wanna One will play first.

992
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.100
(Wanna One plays
the 1st frame.)

993
00:43:06.439 --> 00:43:10.169
Wanna one's first frame begins.

994
00:43:10.169 --> 00:43:13.379
The first player is Lai Kwan Lin.

995
00:43:13.379 --> 00:43:15.379
His skin is so fair.

996
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:19.379
I envy him. I have never
had such fair skin.

997
00:43:22.689 --> 00:43:24.120
It's the first frame.

998
00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:25.850
He threw the ball.

999
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.359
Seven pins.

1000
00:43:29.489 --> 00:43:30.689
That's a nice start.

1001
00:43:30.689 --> 00:43:32.859
- Bravo.
- That was awesome.

1002
00:43:32.859 --> 00:43:35.029
That's a nice start.

1003
00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:36.230
(He's happy with the good start.)

1004
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.799
Jin Young will play next.

1005
00:43:38.799 --> 00:43:40.040
(Will Jin Young succeed
to pick up the spare?)

1006
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.200
He's getting ready.

1007
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.969
It's his chance
to pick up the spare.

1008
00:43:43.969 --> 00:43:47.009
He wrote it himself
that he was born...

1009
00:43:47.009 --> 00:43:49.180
- with talent for bowling.
- Oh, really?

1010
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.149
- All right.
- Let's see how good he is.

1011
00:43:53.779 --> 00:43:56.219
I guess he is currently
developing his talent.

1012
00:43:56.219 --> 00:43:57.689
Right.

1013
00:43:57.689 --> 00:43:59.460
I'm sure he's still not
warmed up yet.

1014
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.489
- He just came in.
- Right.

1015
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.859
You need time to warm up.

1016
00:44:02.859 --> 00:44:04.589
(It's finally Chan Yeol's turn.)

1017
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:06.899
It's Chan Yeol's turn.

1018
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.430
Chan Yeol from EXO is up next.

1019
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.899
- I am excited for him.
- I am excited for him too.

1020
00:44:13.899 --> 00:44:16.040
He's a strong front-runner.

1021
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.310
Many people praise him,
so I have high expectation for him.

1022
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.910
He checks the angle first.

1023
00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:24.210
Chan Yeol throws the ball.

1024
00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.620
It's his first ball.

1025
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.350
(9 pins)

1026
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:31.790
(He was so close
to bowling a strike.)

1027
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:33.859
It's too bad it's not a strike.

1028
00:44:33.859 --> 00:44:35.359
- It's too bad.
- Yes.

1029
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.890
- He missed 1 pin.
- Just 1 pin.

1030
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.200
I find it harder to clear it
when there's only one pin left.

1031
00:44:41.629 --> 00:44:44.899
Let's see how Jay will play.

1032
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.700
All right.

1033
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.270
He spun the ball.

1034
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.109
He did it.

1035
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:55.680
(He picks up the spare.)

1036
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.410
- He picked up the spare.
- That was so precise.

1037
00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:00.919
He picked up the spare perfectly.

1038
00:45:00.919 --> 00:45:01.919
(They are a front-runner duo.)

1039
00:45:01.919 --> 00:45:03.489
- They are amazing.
- That was a neat play.

1040
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.689
The ball suddenly...

1041
00:45:06.419 --> 00:45:08.390
- headed to the left.
- That was neat.

1042
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:09.830
- That was neat.
- They are amazing.

1043
00:45:10.359 --> 00:45:11.529
It's the second frame.

1044
00:45:12.029 --> 00:45:14.500
- It's Lai Kwan Lin.
- It's Lai Kwan Lin.

1045
00:45:16.529 --> 00:45:19.540
(Will they be able to catch up?)

1046
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.410
He threw the ball.

1047
00:45:26.779 --> 00:45:28.739
(7 pins)

1048
00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:32.719
It's the first time we had
that arrangement of pins.

1049
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.390
The ball hit the center,
and the pins...

1050
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.620
(The score difference increases,
and Wanna One gets flustered.)

1051
00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:41.689
Did the pins not move enough?

1052
00:45:41.819 --> 00:45:46.160
They either fell forwards
or backwards.

1053
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.730
The ball just shoved the pins
to the back.

1054
00:45:47.859 --> 00:45:50.799
- It hit right in the center.
- He should hit the rest.

1055
00:45:50.799 --> 00:45:52.770
It's going to be tricky
to pick up the spare.

1056
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.640
He has to hit the right side
of the sixth pin.

1057
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:58.509
- All right.
- That's it.

1058
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.009
Come on, Jin Young.

1059
00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:04.980
He only knocked down
the pin in the middle.

1060
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.279
(Wanna One versus EXO and Trax)

1061
00:46:06.279 --> 00:46:10.149
Wanna One won 15 points.

1062
00:46:11.419 --> 00:46:13.060
- It's Chan Yeol's turn again.
- It's Chan Yeol.

1063
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.390
Chan Yeol promised
to treat everyone...

1064
00:46:16.529 --> 00:46:20.029
who participated in the bowling
if he wins.

1065
00:46:20.029 --> 00:46:21.259
- Does that include us?
- Are we...

1066
00:46:21.259 --> 00:46:22.529
- included?
- Are we included?

1067
00:46:22.529 --> 00:46:24.000
What's the menu?

1068
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.239
- He's going to treat us.
- Chan Yeol is up next.

1069
00:46:27.339 --> 00:46:28.469
Go, Chan Yeol.

1070
00:46:29.609 --> 00:46:31.009
- That was good.
- That's good.

1071
00:46:31.009 --> 00:46:33.180
- That's good.
- Great.

1072
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.149
(It's the first strike.)

1073
00:46:36.649 --> 00:46:37.910
He bowled a strike.

1074
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.850
(It's because
everyone wants to be treated.)

1075
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:43.689
He's very talented.

1076
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:46.359
(Wanna One versus EXO and Trax)

1077
00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:47.859
The first frame...

1078
00:46:48.759 --> 00:46:50.890
They managed to pick up
the spare in the first frame.

1079
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:52.859
And they finished the second frame
with the strike.

1080
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.100
- He's good.
- He's a front-runner for a reason.

1081
00:46:57.669 --> 00:46:59.370
He's got a vibe of his own.

1082
00:46:59.569 --> 00:47:02.169
He releases the ball very smoothly.

1083
00:47:03.339 --> 00:47:04.540
It's going to pin 1 and pin 3.

1084
00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.910
(The ball strikes accurately
between pin 1 and pin 3.)

1085
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:09.609
The ball keeps moving...

1086
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.620
consistently to the back end.

1087
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.319
Wanna One must feel pressured.
I Hope they enjoy playing the game.

1088
00:47:19.319 --> 00:47:22.520
In this kind of situation,
they should release the pressure.

1089
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.259
I think that would be better.

1090
00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:27.629
- It's still early in the game.
- It's the start of the match.

1091
00:47:27.629 --> 00:47:29.000
- As they practiced.
- As they practiced.

1092
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.299
They'd better not care much.

1093
00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:35.899
Lai Kwan Lin decided to
"smile even if I don't do well."

1094
00:47:35.899 --> 00:47:36.969
All right.

1095
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.540
There he goes! Okay.

1096
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.609
- He's smiling.
- Yes.

1097
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:45.779
He's smiling.

1098
00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.379
He looks beautiful.

1099
00:47:48.379 --> 00:47:49.819
His facial expression is the winner.

1100
00:47:49.819 --> 00:47:51.089
(I won't forget to smile
even if I don't play well.)

1101
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.290
(He received the positive energy
from Lai Kwan Lin.)

1102
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.960
(Jin Young of Wanna One
gets the hang of it.)

1103
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.200
(Lai Kwan Lin of Wanna One
begins to play well.)

1104
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.029
(However)

1105
00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.969
It's good.

1106
00:48:06.969 --> 00:48:08.239
(EXO and Trax gets a head start
with strikes in a row.)

1107
00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:10.109
- It's accurate.
- It's perfect.

1108
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:12.169
There he goes.

1109
00:48:12.169 --> 00:48:14.140
(He shows off his skill
as a front-runner.)

1110
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.140
He's stably good.

1111
00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.080
(Jay of Trax gets a double strike.)

1112
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.549
It's a double strike.

1113
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.480
Here's a double strike.

1114
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.719
(They play perfectly.)

1115
00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:23.020
He got a double strike.

1116
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.319
This is a preliminary match.

1117
00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:28.319
I think the semi-finals and
the final match will be incredible.

1118
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.000
(Even though the game
is almost decided,)

1119
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.160
(they do their best to the end.)

1120
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.600
This is the last frame.

1121
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.700
(It's Wanna One's last frame.)

1122
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.569
I feel like he'll do well.

1123
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.910
It's Jin Young's last throw.
Strike!

1124
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.710
It's Jin Young's last throw.
Strike!

1125
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.779
He got the hang of it now.
It's amazing!

1126
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:53.180
It's incredible.

1127
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.750
Jin Young, you made it!

1128
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.419
- The last match is over.
- He did well.

1129
00:48:58.589 --> 00:49:02.089
Men's Bowling Preliminary Match
is decided.

1130
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:05.859
I've heard that Chan Yeol
is a great player.

1131
00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:08.259
I could see it with my own eyes.

1132
00:49:08.259 --> 00:49:11.230
Wanna One did their best to the end.

1133
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.100
I think it was a great match.

1134
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.310
I think they did a great job.

1135
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:17.640
Thank you for your effort.

1136
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.140
I'd like to give an applause to
Wanna One managed to keep smiling.

1137
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:26.450
Now, rhythmic gymnastics will begin.

1138
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:27.950
You're watching...

1139
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.989
2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special.

1140
00:49:30.989 --> 00:49:33.589
It's the highlight of this
championships, rhythmic gymnastics.

1141
00:49:33.759 --> 00:49:36.430
The pretty member of TWICE,
Na Yeon...

1142
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:37.560
will cast rhythmic gymnastics...

1143
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.689
- together with us.
- Welcome.

1144
00:49:38.689 --> 00:49:40.660
Hello, I'm Na Yeon,

1145
00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.529
the special caster
of rhythmic gymnastics.

1146
00:49:42.529 --> 00:49:45.000
The moment Na Yeon sat here, our
broadcasting booth became brighter.

1147
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.439
- You're right.
- Yes.

1148
00:49:46.439 --> 00:49:48.839
When we think of TWICE,
they have the best cheering song,

1149
00:49:48.839 --> 00:49:50.739
- "Cheer Up".
- Right.

1150
00:49:50.739 --> 00:49:52.370
To encourage the players,

1151
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.279
can you please sing a line
of "Cheer Up"?

1152
00:49:54.279 --> 00:49:56.910
I'll sing a line, and can you do
the dance routine with me?

1153
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.210
- We'll follow you.
- We'll do that.

1154
00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:59.620
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

1155
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.480
- Cheer up, baby
- Cheer up, baby

1156
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.020
- Hang in there
- Hang in there

1157
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.460
- You can do it!
- All right.

1158
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.660
I'm getting the energy.

1159
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.790
The players should get more energy.

1160
00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.330
(The song makes everyone
get energized.)

1161
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.899
She was an international referee
and is a commentator in MBC.

1162
00:50:15.899 --> 00:50:18.299
Commentator Cha Sang Eun is with us.

1163
00:50:18.299 --> 00:50:19.500
- Welcome!
- Nice to see you!

1164
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.540
Hello, I'm an exclusive coach and a
commentator for rhythmic...

1165
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.939
gymnastics for Idol Star Athletics
Championships, Cha Sang Eun.

1166
00:50:23.939 --> 00:50:25.870
Many people are looking forward to
this event.

1167
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.040
Would it be better this season?

1168
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.509
Can we expect more this time?
Many people are curious.

1169
00:50:30.509 --> 00:50:33.319
In this season, they practiced
even more...

1170
00:50:33.319 --> 00:50:35.219
than the last season.

1171
00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:39.589
The players' skills have greatly
improved.

1172
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:42.460
Some of them can enter the match
for elementary school athletes.

1173
00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.989
Some players are
that much competent.

1174
00:50:44.989 --> 00:50:46.759
- Elementary school games?
- Yes.

1175
00:50:46.759 --> 00:50:48.759
It's for the professional athletes.

1176
00:50:48.759 --> 00:50:51.730
- Right.
- You can look forward to this game.

1177
00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.899
Let's look at the things
you should watch out for.

1178
00:50:53.899 --> 00:50:56.469
The things you should remember
for rhythmic gymnastics.

1179
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.509
(Return of the queen versus
Birth of a new star)

1180
00:50:58.509 --> 00:51:00.839
Would it be the return
of the queen...

1181
00:51:00.839 --> 00:51:03.379
- or the birth of a new star?
- Right.

1182
00:51:03.379 --> 00:51:05.750
I looked at the list
of participants.

1183
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.819
There are many players who majored
in ballet and dance.

1184
00:51:08.819 --> 00:51:11.319
Sally of Gugudan,
Ji U of DreamCatcher,

1185
00:51:11.319 --> 00:51:13.419
Hae In of Laboum,
Rachel of April,

1186
00:51:13.419 --> 00:51:15.620
Seung Yeon of CLC,
Cheng Xiao of WJSN.

1187
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.299
A total of six players participate
in rhythmic gymnastics.

1188
00:51:19.299 --> 00:51:21.759
What's unique is,
except for Cheng Xiao,

1189
00:51:21.759 --> 00:51:24.799
every player is participating
for the first time.

1190
00:51:24.969 --> 00:51:27.469
In fact, when we think of rhythmic
gymnastics in this championships,

1191
00:51:27.469 --> 00:51:30.310
we think of Cheng Xiao
of WJSN first.

1192
00:51:31.669 --> 00:51:34.480
(Cheng Xiao of WJSN highlighted the
first page of rhythmic gymnastics.)

1193
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.509
What's that?

1194
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:37.410
It's a mastery degree technique.

1195
00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.109
She's like a professional athlete.

1196
00:51:39.279 --> 00:51:40.520
She needs to catch it.

1197
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.089
She's the one who wrote the history
of rhythmic gymnastics here.

1198
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:47.259
In the last season,
in her second match,

1199
00:51:47.259 --> 00:51:51.330
Cheng Xiao missed the gold medal
due to a small mistake.

1200
00:51:52.089 --> 00:51:53.460
(In rhythmic gymnastics match
of the 2017 Championships,)

1201
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:57.169
(Cheng Xiao unfortunately
missed the hoop.)

1202
00:51:57.969 --> 00:52:00.640
Can she write another history
in this championships?

1203
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.509
Can she make another drama?
We'll be watching her.

1204
00:52:03.509 --> 00:52:07.279
It's 2018 Idol Star Athletics
Championships - New Year Special.

1205
00:52:07.279 --> 00:52:09.980
Many people have been looking
forward to rhythmic gymnastics.

1206
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.879
Let's meet the first player.

1207
00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:13.680
It's Sally from Gugudan.

1208
00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.219
The first player is entering now.

1209
00:52:17.219 --> 00:52:20.020
Sally from Gugudan is appearing.

1210
00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.419
She's holding a hoop.

1211
00:52:21.989 --> 00:52:24.689
Her red and white costume
is really beautiful.

1212
00:52:24.689 --> 00:52:27.359
Commentator Cha,
what's Sally's concept?

1213
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.100
She prepared a graceful costume...

1214
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.140
that reminds us of a swan.

1215
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.270
To a mystic music,

1216
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.739
Sally will highlight her mystic
image by performing her emotions.

1217
00:52:37.739 --> 00:52:40.009
That's the thing
you should watch for.

1218
00:52:40.009 --> 00:52:41.140
I see.

1219
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.279
She's so beautiful.

1220
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:48.719
It starts now.

1221
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:52.919
I truly hope
she doesn't make a mistake.

1222
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:56.529
(Sally moves like a swan flying.)

1223
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.460
What's this movement?

1224
00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:05.529
She did AD well now,
the apparatus difficulty technique.

1225
00:53:05.899 --> 00:53:07.169
(After catching the apparatus,
a high-level technique continues.)

1226
00:53:07.169 --> 00:53:10.270
She now turns twice
for a risk degree technique.

1227
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.469
She caught the apparatus,
but she made a little mistake.

1228
00:53:12.469 --> 00:53:14.739
- It's not a fatal mistake, right?
- No, it isn't.

1229
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:17.980
(She expresses a swan with
an apparatus difficulty technique.)

1230
00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.080
The swan is so beautiful...

1231
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.180
- that it even looks sad.
- Oh, that's great.

1232
00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.879
- What's that?
- It's an AD technique,

1233
00:53:21.879 --> 00:53:23.790
- an apparatus difficulty technique.
- I see.

1234
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:26.759
She should check it.

1235
00:53:26.759 --> 00:53:28.359
(Sally misses the hoop.)

1236
00:53:28.359 --> 00:53:30.290
- She should have caught it.
- Right.

1237
00:53:32.529 --> 00:53:34.129
(Worried)

1238
00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:38.100
Sally has challenged herself
to high-level techniques.

1239
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.469
She should not be agitated
by those things.

1240
00:53:40.469 --> 00:53:44.469
(Sally continues with the next move
and stays calm.)

1241
00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.009
This looks like a difficult one.

1242
00:53:52.049 --> 00:53:53.120
- She did it well.
- She did a good job!

1243
00:53:53.149 --> 00:53:55.419
(She succeeds in an apparatus
difficulty technique.)

1244
00:53:55.419 --> 00:53:56.520
This looks like a difficult one.

1245
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.219
- She did it well.
- She did a good job!

1246
00:53:58.219 --> 00:53:59.219
(They're amazed.)

1247
00:54:00.259 --> 00:54:01.660
What was that movement?

1248
00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.330
As she's doing
apparatus difficulty techniques,

1249
00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.259
she's getting additional scores
for the techniques.

1250
00:54:07.259 --> 00:54:09.770
(However, she makes
another mistake.)

1251
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:11.870
- Look at her facial expression.
- Gosh, she dropped it.

1252
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:14.799
She did well, but she
also made mistakes.

1253
00:54:15.569 --> 00:54:18.169
She's very graceful
and beautiful though.

1254
00:54:18.169 --> 00:54:20.609
- Her face looks so calm.
- You're right.

1255
00:54:20.609 --> 00:54:22.850
She doesn't look much disturbed.
Good for her.

1256
00:54:25.879 --> 00:54:27.250
- Commentator Cha.
- This is the last technique.

1257
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:28.379
- The last one.
- Right.

1258
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.089
- She did it well.
- She caught it.

1259
00:54:31.089 --> 00:54:35.390
(She nicely succeeded in the last
risk degree technique.)

1260
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.989
She did a good job. Goodness.

1261
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:42.359
She played some parts so well,
and made some regrettable mistakes.

1262
00:54:42.669 --> 00:54:44.629
She looks like
she has mixed emotions.

1263
00:54:44.629 --> 00:54:48.100
It's very regrettable that she made
little mistakes.

1264
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.770
I feel sorry
that she has tearful eyes already.

1265
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:52.569
She did well. She did a good job.

1266
00:54:52.569 --> 00:54:54.609
- Her team members are crying.
- Gosh, Se Jeong is crying.

1267
00:54:54.609 --> 00:54:55.609
My goodness.

1268
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:58.379
- They know how hard she tried.
- They know it.

1269
00:54:58.379 --> 00:55:01.049
Se Jeong is crying already.
Goodness.

1270
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.989
She worked so hard, that's why.

1271
00:55:02.989 --> 00:55:07.219
She's been practicing so hard,
so diligently.

1272
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.259
Well, now...

1273
00:55:09.259 --> 00:55:10.560
Now, let's see how she did.

1274
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.759
Let's see the slow video
and analyze her performance.

1275
00:55:13.759 --> 00:55:15.259
- She did it so well at first.
- Right.

1276
00:55:15.259 --> 00:55:18.029
Her apparatus degree technique
was good this time.

1277
00:55:18.029 --> 00:55:21.299
I described it as a mastery degree
technique before.

1278
00:55:21.299 --> 00:55:23.939
- The term must have changed.
- Yes, it has changed.

1279
00:55:23.939 --> 00:55:26.339
- Apparatus difficulty degree.
- Now it's a risk degree technique.

1280
00:55:26.339 --> 00:55:27.910
- She slightly missed it.
- Yes.

1281
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:29.410
Does it make a slight deduction?

1282
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:31.509
She caught it first
and then missed it.

1283
00:55:31.509 --> 00:55:33.149
The referees will decide it.

1284
00:55:33.149 --> 00:55:34.480
They will decide it.

1285
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.589
Actually, even real athletes find
this technique hard.

1286
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:40.819
She was supposed to turn around
and catch with her legs.

1287
00:55:40.819 --> 00:55:41.989
How can she do that?

1288
00:55:41.989 --> 00:55:43.930
She succeeded when she practiced.

1289
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:45.460
I'm so sorry that
she made a mistake today.

1290
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.000
She did this well. It was
the last movement, right?

1291
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.529
- She did a good job.
- She did well.

1292
00:55:48.529 --> 00:55:52.700
It might look easy to handle a hoop,

1293
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.540
but it's very big in size,

1294
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.169
and it's heavy.

1295
00:55:56.169 --> 00:55:59.910
Throwing it high is
a difficult technique for players.

1296
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:02.750
She threw it high,
and she did it well.

1297
00:56:03.379 --> 00:56:07.319
Hello, I'm at the stadium
where rhythmic gymnastics is held.

1298
00:56:07.319 --> 00:56:10.489
I'm a rising star for MC in MBC,
Seung Kwan of Seventeen.

1299
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:13.419
- You're cute!
- You're cute!

1300
00:56:13.419 --> 00:56:16.160
They get ambitious
when they have an interview.

1301
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.830
I guess he sees
this as a pilot program.

1302
00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:19.960
He's trying to take a position.

1303
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.529
I think he will appear
in "Section TV" soon.

1304
00:56:21.529 --> 00:56:23.029
He said "a rising star for MC
in MBC".

1305
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.270
You just finished your performance
and had a seat now.

1306
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:27.640
How do you feel?

1307
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.140
I'm nervous...

1308
00:56:31.339 --> 00:56:33.009
and worried that my team members...

1309
00:56:33.009 --> 00:56:35.640
might be disappointed
even though I tried hard.

1310
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.609
- They supported her together.
- That's true.

1311
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:41.719
The hard times are coming
to her mind.

1312
00:56:41.719 --> 00:56:44.520
Se Jeong is sobbing. It's all right.

1313
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.890
- She did her best.
- She did well.

1314
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:46.919
Of course she did.

1315
00:56:46.919 --> 00:56:50.589
But I enjoyed it. Yes.

1316
00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:53.660
All right.
Then let's see the result.

1317
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.230
Let's see it together.

1318
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:56.270
(What's Sally's score?)

1319
00:56:56.299 --> 00:56:57.730
The score is here.

1320
00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:59.700
She received a total of 8.10.

1321
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.839
She received 2.85 in difficulty
and 5.25 in execution.

1322
00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:03.310
Her total score is 8.10.

1323
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.540
That's good.
She was the first competitor.

1324
00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:07.939
Let's meet the second competitor.

1325
00:57:07.939 --> 00:57:10.910
The second competitor of
rhythmic gymnastics will enter.

1326
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.680
The second competitor is
Ji U from DreamCatcher.

1327
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.919
She's tall.

1328
00:57:14.919 --> 00:57:17.620
Ji U's apparatus is the ball.

1329
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:22.759
As you can see,
she's the tallest competitor.

1330
00:57:22.859 --> 00:57:26.000
She expresses music very well.

1331
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.029
That's good.

1332
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:30.469
She will perform
to the song "Daydreamin'".

1333
00:57:31.169 --> 00:57:32.299
She started.

1334
00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.879
It's her first time competing.

1335
00:57:43.049 --> 00:57:44.149
Okay.

1336
00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:46.250
- She has beautiful lines.
- She did a good job.

1337
00:57:46.279 --> 00:57:47.649
- Yes, she did a good job.
- Yes.

1338
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.089
As you can see, she performs
in harmony with the music.

1339
00:57:51.089 --> 00:57:52.149
(It's like her moves became
one with the music.)

1340
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:54.060
She's very flexible.

1341
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.430
(Her facial expressions are
refreshing.)

1342
00:57:56.859 --> 00:57:58.790
- She has good facial expressions.
- Yes.

1343
00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:00.230
Her facial acting
is good.

1344
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:06.439
She is acting a girl who is dreaming
of falling in romantic love.

1345
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.569
- She caught it.
- Good job.

1346
00:58:10.239 --> 00:58:12.609
- She caught it.
- Good job.

1347
00:58:12.609 --> 00:58:15.040
- That's not easy.
- That's right.

1348
00:58:24.919 --> 00:58:25.919
- Oh, my.
- The ball...

1349
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.919
- No.
- It's part of her performance.

1350
00:58:27.919 --> 00:58:28.919
- Is it part of her performance?
- Yes.

1351
00:58:28.919 --> 00:58:31.589
Lee Teuk doesn't know a lot about
rhythmic gymnastics.

1352
00:58:31.629 --> 00:58:34.100
It's a technique called
"dance steps".

1353
00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.969
He doesn't know
rhythmic gymnastics well.

1354
00:58:38.299 --> 00:58:40.700
- She didn't make any mistakes.
- Yes, that's right.

1355
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:43.270
She's calmly doing a good job
just like she practiced.

1356
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.739
- It's beautiful.
- She did a good job at balancing.

1357
00:58:45.739 --> 00:58:47.810
(Ji U is performing
perfectly without a mistake.)

1358
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:50.310
(I won't miss
the ball until the end.)

1359
00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:51.480
- She caught it.
- She caught it.

1360
00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.419
- She caught it.
- She caught it.

1361
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:56.020
Yes, she did
a good job at catching it.

1362
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.359
She's doing a good job.

1363
00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:01.689
(She performed
easily until the end.)

1364
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.859
She could have been nervous
because this is her first time.

1365
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:08.730
- She finished perfectly.
- Yes.

1366
00:59:09.669 --> 00:59:14.439
There must be some details
that didn't satisfy you.

1367
00:59:14.439 --> 00:59:16.810
- Tell us.
- She did well as she practiced.

1368
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:18.069
- Did she do a good job?
- Yes.

1369
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:21.310
She had a shorter period of practice
than the other competitors.

1370
00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:24.279
- Really?
- Yes, but she practiced hard.

1371
00:59:24.279 --> 00:59:26.250
She even came to practice
on Sundays.

1372
00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.819
- Yes.
- She did well.

1373
00:59:27.819 --> 00:59:30.790
- She threw the ball.
- She threw the ball and rotated...

1374
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:34.489
and did a risk degree technique by
connecting it to another rotation.

1375
00:59:34.489 --> 00:59:37.390
It's not easy to catch
a ball after throwing it high.

1376
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:39.129
- It's not easy to just catch it.
- Yes.

1377
00:59:39.129 --> 00:59:41.399
She cleanly succeeded in balancing.

1378
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.830
- Her jumps were good.
- Her jumps were good.

1379
00:59:43.899 --> 00:59:45.870
- This is also hard.
- Yes, it is.

1380
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:48.100
- A lot of people miss this.
- Yes, that's right.

1381
00:59:48.299 --> 00:59:50.439
Her dance lines are
really beautiful.

1382
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.680
Let's check the score.

1383
00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.080
- The results are in.
- Her record will be revealed.

1384
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:57.250
It's 8.50.

1385
00:59:57.279 --> 01:00:00.250
She received 2.50 in difficulty
and 6.00 in execution.

1386
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.850
Her score is 8.50.
It's not that bad.

1387
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:05.319
The third competitor will enter.

1388
01:00:05.719 --> 01:00:07.060
Hae In from Laboum.

1389
01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.160
It's Hae In from Laboum.

1390
01:00:09.859 --> 01:00:11.390
Hae In's apparatus is...

1391
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.200
the ribbon. They have
various apparatuses.

1392
01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:18.600
(Go, Hae In.)

1393
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.200
Hae In has no experience...

1394
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.109
in rhythmic gymnastics or dance.

1395
01:00:24.009 --> 01:00:27.080
But she's really good
at using the ribbon.

1396
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.180
She has a good sense of rhythm
and expression.

1397
01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.009
She made something out of nothing.

1398
01:00:32.009 --> 01:00:33.919
- She doesn't have any experience.
- Yes.

1399
01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.850
She's going to start.

1400
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.660
It's cheerful.

1401
01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:44.759
Her outfit is
very cute and adorable.

1402
01:00:44.759 --> 01:00:47.200
What is Hae In's concept?

1403
01:00:47.399 --> 01:00:48.899
As you can see,

1404
01:00:48.899 --> 01:00:51.669
the atmosphere is
very refreshing and cheerful.

1405
01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:56.910
She prepared a performance
of a girl full of charm.

1406
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:59.739
She says that her concept is
a cheerful mischief.

1407
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.149
Yes, she's also cheerful and lovely.

1408
01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.580
(She's so cute.)

1409
01:01:09.719 --> 01:01:10.950
She threw her ribbon.

1410
01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.359
- She threw her ribbon.
- It's in the air.

1411
01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:16.730
- That's too bad.
- Oh, my.

1412
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.359
- It's not easy.
- It's not.

1413
01:01:18.359 --> 01:01:19.399
It is...

1414
01:01:19.399 --> 01:01:22.160
a ribbon longer than 5m,

1415
01:01:22.529 --> 01:01:26.739
and it's made out of silk.
The athlete must move constantly,

1416
01:01:26.739 --> 01:01:31.969
so it's hard to always make
beautiful shapes.

1417
01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:36.250
- Yes, she caught it.
- She caught it.

1418
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.810
She threw it again.

1419
01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:40.149
- Yes, she caught it.
- That's good.

1420
01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:41.879
She did a good job.

1421
01:01:41.879 --> 01:01:44.620
- Her facial expressions are good.
- Yes.

1422
01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.060
It's hard to maintain good
expressions when she's panting.

1423
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.859
(She's maintaining a cheerful face
not showing how hard it is.)

1424
01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:00.469
(AD, an apparatus difficulty)

1425
01:02:00.569 --> 01:02:03.509
- She caught it with her feet.
- She did well.

1426
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.879
She practiced this
while performing as a singer.

1427
01:02:09.879 --> 01:02:11.879
- Considering that, it's amazing.
- Yes.

1428
01:02:11.879 --> 01:02:14.219
- Hae In was very busy.
- Yes.

1429
01:02:14.219 --> 01:02:16.089
She came to practice
whenever she had the time.

1430
01:02:16.089 --> 01:02:18.850
She practiced very hard.

1431
01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.919
I think she made
a mistake from missing her ribbon...

1432
01:02:21.919 --> 01:02:24.129
and it stopped
in the middle of her performance.

1433
01:02:24.759 --> 01:02:26.660
This is the beginning of her act.

1434
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.930
Her start was
so cheerful and lovely.

1435
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:29.730
Yes, her facial expressions were
also very good.

1436
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:33.799
She is using her ribbon to make
the same shape continuously.

1437
01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:35.700
She's very good at using the ribbon.

1438
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.580
She made a mistake from throwing the
ribbon and trying to receive it.

1439
01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:43.580
Don't they get deducted heavily
in the real games when they miss it?

1440
01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.680
- Yes, they get deducted heavily.
- Yes, in the real games.

1441
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.680
- She threw it and kicked it.
- It's an AD.

1442
01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:50.589
She rolled backwards.

1443
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:52.450
She grabbed it like she's fishing.

1444
01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.319
- It's like fly-fish.
- That's right.

1445
01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:56.460
She's pulling it thinking...

1446
01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.759
- that it's a big fish.
- It's a big fish.

1447
01:02:58.759 --> 01:03:00.060
- This is her last move.
- She did well.

1448
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.629
Isn't it really hard to kick it...

1449
01:03:02.629 --> 01:03:04.330
- and then pull it back?
- That's right.

1450
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:06.739
She can get bonus points
from this technique.

1451
01:03:06.739 --> 01:03:09.200
This is Hae In from Laboum,
who performed amazingly.

1452
01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:12.879
Let's see her score.

1453
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.480
Please reveal her score.

1454
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.480
- Let's see her score.
- The highest score was...

1455
01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.719
- 8.50.
- The results are in.

1456
01:03:20.719 --> 01:03:22.219
- It's 8.80.
- Oh, my.

1457
01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:24.750
She received 2.75 in difficulty
and 6.05 in execution.

1458
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.120
Her score is 8.80.

1459
01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.259
- She's currently in first place.
- Gosh.

1460
01:03:27.259 --> 01:03:28.819
(2.75 difficulty, 6.05 execution,
0.00 deduction, 8.80 total)

1461
01:03:28.819 --> 01:03:30.390
Her members look so happy.

1462
01:03:30.529 --> 01:03:31.930
Laboum is happy.

1463
01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:33.730
Her sense of rhythm is so good.

1464
01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:36.700
We give points for dance steps.

1465
01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.129
- She had good facial expressions.
- Yes.

1466
01:03:38.129 --> 01:03:39.500
That's good.

1467
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.640
(1st place Hae In, 2nd place Ji U,
3rd place Sally)

1468
01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.839
This means...

1469
01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:44.109
Let's meet the fourth competitor.

1470
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:46.710
The fourth competitor is
Rachel from April.

1471
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:50.750
It's Rachel from April.

1472
01:03:50.879 --> 01:03:53.180
- Her apparatus is the ball.
- That's right.

1473
01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.549
According to my research,

1474
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:58.290
she's the strongest contender and
the biggest threat to Cheng Xiao.

1475
01:03:58.290 --> 01:03:59.419
- Is that right?
- Really?

1476
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:00.960
- Yes, that's right.
- Why is that so?

1477
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.029
She did ballet for seven years.

1478
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.759
She's really flexible, and
she has really good basic skills.

1479
01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:09.700
She really practiced a lot.

1480
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.129
I think she has
a strong possibility of winning.

1481
01:04:12.129 --> 01:04:14.469
She might do better here.

1482
01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.339
She kind of looks like a fairy.

1483
01:04:22.339 --> 01:04:24.009
It's very fresh.

1484
01:04:24.009 --> 01:04:25.250
She's like spring.

1485
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:26.850
Yes, it already feels like spring.

1486
01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.950
She's a rookie who is
a threat to Cheng Xiao.

1487
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:34.020
(She succeeds
the first technique perfectly.)

1488
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:38.489
- Yes, she did well.
- She did well.

1489
01:04:39.259 --> 01:04:41.830
If you watch her, you want to
automatically move to the music.

1490
01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.069
- You want to dance to it.
- Yes.

1491
01:04:45.529 --> 01:04:47.299
(Rachel moves like she's connected
to the ball.)

1492
01:04:47.299 --> 01:04:48.540
- She did well.
- That's good.

1493
01:04:49.509 --> 01:04:51.040
- She did well.
- That's good.

1494
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.480
She didn't move at all.
She's stable.

1495
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.149
- She used the AD well.
- She did well.

1496
01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:04.950
(Rachel is showing perfect balance.)

1497
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:09.489
Yes, she did
a very difficult balance.

1498
01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.089
- She's in good condition today.
- Yes.

1499
01:05:12.189 --> 01:05:16.399
Her amazing skills are
from hard practice.

1500
01:05:16.469 --> 01:05:19.169
She practiced hard, and she did
ballet for seven years.

1501
01:05:19.439 --> 01:05:21.040
That's why she
has good basic skills.

1502
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.509
- She looks confident.
- Yes.

1503
01:05:23.509 --> 01:05:25.109
(You can see from her face
that she is relaxed.)

1504
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:26.640
She did a good job.

1505
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.109
(She's expressing Tinker Bell...)

1506
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:29.580
(through ballet
and rhythmic gymnastics.)

1507
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.080
- Oh, my.
- This time...

1508
01:05:31.649 --> 01:05:33.350
This is overwhelming.

1509
01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.620
She's doing steps.

1510
01:05:34.719 --> 01:05:35.919
She only has to
not make any mistakes.

1511
01:05:35.919 --> 01:05:37.120
(Rachel is a small fairy
that overpowers the stage.)

1512
01:05:38.219 --> 01:05:39.359
Her face looks relaxed.

1513
01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.890
Yes, she's doing
a difficult risk degree technique.

1514
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:43.989
- She turned.
- She's catching it.

1515
01:05:43.989 --> 01:05:45.859
- She caught it.
- She caught it.

1516
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.000

1517
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.100
- She turned.
- She's catching it.

1518
01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.830
- She caught it.
- She caught it.

1519
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:52.939
(She did a difficult degree
technique without a mistake.)

1520
01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:55.540
- She makes me feel excited.
- That's good.

1521
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.609
(She's so cute.)

1522
01:05:56.609 --> 01:05:57.609
What's happening?

1523
01:05:58.469 --> 01:06:01.480
- She didn't make any mistakes.
- She rolled the ball well.

1524
01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.680
She's very stable.

1525
01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.549
(Rachel showed a perfect performance
without making any mistakes.)

1526
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:07.620
She succeeded.

1527
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.850
- She did really well.
- She did really well.

1528
01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:10.620
- That was Rachel.
- She did a good job.

1529
01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.890
Her facial expressions and acting
were like a professional athlete.

1530
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:14.060
- That's right.
- Yes.

1531
01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.859
I could tell that she did
a really good job.

1532
01:06:15.859 --> 01:06:17.129
- Yes, she did very well.
- It's exciting.

1533
01:06:17.629 --> 01:06:19.460
- She looked cheerful.
- She didn't make any mistakes.

1534
01:06:20.399 --> 01:06:24.230
She did an AD using her feet
to roll the ball.

1535
01:06:24.299 --> 01:06:26.969
- It was so precise.
- People usually miss the ball.

1536
01:06:26.969 --> 01:06:28.370
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, that's right.

1537
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:31.069
- She did a precise balance.
- She's really flexible.

1538
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:32.980
She did well.

1539
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:35.109
She showed
a very high-quality acting.

1540
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:37.410
- She threw the ball.
- She turned twice,

1541
01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.779
caught the ball, and
connected it to another turn.

1542
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.890
Her turn looked so easy.

1543
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:46.919
Honestly, it's not easy to throw an
apparatus and turn twice.

1544
01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.560
That's right.
People tend to be stiff.

1545
01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.830
She also kissed the ball in a lovely
and adorable way.

1546
01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:53.759
She was so lovely.

1547
01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:55.730
- This was threatening.
- That's right.

1548
01:06:55.799 --> 01:06:58.870
Her turns, facial expressions,
and performance...

1549
01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:00.700
tell that she has basic skills
to some extent.

1550
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.040
She also practiced.

1551
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.640
She's the player
who practiced the most.

1552
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.640
She's amazing.

1553
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.509
It was a performance
that made you smile.

1554
01:07:07.509 --> 01:07:09.140
That was from Rachel. Hello.

1555
01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:12.080
Hello. I'm Rachel of April.

1556
01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:15.049
- Rachel. That's a pretty name.
- Rachel.

1557
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:16.549
There's a singer named
Rachel Yamagata.

1558
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:19.589
Let's see Rachel's score.

1559
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:20.719
Here's her score.

1560
01:07:20.719 --> 01:07:24.430
The score of 8.8
was the highest so far.

1561
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.799
(Commentator Cha showered Rachel
with praise.)

1562
01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.700
(Please)

1563
01:07:30.169 --> 01:07:32.870
(Will she be able to make it
to the top rank?)

1564
01:07:34.669 --> 01:07:36.410
She received 11.70 points!

1565
01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.710
It's an overwhelming victory.

1566
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:40.839
She earned 3.85 for degree of
difficulty and 7.85 for execution.

1567
01:07:40.839 --> 01:07:44.779
(Degree of difficulty 3.85,
execution 7.85, total score 11.70)

1568
01:07:44.779 --> 01:07:47.719
She earned 3.85 for degree of
difficulty and 7.85 for execution.

1569
01:07:47.719 --> 01:07:49.589
The total score is 11.70.

1570
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:52.989
Now, she becomes a heavy favorite.

1571
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:55.120
Cheng Xiao...

1572
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.660
is also a strong candidate for
winning. She must be nervous.

1573
01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.430
Seung Yeon of CLC.

1574
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:05.029
Here's Seung Yeon of CLC.
She's holding Indian clubs.

1575
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:08.339
It's an apparatus that first appears
in the championships this time.

1576
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.770
Players see Indian clubs
as a difficult apparatus.

1577
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:13.310
They also want to avoid it.

1578
01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:14.310
It's heavy too, right?

1579
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:16.450
It's hard, and you can
get injured if you get hit with it,

1580
01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:19.250
so it's one of the apparatuses
players are afraid of.

1581
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:23.689
You can see her as a dark horse
in this competition.

1582
01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:24.819
She's so beautiful.

1583
01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:28.090
Her hair and costume look like
that of a real athlete the most.

1584
01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:29.389
I agree.

1585
01:08:29.389 --> 01:08:31.330
- She'll show the true girl crush.
- Right.

1586
01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:35.260
("Cell Block Tango", an original
sound track of musical "Chicago")

1587
01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:38.069
Indian clubs are attractive
in that aspect.

1588
01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:39.399
- Right.
- It has an intensive charm.

1589
01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:41.099
Look at her eyes.

1590
01:08:41.099 --> 01:08:43.170
(She expresses a sexy Amazon
with a strong girl crush.)

1591
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.239
Here she goes.

1592
01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:46.279
Her balance degree technique
was good.

1593
01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:47.410
- Balance degree technique.
- Yes.

1594
01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:49.580
(She caught it!)

1595
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.750
- She caught it.
- She did a good job.

1596
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:53.319
She caught it easily.

1597
01:08:56.819 --> 01:08:59.889
It's an apparatus degree technique.
She succeeded.

1598
01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.420
- She turns twice.
- She throws it high.

1599
01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.889
(Seung Yeon of CLC performs
techniques confidently.)

1600
01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:05.460
- It's good.
- She did it well.

1601
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.660
- She's incredible.
- She's really a dark horse.

1602
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.399
This is becoming a very close match
towards the end.

1603
01:09:13.139 --> 01:09:16.639
It's an AD degree technique that
moves her legs to get the apparatus.

1604
01:09:16.639 --> 01:09:20.239
It's an OST of "Chicago", and she
expresses a strong girl crush.

1605
01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:22.239
- It matches the music.
- It fits her well.

1606
01:09:22.239 --> 01:09:23.609
It's the same with her costume.

1607
01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.580
- Slowly.
- That's good.

1608
01:09:26.519 --> 01:09:28.420
It fits her well.
It's the same with her costume.

1609
01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.420
- Slowly.
- That's good.

1610
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:32.389
(She's great.)

1611
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:38.330
Here's the dance step.

1612
01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:39.630
(She performs a flashy dance step
combination.)

1613
01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:42.330
How can she turn her arms like that?
I can't believe it.

1614
01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:49.939
(She succeeds in apparatus degree
techniques in a row.)

1615
01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.080
- She catches a club with a club.
- You're right.

1616
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.210
A club to a club.

1617
01:09:55.739 --> 01:09:57.179
She's so great.

1618
01:09:58.450 --> 01:10:00.250
I'm drawn into her performance.

1619
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.050
(Her performance draws attention
from the audience as they watch it.)

1620
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:05.149
The next jump is one that even
athletes find hard.

1621
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:07.489
She did well.

1622
01:10:07.489 --> 01:10:10.989
Things will be all right
if she only doesn't make a mistake.

1623
01:10:10.989 --> 01:10:12.460
She should perform slowly
to the end.

1624
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.670
(She made the audience focused
for 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

1625
01:10:21.099 --> 01:10:23.139
Did she miss the clubs at the end?

1626
01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:25.370
I should look at it closely.

1627
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:27.779
To me, it seems like
she did her best and caught it.

1628
01:10:27.779 --> 01:10:29.040
Will it count as a successful catch?

1629
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.809
But it's her capability
to cover her mistake.

1630
01:10:31.809 --> 01:10:33.250
You're right.

1631
01:10:33.849 --> 01:10:37.790
She has to keep moving the clubs
while doing the balance movement.

1632
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.359
That's a technique that you throw
two clubs at the same time.

1633
01:10:40.359 --> 01:10:41.790
She performed it with a jump degree
technique.

1634
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:43.059
It seems that she really practiced
a lot.

1635
01:10:43.059 --> 01:10:46.630
She throws both clubs with her foot
and catches them.

1636
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.460
It's an apparatus degree technique.

1637
01:10:49.599 --> 01:10:51.700
- She turned and caught it.
- She turned and caught it.

1638
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.800
That's right.

1639
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.939
- Her facial expression is intense.
- As you see here,

1640
01:10:53.939 --> 01:10:56.069
she moves the clubs under her legs.

1641
01:10:56.069 --> 01:10:58.609
She caught a club with a club.

1642
01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:01.510
- Do athletes play this technique?
- Yes, apparatus degree technique.

1643
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:02.950
- Apparatus degree technique.
- Right.

1644
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:04.349
She throws it with her foot...

1645
01:11:04.849 --> 01:11:07.849
She made a mistake here,
but look at her face.

1646
01:11:07.849 --> 01:11:10.620
Her face is saying,
"I'm fine. I did well."

1647
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:13.559
Her face is saying,
"I didn't drop it."

1648
01:11:13.559 --> 01:11:16.160
And she looks like an athlete.

1649
01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.260
She's great.

1650
01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.160
- Goodness.
- It suits her well.

1651
01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.330
I feel so sorry. I always feel sorry
after the performance is over,

1652
01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:25.429
and it's the same when the match
is over.

1653
01:11:25.429 --> 01:11:29.470
I did well enough
as much as I had practiced...

1654
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:31.910
To be honest, I regret it.

1655
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:34.309
Even though she did well,
she seems to have regrets herself.

1656
01:11:34.309 --> 01:11:36.750
- Right.
- I'm very curious about the score.

1657
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:40.420
The players
keep turning the tables today.

1658
01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.090
Let's see the score.

1659
01:11:43.489 --> 01:11:46.590
Rachel of April
received 11.7 points.

1660
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:48.359
- Right.
- Did Seung Yeon exceed it?

1661
01:11:50.359 --> 01:11:53.059
It's 11. 50. It was so close.

1662
01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:54.229
She got 3.90
for the degree of difficulty.

1663
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:56.929
(Degree of difficulty 3.90,
execution 7.60, total score 11.50)

1664
01:11:56.929 --> 01:11:59.739
She earned 3.90 for degree of
of difficulty and 7.6 for execution.

1665
01:11:59.739 --> 01:12:01.700
The total score is 11.50.

1666
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.010
She is ranked second now.

1667
01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:05.370
She dropped the club
doing the last technique.

1668
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:06.840
- She dropped it.
- Right.

1669
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.040
Yes, some points were taken by that.

1670
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.179
- If she had caught it, who knows?
- I feel sorry about the mistake.

1671
01:12:11.179 --> 01:12:14.179
- Still, she did great.
- She did great.

1672
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:17.489
Now,
the return of the queen at last.

1673
01:12:17.489 --> 01:12:19.889
Let's meet Cheng Xiao of WJSN,

1674
01:12:19.889 --> 01:12:22.689
The sixth player enters.

1675
01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:24.630
Cheng Xiao of WJSN.

1676
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.500
Now,

1677
01:12:27.559 --> 01:12:29.099
the event of rhythmic gymnastics...

1678
01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:33.269
was chosen to be a regular event in
Idol Star Athletics Championships.

1679
01:12:33.269 --> 01:12:36.309
She's the one who made it possible.

1680
01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:39.880
The purple costume and the purple
ribbon match her so well today.

1681
01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.550
Cheng Xiao was like a girl before,

1682
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:48.779
but this time, she became
a very mature woman.

1683
01:12:48.779 --> 01:12:50.590
Today, Cheng Xiao's concept...

1684
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:54.359
is a passionate woman
who keeps challenging.

1685
01:12:54.359 --> 01:12:55.889
(Cheng Xiao, you can do it.)

1686
01:12:55.889 --> 01:12:57.689
She's standing without shaking.

1687
01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.359
Cheng Xiao is the best star that
the championships gave birth to.

1688
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:01.731
(Cheng Xiao's performance will continue
in part two soon.)
