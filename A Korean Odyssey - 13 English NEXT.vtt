1
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:40.192
I can... control souls.

2
00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:47.152
What I want is you.

3
00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:53.462
From now on, you'll stay by my side forever, unchanged

4
00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:57.942
and protect me.

5
00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:07.282
What is Son Oh Gong doing that I shouldn't call for him?

6
00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:10.502
It's something very important.
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

7
00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:16.072
He went with Bu Ja. Did something happen to Bu Ja again?

8
00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:21.902
- The one who is with Son Oh Gong isn't Bu Ja.
- What?

9
00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:27.422
The one in possession of that body right now is a priestess named Ah Sa Nyeo.

10
00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:32.262
We woke her up by mistakenly disturbing that tree.

11
00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:39.132
Ah Sa Nyeo? Then what is Son Oh Gong doing with Ah Sa Nyeo?

12
00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:42.862
I'm a priestess that can call a dragon.

13
00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:46.772
I called a dragon and crowned a king,

14
00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:55.882
but that king broke his contract of marriage with me, tricked me, and locked me up.

15
00:01:57.232 --> 00:02:04.072
I need partner who will never betray me.

16
00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:13.702
Great Sage, from now on, you need to protect me the way you've been protecting Sam Jang until now.

17
00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:28.672
You should get rid of this now.

18
00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:50.942
Now, you're mine.

19
00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:55.382
You can have it. I don't need it.

20
00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:03.022
- What the?
- I'm Oh Gong. That's Chil Gong. <i>(Oh = 5, Chil = 7)</i>

21
00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:26.532
You can have Chil Gong, but you can't have Oh Gong.

22
00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:28.782
He has another master.

23
00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:35.182
Sorry, Chil Gong! I feel bad sending you to a women with such a nasty temperament.

24
00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:40.282
But what can I do when she wants you? You go instead and do a good job.

25
00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:44.942
I'm thankful for the gift.

26
00:03:44.942 --> 00:03:51.542
This one is also cute but, as I suspected, I'm pretty sure the most suitable partner for me is you Great Sage.

27
00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:58.272
Not so sure about that. You're not pretty at all. Just so-so. What's your charm? Try appealing yourself.

28
00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:02.342
I'm extremely powerful.

29
00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:06.452
I'm a priestess with powers that Sam Jang can't hold a candle to.

30
00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:22.382
I was betrayed by a human and unfairly locked up for over a thousand years.

31
00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:28.562
I came here to complete a marriage which I wasn't able to fulfill.

32
00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:33.642
And I've decided on you, Great Sage, as my partner.

33
00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:47.102
You even called a dragon for him but your groom-to-be tricked you and locked you up. That really must've been unfair.

34
00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:51.392
I don't really care to stop you from carrying out your marriage that was incomplete.

35
00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:56.462
But I can't let you get away with saying you'll take Sam Jang's place.

36
00:04:56.462 --> 00:05:05.442
And on top of that, hearing you say that while you're wearing the face of Bu Ja whom Sam Jang cherishes, I can't bear listening to you anymore.

37
00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:14.572
Sam Jang cherished her, didn't she? How about you Son Oh Gong?

38
00:05:14.572 --> 00:05:18.832
Can you get rid of this child?

39
00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:21.682
Becoming an evil spirit was what she feared the most.

40
00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:24.322
An evil spirit? I'm not a little thing like that!

41
00:05:24.322 --> 00:05:29.282
I made a promise with Bu Ja that I'd burn her here.

42
00:05:29.282 --> 00:05:32.882
And I'm going to have to fulfill that promise now.

43
00:05:32.882 --> 00:05:37.972
I'm now that mere possessed corpse right now either. I'm very strong.

44
00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:42.362
I know. That's why I was going to have Ma Wang handle you, but I can't do that.

45
00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:48.342
Ah Sa Nyeo. You're going to have to go back to sleep here.

46
00:05:51.112 --> 00:05:54.472
I doubt this is the right time to be fighting with me though.

47
00:05:54.472 --> 00:05:57.642
No. Once I've made up my mind, I have to see it through till the end.

48
00:05:57.642 --> 00:06:00.882
If you continue like this Sam Jang will be in danger though.

49
00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:08.862
- What?
- The food that I brought for her...I wonder if she ate it yet?

50
00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:16.292
If she eats so much as just one bite of it, she'll be in danger.

51
00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:38.232
If she by chance ate it, then you'll need to hurry over there and have her take this.

52
00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:44.612
- Jin Seon Mi!
- You're here?

53
00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.722
- Are you okay?
- Why? What is it?

54
00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:49.782
Did you eat the food Bu Ja brought you?

55
00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:51.572
No.

56
00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:57.142
Oh, Son Oh Gong.

57
00:06:57.142 --> 00:06:59.522
Did you find out anything?

58
00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:01.622
- Ma Wang, are you all right?
- Why? What's wrong?

59
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.462
You're okay even though you're eating that?

60
00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:12.392
- It's good though.
- You ate all of this?!

61
00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:18.512
I was hungry so I just took some.

62
00:07:19.362 --> 00:07:21.582
You didn't notice anything strange?

63
00:07:22.162 --> 00:07:25.792
What? What is it?

64
00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:28.722
It was a little salty.

65
00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.892
You're completely fine.

66
00:07:34.312 --> 00:07:37.252
Ugh, damn it!

67
00:07:37.252 --> 00:07:40.942
What do you want me to do when I've already eaten it? Should I spit it out?

68
00:07:40.942 --> 00:07:43.132
That's not it. Just swallow it!

69
00:07:43.132 --> 00:07:46.782
Did something happen? What's wrong with you?

70
00:07:47.982 --> 00:07:50.992
That bitch tricked me.

71
00:08:00.462 --> 00:08:04.332
That monkey makes me want him.

72
00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:16.152
Horrible monkey.

73
00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:23.542
What Ah Sa Nyeo wants is to complete the marriage she couldn't fulfill?

74
00:08:23.542 --> 00:08:25.292
That's what she said.

75
00:08:25.292 --> 00:08:29.492
If she got tricked and locked up on the day of her wedding, she must have quite a big grudge.

76
00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:34.512
Isn't it a simple matter of letting her carry out her marriage and relieve her grudge?

77
00:08:34.512 --> 00:08:38.552
If we give her what she wants, then she might even give back Bu Ja's body, too.

78
00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:43.112
It would be a relief if we could end this just by doing that.

79
00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:49.092
She can't get married by herself. Is there a specific partner that she wants?

80
00:08:49.092 --> 00:08:54.752
Because she's a strong priestess, she wants a strong enough partner to match that.

81
00:08:54.752 --> 00:08:58.872
That's why I'm saying this, but how about you do it, Ma Wang?

82
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:03.702
Are you out of your mind? I've been remaining faithful to one person for 1,000 years now. That makes no sense.

83
00:09:03.702 --> 00:09:06.152
You don't want to?

84
00:09:06.152 --> 00:09:09.092
Then let's have Pal Gye do it who was close to Bu Ja.

85
00:09:10.412 --> 00:09:14.982
Jeo Pal Gye himself told me that he's the most famous Lothario evil spirit.

86
00:09:14.982 --> 00:09:16.842
Would that be okay?

87
00:09:16.842 --> 00:09:24.332
Instead of Pal Gye, I feel like there's another more appropriate partner though...

88
00:09:30.932 --> 00:09:35.882
Then there's no helping it. We'll have to send her to Oh Jeong.

89
00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:40.982
Sa Oh Jeong? Have a conscious for goodness' sake!

90
00:09:40.982 --> 00:09:44.552
Why? What's wrong with our Oh Jeong! He's rich and makes killer food.

91
00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:48.542
Don't you know how cute he is when he smiles? He's full of charms!

92
00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:51.552
Wouldn't it be best to just ask Ah Sa Nyeo in person who she wants?

93
00:09:51.552 --> 00:09:53.492
We can't do that.

94
00:09:54.672 --> 00:09:57.072
We can't listen to what she wants.

95
00:09:57.072 --> 00:10:00.402
Why not? Who is it?

96
00:10:02.472 --> 00:10:07.092
Ahem. Secretary Ma, I think Sam Jang is thirsty.

97
00:10:07.092 --> 00:10:09.362
Go with her to get more water.

98
00:10:09.362 --> 00:10:13.692
Just get the water for me please.

99
00:10:13.692 --> 00:10:18.292
Secretary Ma!

100
00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:25.152
It's this way. Let's go.

101
00:10:32.502 --> 00:10:35.232
The one Ah Sa Nyeo wants is you, right?

102
00:10:35.272 --> 00:10:39.142
She pointedly said she wanted you, didn't she?

103
00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:41.342
Yeah.

104
00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:44.642
She said she's a priestess that is more powerful than Sam Jang.

105
00:10:46.152 --> 00:10:48.212
And that she'll take Geumganggo off and be good to me.

106
00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:57.072
Oh, is that so? Then I guess a chance for you to live has come your way.

107
00:10:57.072 --> 00:11:04.112
- A chance?
- Because of your fate with Sam Jang you're either going to be killed or kill.

108
00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:12.602
If it's like that, then it's more likely that Sam Jang will die.

109
00:11:15.212 --> 00:11:17.222
As for me,

110
00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:22.262
if one of us has to die then I thought

111
00:11:22.902 --> 00:11:25.112
it would obviously be me.

112
00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:29.262
Hmm ... You must have felt it unfair.

113
00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:31.352
It is unfair.

114
00:11:32.082 --> 00:11:34.372
But...

115
00:11:37.142 --> 00:11:40.732
when I realized she could be the one to die, too,

116
00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:44.642
it feels even more unfair.

117
00:11:46.492 --> 00:11:50.412
It's unfair for me, and it's unfair for Sam Jang, too.

118
00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:58.822
I have nothing to do with it. This was all orchestrated by the heavenly realm.

119
00:11:58.822 --> 00:12:01.752
The heavenly realm arranged it.

120
00:12:09.672 --> 00:12:14.312
That psycho seems to have completely lost it now.

121
00:12:14.312 --> 00:12:20.982
Do I need to give Elder Soo Bo Ri a heads up about this?

122
00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:34.582
Great Sage!

123
00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:38.902
I'm a little busy right now.

124
00:12:55.212 --> 00:12:57.182
A death bell? What are you trying to do with this?

125
00:12:57.182 --> 00:13:01.042
Oh Gong, remember I'm your teacher.

126
00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:05.232
Who's going to kill and who's going to be killed? Tell me.

127
00:13:05.232 --> 00:13:09.552
I don't know. That's something the heavenly realm decided.

128
00:13:09.552 --> 00:13:13.442
I only knew that you two had a deadly fate.

129
00:13:13.442 --> 00:13:17.062
So it was planned like that from the beginning, huh?

130
00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:22.652
And you put a Geumganggo on me to protect her?

131
00:13:22.652 --> 00:13:26.462
If it was going to come down to kill or be killed then you shouldn't have put this damn thing on me on the first place!

132
00:13:26.462 --> 00:13:30.222
Sam Jang's summons is an important matter.

133
00:13:30.222 --> 00:13:33.442
A sacrifice is needed.

134
00:13:33.442 --> 00:13:38.352
A deadly fate? A lousy thing like that doesn't exist.

135
00:13:47.522 --> 00:13:50.362
Now that I've come this far, I'm going to protect her until the very end.

136
00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:55.722
And while I'm protecting her she will never ever die.

137
00:13:58.742 --> 00:14:03.472
They need a sacrifice? Tell this to them loud and clear:

138
00:14:03.472 --> 00:14:11.452
If you mess with the Great Sage, Son Oh Gong, the sacrifice will end up coming from their end.

139
00:14:16.782 --> 00:14:21.612
And the fact that I have to do something like this is their mistake.

140
00:14:27.832 --> 00:14:32.332
Did we really make a mistake?

141
00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:41.582
Why are you putting the blame for this on me?

142
00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:44.762
Your side was the one that made the decision!

143
00:14:49.642 --> 00:14:54.132
Son Oh Gong meeting the priestess is an opportunity for him to live.

144
00:14:54.132 --> 00:14:59.572
But I don't know if this idiot will waste this good opportunity.

145
00:14:59.572 --> 00:15:03.022
Is it really impossible to change a fate that is decided upon by the heavens?

146
00:15:03.022 --> 00:15:07.892
I'm not able to go against it either, so I've been like this for a thousand years.

147
00:15:07.892 --> 00:15:10.602
Those wretched beings.

148
00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:13.172
Great Sage's situation is different from yours, Ma Wang.

149
00:15:13.172 --> 00:15:17.922
Since he is a deity, he should be able to interfere with human lives, isn't that so?

150
00:15:18.712 --> 00:15:21.842
What would an insignificant evil spirit...

151
00:15:21.842 --> 00:15:26.872
know about what a great deity is capable of doing?

152
00:15:26.872 --> 00:15:31.512
I just need to diligently rack up points.

153
00:15:33.172 --> 00:15:38.622
Ever since you saw her ninth reincarnation, you seem to have become more anxious.

154
00:15:40.872 --> 00:15:45.962
The painful cycle of death and rebirth, we must end it for her this time around.

155
00:15:45.962 --> 00:15:50.592
In order to do that, we must safely deal with Ah Sa Nyeo.

156
00:15:50.592 --> 00:15:56.912
What Ah Sa Nyeo wants is to get married to Great Sage. Is that possible?

157
00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:05.442
That's why I've already spoken to Sam Jang.

158
00:16:11.002 --> 00:16:12.982
It's not even raining. What's wrong with the sky?

159
00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:22.242
They must have gotten a little angry also.

160
00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:24.692
Why did you come back again?

161
00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.822
I came to protect you.

162
00:16:26.822 --> 00:16:29.742
When I know that there is an evil girl around, I can't leave you alone on a night like this.

163
00:16:29.742 --> 00:16:32.992
Her eyes are black, and she's really scary.

164
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:37.442
I heard she came on to you scarily. It must have been nice.

165
00:16:41.212 --> 00:16:43.672
That Ma Wang must have said something again.

166
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.792
Whatever Ma Wang said, it's to make me look bad, so just ignore it.

167
00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:53.232
I'm not concerned about it. I heard what that woman wants is you.

168
00:16:53.232 --> 00:16:54.732
It doesn't matter to me.

169
00:16:54.732 --> 00:16:55.782
Does it really not matter?

170
00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:58.792
Even if it mattered to me, will anything change?

171
00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:01.802
Fine, you marry that woman.

172
00:17:01.802 --> 00:17:03.592
Is that some great thing?

173
00:17:03.592 --> 00:17:06.402
The lids are switched. That one doesn't go with that.

174
00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:09.662
Whether you have a wedding or not, it doesn't matter to me.

175
00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:12.662
I said that those don't go together.

176
00:17:12.662 --> 00:17:15.812
Is that important right now? Is it important that these don't match?

177
00:17:15.812 --> 00:17:17.722
It's important.

178
00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:26.762
This and this are a match.

179
00:17:26.762 --> 00:17:35.782
But if you ask this one to be a match with this one, then of course the lid will open.

180
00:17:43.572 --> 00:17:46.472
That's why your lid is open (furious) right now.

181
00:17:46.472 --> 00:17:48.622
It's completely open.

182
00:17:50.422 --> 00:17:52.442
I'll close it for you.

183
00:17:56.702 --> 00:17:58.972
What are you doing right now?

184
00:17:58.972 --> 00:18:01.042
Do you think this is enough?

185
00:18:01.772 --> 00:18:03.882
Close it tighter.

186
00:18:05.212 --> 00:18:08.192
You've gotten more slick, my Sam Jang.

187
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:16.432
I'm sorry, Son Oh Gong. I awoke something strange.

188
00:18:18.502 --> 00:18:21.182
So I know shouldn't get angry at you.

189
00:18:22.932 --> 00:18:24.792
It's Ma Wang's fault.

190
00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:27.982
When you're suffering, blame others. It's good for your mental health.

191
00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:30.362
I'm scared.

192
00:18:30.362 --> 00:18:35.182
Like that other time, I might make you hurt again. I'm scared.

193
00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:40.682
Just hold tight onto me. Then we'll be fine.

194
00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:01.252
That sarcophagus is over a thousand years old.

195
00:19:02.692 --> 00:19:07.202
Looking at the patterns inside, it seems like it was done to seal whatever was contained in it.

196
00:19:07.202 --> 00:19:12.252
Yes, it must have been something that was considered extremely dangerous.

197
00:19:13.482 --> 00:19:17.052
You said they are talisman with very strong incantations, right?

198
00:19:18.412 --> 00:19:21.372
It must have been a being that was extremely feared.

199
00:19:33.592 --> 00:19:36.382
This type of dragon symbolizes a king.

200
00:19:36.382 --> 00:19:39.762
A dragon like this wouldn't be engraved just anywhere.

201
00:19:41.662 --> 00:19:45.432
The owner of that sarcophagus had as much power as a king,

202
00:19:45.432 --> 00:19:48.892
Or it's possible they were a being with more power than a king.

203
00:19:48.892 --> 00:19:50.832
It seems so.

204
00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:57.102
That means they were dangerous, feared, and also strong.

205
00:19:57.102 --> 00:19:59.342
That's quite interesting.

206
00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:11.582
Oh, pretty lady, I'm sorry.

207
00:20:11.582 --> 00:20:14.132
You're quite a beautiful woman.

208
00:20:14.132 --> 00:20:17.332
So we were thinking of buying you a drink.

209
00:20:18.562 --> 00:20:19.882
Am I pretty?

210
00:20:19.882 --> 00:20:23.132
Oh, of course! You're really pretty.

211
00:20:23.132 --> 00:20:26.282
So, do you want to go with us?

212
00:20:26.282 --> 00:20:27.362
Okay.

213
00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:29.162
Let's go.

214
00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:58.352
I can't recover my blood's strength with these types of things.

215
00:21:00.022 --> 00:21:02.762
I need Sam Jang's body.

216
00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:10.012
<i>I can't let you get away with saying you'll take Sam Jang's place.</i>

217
00:21:17.372 --> 00:21:19.792
Should I make good use of Ma Wang?

218
00:21:20.552 --> 00:21:23.172
Since I know his weakness.

219
00:21:46.802 --> 00:21:51.422
There is a rose scent that comes from the Priestess Ah Sa Nyeo?

220
00:21:51.422 --> 00:21:55.252
Yes. You have a lotus flower scent, hers is rose.

221
00:21:55.252 --> 00:22:00.832
But I heard that she's very strong. Why don't I have any strength?

222
00:22:00.832 --> 00:22:03.742
It would be nice if I was good at something also.

223
00:22:03.742 --> 00:22:09.112
Your blood is stronger. She just woke up in someone else's body.

224
00:22:09.112 --> 00:22:14.732
In any case, it's worrisome. I heard that she needs to be sent back safely to get Bu Ja's body back

225
00:22:14.732 --> 00:22:17.632
and for Ma Wang to protect his points also.

226
00:22:18.292 --> 00:22:21.852
Just what was Ma Wang crying to you about?

227
00:22:26.462 --> 00:22:34.172
<i>I'm almost a deity, but I'm going to have points taken away again.</i>

228
00:22:34.172 --> 00:22:36.322
<i>Ma Wang.</i>

229
00:22:39.002 --> 00:22:42.292
<i>I need to do what Ah Sa Nyeo wants,</i>

230
00:22:42.292 --> 00:22:45.382
<i>And put her back to sleep gently.</i>

231
00:22:45.382 --> 00:22:49.932
<i>In order to do that, let's send our Son Oh Gong.</i>

232
00:22:49.932 --> 00:22:54.682
<i>But still, to send him off to get married is a bit...</i>

233
00:22:54.682 --> 00:22:56.692
<i>It's just a formality.</i>

234
00:22:56.692 --> 00:23:03.282
<i>But still, his heart is yours, Sam Jang. Is having a wedding such a big deal?</i>

235
00:23:04.582 --> 00:23:07.442
<i>And we can save Bu Ja as well.</i>

236
00:23:08.052 --> 00:23:10.062
<i>Bu Ja?</i>

237
00:23:15.492 --> 00:23:18.232
<i>Bu Ja.</i>

238
00:23:19.342 --> 00:23:23.252
<i>Poor Zombie.</i>

239
00:23:23.252 --> 00:23:31.162
<i>Our Bu Ja, who still needs to be reincarnated.</i>

240
00:23:33.142 --> 00:23:36.742
<i>My points!</i>

241
00:23:45.752 --> 00:23:49.642
If it's just a formality, then you should just get married.

242
00:23:49.642 --> 00:23:50.852
Are you really okay with it?

243
00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:55.162
It's fine. I've already done it with you twice.

244
00:23:55.162 --> 00:23:58.662
We pretended to do it twice, in order to chase away evil spirits.

245
00:23:58.662 --> 00:24:03.282
If I think of it as similar to that, I'm fine with it.

246
00:24:03.282 --> 00:24:06.902
Ah Sa Nyeo is said to be dangerous if left alone.

247
00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:12.152
Let's call her, placate her, and send her away.

248
00:24:12.152 --> 00:24:14.322
Since I'm Sam Jang.

249
00:24:16.432 --> 00:24:18.652
Should we do it one more time?

250
00:24:18.652 --> 00:24:20.382
Do what?

251
00:24:23.882 --> 00:24:30.082
Two times were fake. Should we do it a third time for real?

252
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.582
Do you want to marry me?

253
00:24:43.392 --> 00:24:46.842
Is that... possible?

254
00:24:46.842 --> 00:24:49.842
I said I would do anything you wanted.

255
00:24:49.842 --> 00:24:53.152
If you want to, then anything is possible.

256
00:24:53.152 --> 00:24:58.922
Then you can't run away from me, even if you take off the Geumganggo.

257
00:25:00.022 --> 00:25:01.792
That's fine.

258
00:25:04.022 --> 00:25:05.972
Jin Seon Mi,

259
00:25:08.162 --> 00:25:10.262
Hold onto me even tighter.

260
00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:19.132
Right now, you're about to make a contract that can't be broken eternally.

261
00:25:19.132 --> 00:25:21.242
That's fine, a contract.

262
00:25:22.832 --> 00:25:25.522
Tell me the conditions of the contract.

263
00:25:25.522 --> 00:25:27.482
A contract...

264
00:25:31.752 --> 00:25:37.292
Should be made seriously. I won't do it quickly like when I was young.

265
00:25:38.852 --> 00:25:44.222
As expected, you've become smarter since you've aged. Do whatever you want.

266
00:25:44.222 --> 00:25:45.812
Okay.

267
00:25:49.902 --> 00:25:53.842
I got so angry today, I have a terrible headache.

268
00:25:53.842 --> 00:25:56.712
I'll have to sleep here tonight.

269
00:25:56.712 --> 00:25:59.432
If you're tired, then why are you sleeping here?

270
00:25:59.432 --> 00:26:04.822
Right? Then let's go sleep in the bed. You must be tired, so let's hurry up and sleep.

271
00:26:04.822 --> 00:26:08.182
Don't try anything tonight. Before you get cursed out, leave nicely.

272
00:26:08.182 --> 00:26:11.752
So what if I get cursed out? I can't leave nicely.

273
00:26:11.752 --> 00:26:16.092
After what I just said to you, do you want to send me away nicely?

274
00:26:16.722 --> 00:26:20.192
I don't want to send you nicely. Do you think it's easy to send you away nicely?

275
00:26:20.192 --> 00:26:22.602
I'm working hard to protect you.

276
00:26:22.602 --> 00:26:25.502
Before I curse, leave quickly.

277
00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:34.112
She was protecting me?

278
00:26:34.112 --> 00:26:36.282
Because our Oh Gong is precious?

279
00:26:36.282 --> 00:26:39.912
Ah, but I like being handled carelessly. Ah, seriously.

280
00:26:57.282 --> 00:27:01.842
I heard that the child was kidnapped at a bus stop and killed on a rainy day.

281
00:27:01.842 --> 00:27:08.332
And I also heard that she sits out there every day because of the guilt for not going out to receive her child.

282
00:27:19.952 --> 00:27:22.382
Pardon me.

283
00:27:22.382 --> 00:27:24.682
You just dropped your bag.

284
00:27:29.862 --> 00:27:31.652
Thank you.

285
00:27:48.482 --> 00:27:51.652
Why did you approach that woman?

286
00:27:56.532 --> 00:27:59.992
Just to let you know, that woman carries this sort of stuff in her bag.

287
00:27:59.992 --> 00:28:03.412
It looked like a dangerous object so I managed to take it away from her.

288
00:28:12.812 --> 00:28:18.242
Is there anything else you haven't reported to me?

289
00:28:19.032 --> 00:28:24.052
She stabbed a female student not too long ago.

290
00:28:30.722 --> 00:28:36.382
She stabbed an underage girl who was released from prison after killing her daughter.

291
00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:40.492
She wasn't able to kill the girl but it looks like she might be making another attempt at it.

292
00:28:46.092 --> 00:28:51.642
A female student who slashed a little eight year old child to death was discharged from prison within three years.

293
00:28:52.492 --> 00:28:57.102
And I guess it was too painful for her to see that.

294
00:29:03.102 --> 00:29:06.742
It's another repeat of the same old life all over again.

295
00:29:07.592 --> 00:29:09.562
Die!

296
00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:13.652
<i>Experiencing the pain of her child dying.</i>

297
00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:19.172
<i>And stabbing the enemy. And in the end, she dies as well.</i>

298
00:29:19.172 --> 00:29:22.152
<i>A continuous repetition of a tragic life...</i>

299
00:29:27.862 --> 00:29:29.532
You can't, Ma Wang.

300
00:29:29.532 --> 00:29:33.792
If you interfere she'll receive even more pain.

301
00:29:34.432 --> 00:29:37.932
Should I help you?

302
00:29:37.932 --> 00:29:40.782
I think I would be able to help.

303
00:29:40.782 --> 00:29:42.162
Please shut your mouth miss.

304
00:29:42.162 --> 00:29:46.382
Please stay quietly until your find your stone coffin and fall asleep again.

305
00:29:46.382 --> 00:29:49.752
I just want to help Ma Wang since he helped me to wake up from my sleep.

306
00:29:49.752 --> 00:29:53.652
- Please leave. - Secretary Ma, just let her be.

307
00:29:53.652 --> 00:29:55.592
Ma Wang...

308
00:30:01.952 --> 00:30:04.602
Secretary Ma, please step away for a bit.

309
00:30:13.822 --> 00:30:16.532
Let me at least here you out.

310
00:30:16.532 --> 00:30:21.632
You said you were Ah Sa Nyeo. What can you do for me?

311
00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:23.902
I'm a priestess.

312
00:30:23.902 --> 00:30:29.672
So I am capable of a lot of things...

313
00:30:47.162 --> 00:30:49.352
Why don't you postpone the ceremony to an hour later?

314
00:30:49.352 --> 00:30:50.892
Yes, sir.

315
00:31:00.582 --> 00:31:05.132
What brings you here to the company today, sir?

316
00:31:05.892 --> 00:31:09.132
The chairman is a very busy man, so of course I should come and visit since I got nothing better to do.

317
00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:12.562
I'm sorry sir, I will have more free time pretty soon.

318
00:31:12.562 --> 00:31:16.312
So I will stop by your place and clean up that house that's long been overdue.

319
00:31:16.312 --> 00:31:21.672
By the way, I was concerned about the White Kimchee that I made for you and was wondering if the flavors came out right.

320
00:31:21.672 --> 00:31:25.582
I didn't visit you because of the White Kimchee, but I came here to see you because there is something that I want you to find out for me.

321
00:31:25.582 --> 00:31:27.452
Of course, please let me know what it is.

322
00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:31.502
Go find out about the priestess. She has been around for 1,200 years.

323
00:31:31.502 --> 00:31:34.132
She calls herself Ah Sa Nyeo.

324
00:31:34.132 --> 00:31:39.212
Also, look into the person named Kang Dae Sung while you're at it as well.

325
00:31:39.212 --> 00:31:43.042
Are you talking about Professor Kang Dae Sung from Hankook University?

326
00:31:43.042 --> 00:31:44.782
Why, what's wrong?

327
00:31:44.782 --> 00:31:50.132
The priestess told me that she can call for a dragon to make a king out of a person. And that worries me.

328
00:31:50.132 --> 00:31:53.122
Yes sir, I understand.

329
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:56.842
By the way, hyungnim...

330
00:31:56.842 --> 00:32:02.562
So the person that looked like Bu Ja wasn't really her?

331
00:32:02.562 --> 00:32:04.932
That's Ah Sa Nyeo.

332
00:32:09.682 --> 00:32:14.442
I'm worried about her going around everywhere and bewitching people again.

333
00:32:17.562 --> 00:32:19.112
So, you're not Bu Ja, huh?

334
00:32:19.112 --> 00:32:22.332
That's right. My name is Ah Sa Nyeo.

335
00:32:22.332 --> 00:32:25.592
Bu Ja was a little sister to me, Jeo Pal Gye.

336
00:32:25.592 --> 00:32:31.262
Bu Ja's real name was Jeong Se Ra, and Bu Ja asked me to keep calling her Bu Ja.

337
00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:33.162
I will be leaving now.

338
00:32:47.892 --> 00:32:50.532
Hey Bu Ja, you are listening right?

339
00:32:50.532 --> 00:32:54.982
You said that you wanted to meet your family, right? I will make sure to find them for you.

340
00:32:57.932 --> 00:33:03.462
I'm not Bu Ja, and I have no need to meet a so-called family.

341
00:33:05.042 --> 00:33:10.162
I'm going to make sure to fulfill my little sister's wish.

342
00:33:21.242 --> 00:33:26.472
What is this? Is she still in here?

343
00:33:35.802 --> 00:33:40.882
We'll have to see the certified copy of the register, but it seems like there are some unresolved issues.

344
00:33:42.972 --> 00:33:45.122
<i>Do you want to marry me?</i>

345
00:33:47.972 --> 00:33:49.592
CEO.

346
00:33:51.432 --> 00:33:55.302
What have you been thinking about all day anyway?

347
00:33:55.302 --> 00:33:57.602
You're married right?

348
00:33:57.602 --> 00:34:01.662
Of course I am. I have two kids. Look.

349
00:34:01.662 --> 00:34:05.952
You're wearing a wedding ring because you love your wife, right?

350
00:34:05.952 --> 00:34:07.602
That's right.

351
00:34:08.702 --> 00:34:11.382
Then let's say that ...

352
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:14.162
you didn't love her at first...

353
00:34:14.162 --> 00:34:20.152
but the moment you put the wedding ring on your finger you all of a sudden fell madly in love.

354
00:34:20.152 --> 00:34:23.102
Then would it be okay to get married?

355
00:34:23.102 --> 00:34:28.042
We put the wedding ring on each other because we felt madly in love with one another.

356
00:34:28.042 --> 00:34:30.352
That's not what I meant...

357
00:34:30.352 --> 00:34:34.572
What I'm saying is, there was no love at first but the bracelet— I mean...

358
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:39.312
after putting the ring on, you fall madly in love.

359
00:34:40.212 --> 00:34:45.512
Miss CEO, did you a buy a ring for Secretary Son?

360
00:34:45.512 --> 00:34:51.302
I guess you put a ring on him with a diamond this big which springs up love that didn't exist before, didn't ya?

361
00:34:51.302 --> 00:34:53.502
That's not love.

362
00:34:53.502 --> 00:34:57.812
A love like that will be over once you take the ring off.

363
00:34:57.812 --> 00:34:59.442
Diamond, geesh.

364
00:35:05.792 --> 00:35:08.722
It's a bracelet, not a ring.

365
00:35:24.002 --> 00:35:26.532
Miss C.E.O, please pass me the stamp.

366
00:35:27.482 --> 00:35:30.022
Ma'am, stamp please.

367
00:35:30.022 --> 00:35:32.032
Oh, okay.

368
00:35:34.462 --> 00:35:38.332
If the love that wasn't there before came to be because of a thing,

369
00:35:38.332 --> 00:35:41.592
then once that thing disappears, the love will disappear, too.

370
00:35:41.592 --> 00:35:45.852
You shouldn't trust that type of stuff and get married you know.

371
00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:47.772
Is that how it is?

372
00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:50.272
♫ <i>Whatever you do</i> ♫

But if I set about a hundreds diamonds in it

381
00:36:30.472 --> 00:36:35.912
and keep on giving until I die, then the love won't disappear, right?

382
00:36:36.922 --> 00:36:39.232
Then I can do it, right?

383
00:36:39.232 --> 00:36:44.552
If you are so capable to the point where you're able to provide him with a bigger and bigger and bigger stone for the rest of your life

384
00:36:44.552 --> 00:36:47.132
then you should go for it.

385

It would be great if you can give me a raise instead.

Miss C.E.O...Miss C.E.O...

398
00:37:48.142 --> 00:37:51.302
Miss C.E.O, you gave me the wrong stamp.

399
00:37:53.492 --> 00:37:57.082
Seriously, women are so difficult.

400
00:37:57.082 --> 00:38:01.352
Oh man, I think I'm gonna get sick.

401
00:38:06.022 --> 00:38:11.002
Bu Ja, you came to visit. You were severely injured before. Is your body okay now?

402
00:38:11.002 --> 00:38:13.162
Should I chill you a little bit more?

403
00:38:14.512 --> 00:38:19.172
You... Something about you has really changed.

404
00:38:21.412 --> 00:38:23.122
You're not Bu Ja, I see.

405
00:38:23.122 --> 00:38:25.922
Long time no see, General Winter.

406
00:38:25.922 --> 00:38:28.122
Who are you?

407
00:38:28.122 --> 00:38:30.362
You don't recognize me?

408
00:38:31.062 --> 00:38:33.362
How sad.

409
00:38:33.362 --> 00:38:38.072
Then again, it's been over 1,000 years since we've seen each other, hasn't it?

410
00:38:38.072 --> 00:38:43.052
I see you two siblings are still sharing one body.

411
00:38:44.882 --> 00:38:46.592
Ah Sa Nyeo?

412
00:38:46.592 --> 00:38:51.722
I met with your little sister. I even got a lipstick as a gift from her.

413
00:38:52.582 --> 00:38:55.822
You met with my sister?

414
00:38:55.822 --> 00:38:59.632
She doesn't know anything about you.

415
00:38:59.632 --> 00:39:04.882
Even though I'm the one that allowed her extinguished soul to survive by putting it in her brother's body.

416
00:39:05.752 --> 00:39:09.302
Isn't it uncomfortable sharing your body with your sister?

417
00:39:09.302 --> 00:39:14.212
Even now, I can still take out her soul for you and make her extinct.

418
00:39:15.692 --> 00:39:19.962
Why did you come to see me?

419
00:39:19.962 --> 00:39:24.962
You're going to need to help me now.

420
00:39:26.472 --> 00:39:30.872
To start, you need to find the censer that I used before.

421
00:39:33.272 --> 00:39:35.162
You're going to help me, right?

422
00:39:38.812 --> 00:39:42.232
Ma Wang got beguiled by Ah Sa Nyeo? How?

423
00:39:42.232 --> 00:39:46.102
He met the Princess Iron Fan's ninth reincarnation.

424
00:39:49.472 --> 00:39:51.182
And so he must have gotten impatient.

425
00:39:51.182 --> 00:39:53.932
Ah Sa Nyeo is planning on doing something dangerous.

426
00:39:53.932 --> 00:39:57.732
Please stop Ma Wang, Great Sage.

427
00:40:00.202 --> 00:40:05.752
Then are you telling me that the solution Ah Sa Nyeo spoke of is possible?

428
00:40:05.752 --> 00:40:09.692
It's possible, but it's too dangerous of a method.

429
00:40:09.692 --> 00:40:12.562
As long as it's possible, that's enough.

430
00:40:13.262 --> 00:40:17.742
Ma Wang, don't rush into anything.

431
00:40:17.742 --> 00:40:21.352
Just continue working towards becoming a deity and wait for the time to come.

432
00:40:23.712 --> 00:40:26.652
I've already waited 1,000 years.

433
00:40:26.652 --> 00:40:33.742
If there's a way that's available to me right now, then I'll do whatever it is.

434
00:40:33.742 --> 00:40:37.852
That woman is the Princess Iron Fan that committed a terrifying sin!

435
00:40:43.412 --> 00:40:46.602
I'll pay the price for that crime.

436
00:40:46.602 --> 00:40:49.472
Isn't that good enough then?!

437
00:41:00.442 --> 00:41:04.532
I can't stop him. He said he was going to stick by the rules.

438
00:41:13.042 --> 00:41:15.552
What do you want me to do!

439
00:41:15.552 --> 00:41:20.732
So then why did you put me in charge of the ones with bad tempers?!

440
00:41:49.032 --> 00:41:53.802
<i>Ma Wang's lover was originally a deity named Cha Eun.</i>

441
00:41:56.932 --> 00:41:59.842
What sort of crime did she commit?

442
00:41:59.842 --> 00:42:05.072
She stole the souls of human children in order to save her own child.

443
00:42:07.302 --> 00:42:11.132
I hereby sentence Princess Iron Fan to punishment.

444
00:42:11.132 --> 00:42:12.832
Yes, sir!

445
00:42:15.222 --> 00:42:20.122
Princess Iron Fan, you are now banished from the heavenly realm.

446
00:42:32.232 --> 00:42:35.862
<i>Cha Eun!</i>

447
00:42:50.532 --> 00:42:55.772
After that for 1000 years, she's been through 9 painful reincarnations.

448
00:42:55.772 --> 00:42:57.632
How much does she still have left?

449
00:42:57.632 --> 00:43:03.222
Out of 108, she's already gone through 9, so she has 99 more to go.

450
00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:07.492
If she went through 9 lives in 1,000 years,

451
00:43:07.492 --> 00:43:12.882
then it'll take more than 10,000 years for her to go through 99 lives.

452
00:43:12.882 --> 00:43:18.512
Ma Wang intends to take on that 10,000 years worth of pain all at once.

453
00:43:18.512 --> 00:43:21.372
Did the Princess Iron Fan's child die?

454
00:43:21.372 --> 00:43:24.002
It's possible that Ma Wang will die.

455
00:43:24.002 --> 00:43:28.062
Sam Jang, give it a shot to try to stop him.

456
00:43:31.182 --> 00:43:33.632
10,000 years of pain...

457
00:43:37.352 --> 00:43:40.002
That's sure to hurt really bad.

458
00:43:40.002 --> 00:43:46.202
I was roasted in the Bagua Crucible for 49 days, but I bet that's going to hurt 1,200 times worse.

459
00:43:46.202 --> 00:43:48.862
Don't make me scared.

460
00:43:52.272 --> 00:43:54.162
You shouldn't do it.

461
00:43:55.732 --> 00:43:57.632
I'm going to do it.

462
00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.022
You trust Ah Sa Nyeo?

463
00:44:00.022 --> 00:44:03.992
If she tricks me, you'll kill her.

464
00:44:03.992 --> 00:44:06.022
You trust me?

465
00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:11.652
You owe us a debt, don't you?

466
00:44:14.572 --> 00:44:20.812
When we were broken up, she wanted to tell me to get back together

467
00:44:20.812 --> 00:44:25.672
so she had Pachoseon sent to me through a deity acquaintance of hers.

468
00:44:29.492 --> 00:44:33.072
If that thug of a deity

469
00:44:35.682 --> 00:44:41.362
hadn't pocketed that, then we would have been able to make up.

470
00:44:41.362 --> 00:44:42.792
Isn't that right?

471
00:44:42.792 --> 00:44:46.202
I thought it would be fine if I took my time to take it to you.

472
00:44:46.202 --> 00:44:50.122
Did you think I knew that in the meantime she'd get involved in an incident and kicked out of the heavenly realm?

473
00:44:50.122 --> 00:44:55.862
I was going to give it to you later but then I got locked up in the Five Elements Mountain all of a sudden and so I couldn't do so.

474
00:44:55.862 --> 00:45:01.422
Whatever. Just repay that debt now.

475
00:45:01.422 --> 00:45:03.782
Don't get in the way

476
00:45:06.162 --> 00:45:08.232
and take care of the aftermath for me.

477
00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:13.962
Do you really have to do this?

478
00:45:17.642 --> 00:45:19.932
If it were you, would you not do it?

479
00:45:20.802 --> 00:45:23.142
When there's a way,

480
00:45:25.372 --> 00:45:27.452
would it be possible for you to not do it?

481
00:45:35.012 --> 00:45:37.082
I wouldn't be able to resist doing it.

482
00:45:50.122 --> 00:45:52.662
Hey! You, there!

483
00:45:52.662 --> 00:45:54.982
Stop right there! Hey!

484
00:45:56.732 --> 00:45:58.622
Who are you two?

485
00:46:09.852 --> 00:46:13.222
We're here to get something. Please open the door.

486
00:46:13.222 --> 00:46:16.382
Why you people-! Are you kidding me-

487
00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:29.082
Yes, I understand.

488
00:46:33.132 --> 00:46:35.472
The door has opened.

489
00:46:53.992 --> 00:46:56.672
It's there just as you said it would be.

490
00:46:58.262 --> 00:46:59.942
Take it out.

491
00:47:41.102 --> 00:47:46.982
You used that censer to put my sister's soul in me, didn't you?

492
00:47:46.982 --> 00:47:49.882
It's because I can manipulate souls.

493
00:47:52.282 --> 00:47:56.432
What do you intend to do with that censer this time?

494
00:47:56.432 --> 00:47:59.632
I'm going to switch souls this time.

495
00:47:59.632 --> 00:48:03.922
Whose soul are you going to switch with who?

496
00:48:05.712 --> 00:48:08.312
Mine with Sam Jang's.

497
00:48:08.312 --> 00:48:10.302
Ah Sa Nyeo.

498
00:48:12.682 --> 00:48:18.322
In order to do that I need to first put Sam Jang's blood in that censer and mix it with mine.

499
00:48:18.322 --> 00:48:22.492
I should be able to get Sam Jang's blood if I use Ma Wang.

500
00:48:34.422 --> 00:48:38.372
How nice it is that I'm getting to eat Sa Oh Jeong's homemade food for the first time in a while.

501
00:48:38.372 --> 00:48:41.692
My my, you made my favorite mushroom porridge.

502
00:48:41.692 --> 00:48:44.892
Hyungnim had me make it for you.

503
00:48:45.952 --> 00:48:48.862
Why isn't there the napa kimchi that Ma Wang likes?

504
00:48:48.862 --> 00:48:50.962
It's not fully fermented yet.

505
00:48:50.962 --> 00:48:53.032
He won't be able to wait until then.

506
00:48:53.032 --> 00:48:54.802
Give it to him to eat quickly.

507
00:48:54.802 --> 00:48:56.452
Okay.

508
00:49:02.582 --> 00:49:04.522
What are you doing?

509
00:49:04.522 --> 00:49:07.722
I will live until the napa kimchi is fermented.

510
00:49:07.722 --> 00:49:10.352
I won't die. What's with you?

511
00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:13.792
You never know what will happen. Eat up and go.

512
00:49:16.792 --> 00:49:20.362
You have scheduled events for today. What are you doing here?

513
00:49:20.362 --> 00:49:25.492
Hyungnim Oh Gong told me to say farewell to you. Where are you going, Ma Wang?

514
00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:41.402
I will be leaving, but I'll come back. I will definitely come back.

515
00:49:41.402 --> 00:49:45.942
Right? Geez, he called me for no-good reason.

516
00:49:45.942 --> 00:49:49.162
Pal Gye, just a moment.

517
00:49:49.162 --> 00:49:56.362
I'll say this just in case: Good work collecting all those energy beads all this time.

518
00:49:56.362 --> 00:49:59.902
They're stashed in a safe so if you need them take them.

519
00:49:59.902 --> 00:50:06.682
Secretary Ma knows the password so, instead of fighting, be friendly with each other and share them.

520
00:50:06.682 --> 00:50:08.362
I can really use them?

521
00:50:08.362 --> 00:50:11.872
That's right. You may go.

522
00:50:16.492 --> 00:50:18.202
See ya.

523
00:50:21.262 --> 00:50:22.842
Next.

524
00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:32.932
What's this? Did the dragon sea palace contact you?

525
00:50:32.932 --> 00:50:35.942
Go and say good-bye to Ma Wang.

526
00:50:38.582 --> 00:50:43.092
Forget it! I don't need a farewell from you. Just go back to the dragon sea palace!

527
00:51:01.442 --> 00:51:04.682
Ma Wang, is there any one else you want to say good-bye to?

528
00:51:04.682 --> 00:51:09.232
Why do you keep making me out to be like a bull on a slaughterhouse table? I'm not going to die!

529
00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:14.342
Of course you're not going to die. But even so, we should say good-bye.

530
00:51:14.342 --> 00:51:19.522
Ah, there's someone that you definitely need to see before you go, right?

531
00:51:19.522 --> 00:51:22.022
I'll bring them to you. Just wait.

532
00:51:24.972 --> 00:51:27.012
He's really enjoying this.

533
00:51:27.012 --> 00:51:29.492
He's having the time of his life thinking that I'm going to die!

534
00:51:29.492 --> 00:51:33.302
That thug! Nut job!

535
00:51:36.812 --> 00:51:38.562
Why are those two acting like that?

536
00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.532
Don't know.

537
00:51:41.332 --> 00:51:43.762
You have a photo-shoot today, right? Let's go together.

538
00:51:43.762 --> 00:51:48.462
I'm not going there. I'm going to go find Bu Ja's mother.

539
00:51:48.462 --> 00:51:51.232
She's not Bu Ja anymore.

540
00:51:52.700 --> 00:52:00.210
She's still Bu Ja! She's still my younger brother! Don't make me have to listen to even you tell me she's not Bu Ja.

541
00:52:01.572 --> 00:52:04.482
I'm sorry for pretending to be Bu Ja the other night.

542
00:52:04.482 --> 00:52:05.982
I was testing you.

543
00:52:05.982 --> 00:52:09.322
- For what?
- Your ability.

544
00:52:09.322 --> 00:52:13.842
How is it possible that a special person like Sam Jang wasn't able to tell that a soul had changed?

545
00:52:13.842 --> 00:52:16.842
I heard that you're a very capable priestess.

546
00:52:16.842 --> 00:52:21.642
Because you're so strong, I see that you're protecting Bu Ja from rotting anymore.

547
00:52:21.642 --> 00:52:24.202
Thank you. You're very amazing.

548
00:52:24.202 --> 00:52:27.782
If you find it so amazing, then do you want to switch?

549
00:52:28.572 --> 00:52:31.832
Your blood has the scent of lotus flowers.

550
00:52:31.832 --> 00:52:35.462
However, my blood has the scent of roses, which has always been stronger of the two.

551
00:52:35.462 --> 00:52:41.022
Lotus fragrance and rose fragrance. Do you want to switch them?

552
00:52:41.022 --> 00:52:45.512
There's something I learned to rub people the wrong way during times like this.

553
00:52:46.922 --> 00:52:51.262
I don't want to to. Why should I? How much will you give me?

554
00:52:51.262 --> 00:52:55.462
Even if you give me 500 won, I won't change with you.

555
00:52:55.462 --> 00:52:56.992
Where did you learn that from?

556
00:52:56.992 --> 00:53:02.122
Son Oh Gong. We're childish like that. Birds of a feather.

557
00:53:02.122 --> 00:53:06.492
So don't think of butting in the middle of a pair of two of a kind.

558
00:53:06.492 --> 00:53:13.082
And as for abilities, I'll have you know that both Bu Ja and you, Ah Sa Nyeo, woke up from my blood.

559
00:53:13.082 --> 00:53:15.942
My blood also has it's own decent power.

560
00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:20.412
So I've no thoughts of changing it.

561
00:53:25.232 --> 00:53:28.792
This is the censer that disappeared from the museum not long ago.

562
00:53:28.792 --> 00:53:34.692
This censer has the same dragon shape as the sarcophagus that you showed me.

563
00:53:39.462 --> 00:53:42.652
It really is the same.

564
00:53:46.822 --> 00:53:51.082
This is the woman that was caught on the CCTV camera when the censer disappeared.

565
00:53:52.452 --> 00:53:59.422
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by
The Monkey Minions @ Viki</i>

566
00:54:08.122 --> 00:54:12.462
Jung Se Ra. It's that girl.

567
00:54:12.462 --> 00:54:18.142
Like I thought, she didn't die and was still alive.

568
00:54:26.612 --> 00:54:31.062
Bu Ja! Bu Ja! I found your mother! She's in the hospital right now.

569
00:54:31.062 --> 00:54:35.362
Fortunately, she had someone to help her so she's being treated right now. Let's go!

570
00:54:37.062 --> 00:54:38.922
Ouch, my nose hurts...

571
00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:54.702
You really are Bu Ja!

572
00:54:55.762 --> 00:55:00.192
Have you any idea how scared I was thinking that you were really gone?

573
00:55:01.992 --> 00:55:04.272
What a relief.

574
00:55:04.272 --> 00:55:06.402
- I'm-
- Don't tell me you're not!

575
00:55:06.402 --> 00:55:09.512
I know that you're Ah Sa Nyeo. But Bu Ja's still in there, too.

576
00:55:09.512 --> 00:55:12.812
So don't speak like Bu Ja's gone.

577
00:55:17.872 --> 00:55:23.202
I'll go and meet your mother first by myself. Let's go together next time.

578
00:55:34.042 --> 00:55:38.842
Such a pain. I need to quickly change bodies and get rid of this Bu Ja girl's body.

579
00:55:47.862 --> 00:55:49.512
Today's the day.

580
00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:54.072
This is the last day of her ninth life.

581
00:55:54.072 --> 00:55:56.962
I'm all ready.

582
00:55:57.672 --> 00:56:01.882
I just need you to prepare one thing for me, Ma Wang.

583
00:56:03.162 --> 00:56:06.682
- What is it?
- Sam Jang's blood.

584
00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:13.432
Since this body isn't mine, the power of blood is weak.

585
00:56:13.432 --> 00:56:18.162
If I mix my blood with Sam Jang's it will be fine.

586
00:56:18.162 --> 00:56:22.832
Put Sam Jang's blood in this censer.

587
00:56:29.162 --> 00:56:34.782
<i>[CEO Jin Seon Mi]</i>

588
00:56:37.932 --> 00:56:41.922
Ma Wang, what brings you here?

589
00:56:44.562 --> 00:56:49.432
I came here like this because I have a favor to ask of you.

590
00:56:49.432 --> 00:56:55.682
Sam Jang, there's someone I need you to see by coming with me.

591
00:57:16.852 --> 00:57:19.232
So that's who that person is.

592
00:57:21.542 --> 00:57:23.662
Welcome.

593
00:57:30.772 --> 00:57:33.012
Are you looking for something?

594
00:57:34.932 --> 00:57:37.802
I'll just take a look around.

595
00:58:10.312 --> 00:58:15.842
There was a deceased soul next to her. Is she going to die today?

596
00:58:15.842 --> 00:58:22.802
That's right. She lives the same length of a life for every life and then dies.

597
00:58:22.802 --> 00:58:29.472
Today is the last day of her ninth life.

598
00:58:33.652 --> 00:58:39.492
Then do you want me to rid of that deceased soul to prevent her from dying?

599
00:58:39.492 --> 00:58:42.562
It's not possible to get rid of a deceased soul.

600
00:58:42.562 --> 00:58:48.752
I know. She's going to die today. That's not something we can prevent.

601
00:58:48.752 --> 00:58:55.642
But I've found a method for being able to end her eternal painful cycle of death and rebirth with the end of this reincarnation.

602
00:58:55.642 --> 00:58:57.732
I heard that's something very dangerous for you.

603
00:58:57.732 --> 00:59:02.082
I have to do it. Please help me, Sam Jang.

604
00:59:02.082 --> 00:59:04.162
What do you need me to do?

605
00:59:04.162 --> 00:59:09.702
I need your blood.

606
00:59:18.542 --> 00:59:25.072
General Winter, I'm going to be able to mix my blood with Sam Jang's soon.

607
00:59:25.072 --> 00:59:29.212
Once I go into Sam Jang's body, I'll become far more stronger than I was in the past.

608
00:59:29.212 --> 00:59:32.212
What are you going to do with Son Oh Gong?

609
00:59:32.212 --> 00:59:37.072
I'm going to take over that woman's body and marry him.

610
00:59:38.482 --> 00:59:40.832
A priestess can manipulate the stars?

611
00:59:40.832 --> 00:59:46.012
Yes, it is said that she can read people's destinies.

612
00:59:46.012 --> 00:59:50.452
It is possible if she collects the destinies that will be given to Priestess Iron Fan,

613
00:59:55.252 --> 00:59:58.242
So her deal with Ma Wang wasn't a lie after all.

614
00:59:58.242 --> 01:00:02.312
She can also manipulate souls.
- Yeah.

615
01:00:02.312 --> 01:00:04.032
She bragged about that to me herself.

616
01:00:04.032 --> 01:00:09.362
She's capable of transferring a soul to somewhere else.

617
01:00:11.712 --> 01:00:13.932
Transferring a soul?

618
01:00:13.932 --> 01:00:20.132
Yes. It's possible for her to do so by mixing blood.

619
01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:31.742
The number of remaining painful reincarnations for Princess Iron Fan is 99 times...

620
01:00:31.742 --> 01:00:37.722
So am I supposed to be hit with the evil energy of the remaining 99 reincarnations?

621
01:00:37.722 --> 01:00:42.382
Yes, I will bring forth the energies from the stars.

622
01:00:43.332 --> 01:00:47.482
The energy of the stars will fall upon you like arrows.

623
01:00:47.482 --> 01:00:52.872
You, Ma Wang, are to be hit with that evil energy.

624
01:00:57.392 --> 01:01:01.452
First, we need to prepare the censer.

625
01:01:01.452 --> 01:01:04.252
Please give me Sam Jang's blood.

626
01:01:37.262 --> 01:01:41.122
Now, I will mix in my own blood.

627
01:01:57.992 --> 01:02:00.472
Nice catch.

628
01:02:01.432 --> 01:02:03.792
Why are you doing this?

629
01:02:07.062 --> 01:02:10.212
What are you doing? Didn't I tell you not to come mess around?

630
01:02:10.212 --> 01:02:12.762
I think she's acting weird.

631
01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:16.802
Why does your blood need to be mixed in? Your blood has no power right now.

632
01:02:18.052 --> 01:02:20.932
If you block me like this, I can't do anything.

633
01:02:20.932 --> 01:02:23.862
We don't need you here. Get out.

634
01:02:29.492 --> 01:02:34.082
Leave this here. Sam Jang's blood is already on it.

635
01:02:49.052 --> 01:02:51.752
What are you doing right now? I told you not to come mess around.

636
01:02:51.752 --> 01:02:53.752
I'm not messing around. Continue.

637
01:02:53.752 --> 01:02:55.412
You made the priestess leave!

638
01:02:55.412 --> 01:02:57.902
Sam Jang can do it.

639
01:02:59.762 --> 01:03:03.222
- What?
- Me?

640
01:03:03.222 --> 01:03:06.402
- i can't do it.
- You can.

641
01:03:06.402 --> 01:03:09.482
Elder Soo Bo Ri said you can do it too.

642
01:03:09.482 --> 01:03:15.002
Sam Jang is a more powerful priestess than Ah Sa Nyeo. You can do it.

643
01:03:17.072 --> 01:03:20.782
Fine, then call Elder Soo Bo Ri here to confirm.

644
01:03:20.782 --> 01:03:24.382
He went to go get someone, he'll be here soon.

645
01:03:50.782 --> 01:03:52.642
Wait!

646
01:04:04.962 --> 01:04:07.382
Back off for now.

647
01:04:07.382 --> 01:04:10.872
I am Elder Soo Bo Ri.

648
01:04:10.872 --> 01:04:15.762
I should be able to postpone it for a few hours with my power.

649
01:04:20.952 --> 01:04:23.932
Seo Yoon Hee, stop what you're doing.

650
01:04:23.932 --> 01:04:27.402
Come meet someone with me for a second.

651
01:04:27.402 --> 01:04:30.022
Mind your own business and move aside.

652
01:04:30.022 --> 01:04:35.322
Someone is about to take on 10,000 years of pain for you.

653
01:04:35.322 --> 01:04:42.252
For that person, just 10 minutes... Can you give 10 minutes of your time for that person?

was told I needed to meet you.

Who are you?

You are Sam Jang.

You're the most special human being.
