2
00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:18.735
It's snowing!

3
00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:21.954
We talked about it before.

4
00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:26.008
- We said we wanted to feed them well this time.
- You're right.

5
00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:30.344
- We want them to eat well and rest well.
- Those are our two goals.

6
00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:34.039
We are waiting for you with much curiosity.

7
00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:35.837
Who are you?

8
00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:38.212
Hello!

9
00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.985
Oh, it's you, Yoon-ah! Oh, my!

10
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.985
- Do you know how to drive?
- Yes.

11
00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:44.930
Are you good at cooking?

12
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.750
Yes!

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.906
Yoon-ah is very good at cleaning. She knows how to change the vacuum, too.

14
00:00:54.664 --> 00:00:58.024
(However, there is a time when Yoon-ah is nervous, too.)

15
00:00:58.407 --> 00:01:00.016
- Hyo-ri, get it ready.
- Okay.

16
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.305
(Yoon-ah is stuck between Hyo-ri and Sang-soon.

17
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.656
"She's passionate and feisty.

18
00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:05.961
She sacrifices herself for others."

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.794
(What does Yoon-ah need at this time? A call from a customer.)

20
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:12.819
- They called.
- Hello?

21
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.021
Really?

22
00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.801
- Will we be able to lift Matisse?
- Of course.

23
00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.442
Someone lifted Damas before.

24
00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.973
(Who are the first guests?)

25
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.348
Hold on. Don't move. It's tight!

26
00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:36.325
(They arrived at Hyo-ri's Bed and Breakfast!)

27
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:37.950
- Are they here?
- Yes.

28
00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:40.108
(Ding-dong! Guests are here!)

29
00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.505
Who is it?

30
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.450
- Hello.
- They're here!

31
00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.106
- You arrived?
- Yes.

32
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:52.856
- Come on in. I'll open the gate for you.
- Okay.

33
00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:55.450
The front gate will open now, right?

34
00:01:56.382 --> 00:02:00.145
(The front gate that greets the first guests open.)

35
00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.083
- Make sure not to harm the house.
- Or the car.

36
00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:04.607
No, the house!

37
00:02:06.372 --> 00:02:08.114
Wow, it's enormous!

38
00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.403
Why aren't the dogs coming out to greet us?

39
00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.614
- I know.
- Maybe they're inside because it's cold.

40
00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:20.692
Wow! We're here!

41
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:29.590
(Is this a dream... or is this real...?)

42
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.645
(Lee Sang-soon is the one who made them scream.)

43
00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:37.184
- Hello!
- Hello.

44
00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:42.098
Turn it to the right.

45
00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:45.958
- Isn't his voice totally gentle?
- Totally low.

46
00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:48.145
Hey. Hey.

47
00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:52.637
- Who said he was ugly?
- Hey, you can't say such things here.

48
00:02:52.662 --> 00:02:53.825
Thank you.

49
00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:01.434
I can't open my eyes.

50
00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:07.739
(Welcome to Hyo-ri's Bed and Breakfast!)

51
00:03:09.427 --> 00:03:11.094
Seems like a family came.

52
00:03:11.528 --> 00:03:12.528
- A family?

53
00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:14.504
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they're friends.

54
00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.020
Are they?

55
00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.809
- Go.
- Whoa, she's beautiful!

56
00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:23.834
She's really pretty!

57
00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:27.700
- Hello!
- She's super pretty!

58
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:32.512
They said I'm pretty. It's because they saw me from afar.

59
00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:35.012
- You need to be 100 meters away from me.
- That's not true.

60
00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:40.044
- Your suitcase must be very heavy.
- It's fine.

61
00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:44.465
- Hi!
- Hello!

62
00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.606
- No, Guana.
- Hi, Soonshim.

63
00:03:47.732 --> 00:03:50.169
- All right. First, the suitcase...
- Move it over there.

64
00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:51.739
Cute.

65
00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:54.723
- Hello.
- Hi.

66
00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:58.004
- First off, take a seat here.
- I can't believe this.

67
00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:01.309
(They discover Yoon-ah.)

68
00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:06.114
Hello.

69
00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:09.270
- Hello.
- Hello.

70
00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:12.067
Stop.

71
00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:19.161
(Uneasy)

72
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.809
(What do I do first...?)

73
00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:30.208
- This is Hyo-ri.
- Hello!

74
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.028
That's Im Yoon-ah, our new employee.

75
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.637
- I'm Sang-soon.
- It's nice to meet you.

76
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.325
- You guys are our first guests.
- I know.

77
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.483
- Friends?
- Yes.

78
00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:48.379
Really? I thought you were a family, since you guys look alike.

79
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.129
- We're judo players.
- You guys are?

80
00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.715
- Just you two?
- No, all of us.

81
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.551
- Really?
- We're a judo training group.

82
00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:00.481
No wonder you have good physiques.

83
00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:04.278
- What are your names?
- Say it one by one.

84
00:05:04.653 --> 00:05:06.590
- I'm Bae Hye-bin.
- Hye-bin.

85
00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:09.419
- I'm Choi Eun-hyun.
- Eun-hyun.

86
00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:11.794
- I'm Lee Jae-ran.
- Jae-ran.

87
00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:14.028
- I'm Jung Ye-rin.
- Ye-rin.

88
00:05:14.053 --> 00:05:15.512
I'm Kim Ye-sol.

89
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.325
- Our names are pretty, huh?
- You guys have pretty names!

90
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.731
Then how long are you guys planning to stay?

91
00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:27.395
- Three days and two nights.
- Really?

92
00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:29.778
Have you ever come to Jeju in the winter?

93
00:05:30.107 --> 00:05:34.153
- We hold competitions here in December every year.
- Really?

94
00:05:34.178 --> 00:05:37.387
We only came here for the competitions. It's our first time coming for vacation.

95
00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:41.028
- Then did you guys already decide where you want to go?
- Yes.

96
00:05:42.732 --> 00:05:46.356
- Camellia Hill.
- You wanted to walk around.

97
00:05:46.872 --> 00:05:48.465
We want to go eat, too.

98
00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:53.208
- We don't have to introduce the house, right?
- Yes.

99
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:59.044
But we have something new. Did you see the white round tent outside?

100
00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.622
That's a yurt, a Mongolian tent.

101
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.442
It's cold, so you guys can have a campfire in there.

102
00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:08.150
If you want to play even more after bedtime, you

103
00:06:08.176 --> 00:06:10.763
can go over there. It's warm because of the stove.

104
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:12.497
You can play over there.

105
00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:18.136
There's an open-air tub behind the house.

106
00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:24.215
- We should've brought clothes for that.
- We already did.

107
00:06:24.497 --> 00:06:26.122
What if they don't fit us...?

108
00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:30.286
I'll get sizes that fit for you no matter what.

109
00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:37.190
So if you want to use it, tell us beforehand. It takes one to two hours to fill it.

110
00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:42.012
So if you tell us beforehand, we'll fill it up.

111
00:06:42.528 --> 00:06:45.450
It's very nice to go in there when it's snowing.

112
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.606
- It will make your tiredness go away.
- Yes.

113
00:06:48.177 --> 00:06:51.754
There are five of you, so I think you girls can use the second floor.

114
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:55.358
Would you like cold or hot drinks?

115
00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.583
- Cold drinks.
- Cold? Okay.

116
00:06:57.794 --> 00:06:59.527
Let's peel the tangerines.

117
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:04.840
I think some of you want something warm to drink... no?

118
00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:08.387
- Tell me confidently. None of you?
- I do.

119
00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:11.153
Right?

120
00:07:12.726 --> 00:07:13.926
I said it for you.

121
00:07:13.951 --> 00:07:15.661
- Warm drink for one of you?
- Yes.

122
00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:19.637
- Okay.
- I'll make the citrus tea. You bring the tangerines.

123
00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.895
You just have to bring a bunch of them.

124
00:07:23.848 --> 00:07:26.590
(The tangerines are here.)

125
00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:33.169
(Yesterday, the three of them picked these tangerines.)

126
00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:37.231
(They will be used as welcome drinks.)

127
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.395
- Here's your tea.
- Thank you.

128
00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:49.911
It's winter, so this time, we want our guests

129
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:55.287
to eat and sleep well.

130
00:07:57.038 --> 00:07:58.319
Did you eat lunch?

131
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:01.741
We're going to eat now.

132
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:06.123
- There's a pork cutlet restaurant nearby.
- Is it open now? Ask, just in case.

133
00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:09.678
Then let's definitely eat there.

134
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.741
- I'll ask.
- You need to eat. How can you go around being hungry?

135
00:08:15.502 --> 00:08:19.217
(Hyo-ri and Yoon-ah make tangerine juice.)

136
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.069
(Fresh tangerines go into the blender.)

137
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.498
- Here's your juice.
- Thank you.

138
00:08:34.655 --> 00:08:36.436
- Each of you take a glass.
- Juice.

139
00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:41.334
- Yoon-ah is passing out the welcome drinks.
- Thank you.

140
00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:43.007
Drink slowly.

141
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.959
It's cold outside, so if you have nowhere else to go, don't just wander outside.

142
00:08:50.382 --> 00:08:52.561
- Don't torture yourself.
- Come in whenever you want.

143
00:08:53.577 --> 00:08:58.655
- The pork cutlet restaurant can take five people right now.
- Hurry and go.

144
00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:02.592
- Hurry up and go.
- It could rain, I mean snow.

145
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:04.444
- Okay.
- Be careful.

146
00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:06.608
- We'll be back.
- Your shoes are over there.

147
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:09.264
- Our shoes are over there.
- See you later.

148
00:09:10.726 --> 00:09:15.647
- If it feels like the snow is going to pile up, hurry up and come back.
- Okay.

149
00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:19.397
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

150
00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.772
Slowly. Drive safely.

151
00:09:27.632 --> 00:09:30.655
Completely turn the car that way.

152
00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:33.303
Good job. Just like that.

153
00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:37.600
- We'll be back.
- Bye. Have fun.

154
00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:41.733
- Should we turn on the navigation?
- Turn it on.

155
00:09:41.944 --> 00:09:45.147
- The pork cutlet restaurant?
- The address is here.

156
00:09:46.874 --> 00:09:51.702
- I was shocked after seeing Hyo-ri in the window.
- I thought it was a photo shoot.

157
00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:53.425
I was surprised.

158
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:57.108
(Hyo-ri's daily life seems like a photo shoot.)

159
00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:01.842
Do I have to call Yoon-ah a goddess? Her face is so small, and her skin is white.

160
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.264
She's the size of our arms!

161
00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:11.905
(White and slender Yoon-ah)

162
00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:22.405
Sang-soon, I'll take the dogs.

163
00:10:23.233 --> 00:10:25.983
Then I'll go to the market.

164
00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:31.467
Hold on. We can write down what we need to buy on the way, right?

165
00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:32.991
I'll write it down.

166
00:10:33.288 --> 00:10:34.514
- Do you want to?
- Yes.

167
00:10:35.077 --> 00:10:36.498
Do we need anything else, Hyo-ri?

168
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:40.342
- Abalone.
- Abalone.

169
00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:42.626
- Rice.
- White rice.

170
00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.335
- Maybe ramen, just in case.
- Ramen.

171
00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:51.178
- Shoes. Slippers.
- Yes, that's all for now.

172
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:53.491
Go on.

173
00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:56.170
Go with the concept of a go game.

174
00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:00.374
We'll be back.

175
00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:05.389
- Bye.
- Bye.

176
00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:13.959
(Gosil is in the front yard.)

177
00:11:15.428 --> 00:11:16.428
Gosil.

178
00:11:19.624 --> 00:11:21.053
Does Gosil only stay outside?

179
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.225
- Does he like being outside?
- He does whatever he wants.

180
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:29.319
He comes in if he wants to, but if he's scared, he'll stay outside.

181
00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:35.686
When he comes in, he really likes us, but when we tell him to come in, he won't.

182
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:45.483
(The inside of the car is silent.)

183
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:51.663
(I need to say something...)

184
00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:53.311
While doing this...

185
00:11:55.655 --> 00:11:56.920
halfway through...

186
00:11:58.288 --> 00:12:00.694
then it really seems like a guesthouse.

187
00:12:01.358 --> 00:12:07.858
The guests naturally get closer together, and they hang out with each other.

188
00:12:09.647 --> 00:12:11.295
- It seems fun.
- It is.

189
00:12:13.873 --> 00:12:16.381
(End of conversation)

190
00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:20.272
Guana!

191
00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:27.327
Guana, come here. Good boy.

192
00:12:29.788 --> 00:12:36.327
Mocha, come here. Good. Let's go.

193
00:12:36.897 --> 00:12:40.584
Let's go. Let's go, Mocha. Let's go.

194
00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:46.733
Come here. Your leash is too tight.

195
00:12:47.468 --> 00:12:49.897
Oh, dear. You almost died.

196
00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:52.327
Come here. Okay.

197
00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:54.639
Slow down.

198
00:12:55.522 --> 00:12:59.498
Let's go. Slowly. Soonshim, come here.

199
00:13:01.038 --> 00:13:03.069
It's really difficult walking you guys by myself.

200
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:08.827
Good.

201
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.014
Let's go. Sniff around. Smells good, huh?

202
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:21.561
Let's go.

203
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:32.428
(This is the place where she came with Sang-soon last summer.)

204
00:13:37.319 --> 00:13:38.889
- Is that the smell of lilac?
- Yes.

205
00:13:40.913 --> 00:13:41.913
How nice.

206
00:13:44.877 --> 00:13:50.663
(Winter came with white snow.)

207
00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:57.413
("Snowman"
- Jung Seung-hwan)

208
00:14:20.015 --> 00:14:21.498
I should've come with Sang-soon.

209
00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:23.172
It's really tiring.

210
00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:29.819
Let's go.

211
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:38.209
Let's run! Let's run!

212
00:14:39.522 --> 00:14:40.522
Run! Run! Run!

213
00:14:41.108 --> 00:14:43.991
For 50 of them, they will be $3 each!

214
00:14:44.996 --> 00:14:47.100
(Sang-soon and Yoon-ah came to the mart.)

215
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:49.053
The abalone is over there.

216
00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.748
We can get this one.

217
00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.936
- White rice and ramen.
- Ramen?

218
00:14:56.093 --> 00:14:57.093
Ramen.

219
00:14:59.585 --> 00:15:00.585
Rice.

220
00:15:01.663 --> 00:15:03.014
And slippers.

221
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.163
This is for our precious guests.

222
00:15:09.186 --> 00:15:11.952
- Hyo-ri needs bobby pins.
- Bobby pins?

223
00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:17.420
(Tape)

224
00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:22.592
- Did you put tape on your hair?
- Because I have no bobby pins.

225
00:15:25.015 --> 00:15:26.015
My bangs...

226
00:15:27.223 --> 00:15:29.756
(Employee Yoon-ah has understood what Hyo-ri needs.)

227
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.725
Bobby pins... Something Ike this is cute, too.

228
00:15:34.608 --> 00:15:36.850
It's something for the bangs...

229
00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:38.781
We'll get this one.

230
00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:45.694
We would like to buy some slippers.

231
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.233
- We have them in 30 and 50.
- Yes.

232
00:15:51.718 --> 00:15:54.592
(Done with their deeds.)

233
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:57.420
There's a place here that sells really good kimbap.

234
00:15:58.772 --> 00:16:00.014
We can't buy them, right?

235
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.100
Let's eat it next time.

236
00:16:06.436 --> 00:16:07.678
Should we just try a roll?

237
00:16:08.874 --> 00:16:10.334
We'll get in trouble, won't we?

238
00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:13.514
I should ask Hyo-ri.

239
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:19.795
Mocha, come here. Soonshim, what's that?

240
00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:23.303
How cute. It looks like Styrofoam balls are on top of it.

241
00:16:24.186 --> 00:16:25.764
- Hey.
- Hey, Hyo-ri.

242
00:16:25.968 --> 00:16:27.248
Hey, Sang-soon.

243
00:16:28.015 --> 00:16:33.225
- Yoon-ah wants to try kimbap. Should we buy some?
- Kimbap?

244
00:16:33.765 --> 00:16:35.186
- Yeah.
- What about dinner?

245
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.913
- You're not going to eat it?
- This is just a snack.

246
00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:40.225
(Uneasy)

247
00:16:40.546 --> 00:16:43.834
Hurry up and come back. If you're going to eat it, you have to go there again.

248
00:16:44.077 --> 00:16:45.077
Okay.

249
00:16:48.796 --> 00:16:50.178
Are you making the pancakes?

250
00:16:50.483 --> 00:16:51.750
- What?
- Pancakes.

251
00:16:52.733 --> 00:16:54.561
Hang up! It's chaotic over here!

252
00:16:55.358 --> 00:16:56.492
- Why?
- Hang up!

253
00:16:57.374 --> 00:16:59.553
Talk with me. Hey.

254
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.717
Hey, Mocha, come here. Hang up!

255
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.702
Gosh, there's a pandemonium here.

256
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.780
Slow down! Go slowly!

257
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:13.452
Mocha, it's cold. Come here. I'll hold you.

258
00:17:14.257 --> 00:17:17.053
Let's go.

259
00:17:18.101 --> 00:17:19.101
It's cold.

260
00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:22.459
See? It's torture to leave home when it's cold, right?

261
00:17:23.257 --> 00:17:26.413
How nice would it be to just sit in front of the fireplace on a cold day?

262
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.655
Let's not go out tomorrow. How about it?

263
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.097
Let's go, Guana.

264
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.248
(Sang-soon & Yoon-ah returned!)

265
00:17:40.835 --> 00:17:43.741
(Gosil came to greet them.)

266
00:17:46.522 --> 00:17:51.139
- Can you hold all of this?
- I think so... I'll do this..."

267
00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.452
Gosil.

268
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.670
The atmosphere.

269
00:18:10.343 --> 00:18:12.217
Soonyi must be warm.

270
00:18:16.272 --> 00:18:17.272
Goodness.

271
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.655
(Hyo-ri came back.)

272
00:18:25.823 --> 00:18:29.866
(They didn't unpack yet.)

273
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.670
I'm never walking them on my own again.

274
00:18:43.304 --> 00:18:45.373
It was pandemonium. What's all this?

275
00:18:45.905 --> 00:18:47.545
Why did you buy so many slippers?

276
00:18:48.429 --> 00:18:51.709
We need this much. Five for guys and five for girls.

277
00:18:52.968 --> 00:18:55.092
We need to take off the plastic and put them outside.

278
00:18:56.483 --> 00:18:58.194
Midal, where did you go?

279
00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:01.913
I'm curious.

280
00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:08.457
(She's organizing the open-air tub clothes.)

281
00:19:09.614 --> 00:19:11.522
(Outdoor slippers)

282
00:19:12.265 --> 00:19:14.709
- Do these slippers need to be taken to the yurt?
- Yes.

283
00:19:15.585 --> 00:19:17.686
I can just leave these outside, right?

284
00:19:18.748 --> 00:19:21.748
- It was so windy.
- Where did you go?

285
00:19:22.811 --> 00:19:24.623
I bet it was super windy over there.

286
00:19:25.655 --> 00:19:29.248
- You're going there alone tomorrow anyways, so I sacrificed myself today.
- What?

287
00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:33.834
- You're going there alone tomorrow, so I went there today.
- What did you say?

288
00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:36.053
Gosh. Don't pretend you didn't hear me.

289
00:19:36.078 --> 00:19:38.733
- What?
- Don't pretend you didn't hear me.

290
00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:40.359
What did you say?

291
00:19:44.054 --> 00:19:45.819
"You're going there alone tomorrow."

292
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.530
- What?
- That's what she said.

293
00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:50.555
What?

294
00:19:57.382 --> 00:19:58.382
Hey, guys.

295
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:10.158
Should I place them here?

296
00:20:19.382 --> 00:20:22.170
(The yurt is open for business.)

297
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.100
Then where should we place the spa clothes?

298
00:20:25.522 --> 00:20:30.030
- In the bathroom.
- Or there's the dressing room outside.

299
00:20:30.592 --> 00:20:33.311
- You can't carry them, right? Give me some.
- It's fine. I got it.

300
00:20:33.336 --> 00:20:35.702
- I'll carry them for you.
- I'm good.

301
00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.241
Very good.

302
00:20:38.577 --> 00:20:39.577
Pass!

303
00:20:40.397 --> 00:20:42.592
- What if she fails?
- Thank you.

304
00:20:43.865 --> 00:20:46.741
- What are you going to do?
- There's a dressing room?

305
00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:49.092
I made a temporary room over there.

306
00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:53.459
(The storage room will be used as a dressing room for now.)

307
00:20:55.012 --> 00:20:57.741
(Open-air tub is ready for business.)

308
00:20:57.766 --> 00:20:58.766
What's this?

309
00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:00.733
Oh, you bought bobby pins.

310
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.061
- Thanks for these, Yoon-ah.
- No problem.

311
00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:16.733
Why does my forehead get bigger as I age?

312
00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:21.084
Oh, well.

313
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.944
(Meanwhile, what are the judo players up to?)

314
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.248
(They're at the pork cutlet restaurant that Sang-soon recommended.)

315
00:21:34.358 --> 00:21:35.358
What's this?

316
00:21:36.804 --> 00:21:38.553
Sirloin and tenderloin.

317
00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:43.225
Looks really good.

318
00:21:44.225 --> 00:21:46.295
- Thank you for the food.
- Shrimp!

319
00:21:47.085 --> 00:21:48.085
What's that?

320
00:21:49.257 --> 00:21:50.257
Sirloin?

321
00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:52.241
It's very good.

322
00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:55.944
(They nicely mix up the salad udon.)

323
00:22:05.311 --> 00:22:07.498
This is seriously good. It's totally my style.

324
00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:15.709
(They head to the arboretum.)

325
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:29.311
(In the winter, the place is filled with the smell of camellia flowers.)

326
00:22:31.647 --> 00:22:34.311
- Wow, it's super pretty.
- We have to take photos here!

327
00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:35.850
We must take pictures.

328
00:22:36.593 --> 00:22:39.592
That's it. It's windy, so you have to take it quickly.

329
00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:43.592
- Where? In the center?
- Come in the center.

330
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.241
Here I go. Hurry up and pose. We have three seconds.

331
00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:48.842
- Come in the front.
- Run.

332
00:22:49.483 --> 00:22:50.550
One, two, three.

333
00:22:52.199 --> 00:22:55.202
(We came on a trip to Jeju. jpg)

334
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.514
- Want to take one here, too?
- There's this place, too. Come here.

335
00:22:58.671 --> 00:22:59.671
Don't run!

336
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.209
Hey, run when it's morning exercise time.

337
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.452
She's running better than then.

338
00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:06.719
Right here.

339
00:23:08.296 --> 00:23:10.959
- It's warm.
- Should we film a video, too?

340
00:23:11.193 --> 00:23:12.873
- Here I go.
- Bye.

341
00:23:12.898 --> 00:23:15.827
Let's pretend we're close even though we're not.

342
00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:27.881
I'm so happy. I'm so happy right now. Everyone should exercise at this time.

343
00:23:29.726 --> 00:23:31.834
It's snowing. You guys, it's snowing.

344
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:33.905
It's snowing! It's raining, too!

345
00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:37.397
- Wow, what's this?
- This is hail.

346
00:23:37.718 --> 00:23:40.600
What's this? Do you all have hoods? I'm the only one without one!

347
00:23:45.147 --> 00:23:46.428
This is enough. Let's go.

348
00:23:50.772 --> 00:23:52.366
So noisy. So noisy!

349
00:23:54.093 --> 00:23:55.093
It's so noisy!

350
00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.061
(The culprit is this guy.)

351
00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:02.153
This is awesome.

352
00:24:03.124 --> 00:24:05.272
It's totally different listening to the LP version.

353
00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:09.413
That seems like an exclusive dance.

354
00:24:09.438 --> 00:24:13.038
Everyone in German clubs dance like this.

355
00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:16.288
- Right, Hyo-ri?
- It's so noisy.

356
00:24:16.313 --> 00:24:17.944
They dance with their hands in fists?

357
00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:22.413
(He has a wife with a lot of energy, too.)

358
00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:26.452
(In a trance)

359
00:24:27.874 --> 00:24:29.381
The water is boiling, Sang-soon.

360
00:24:31.093 --> 00:24:32.413
I can't do this here.

361
00:24:33.788 --> 00:24:36.092
This is a music that is unfit for a bed and breakfast.

362
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.311
- I have to practice.
- Huh?

363
00:24:40.343 --> 00:24:42.186
I have to practice.

364
00:24:46.444 --> 00:24:47.756
Yoon-ah, do you want to draw?

365
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:54.186
- You drew these?
- Yes.

366
00:24:54.811 --> 00:24:57.475
- Let me see.
- I mostly draw dogs.

367
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.108
I don't draw people.

368
00:25:04.647 --> 00:25:06.944
- What's this?
- Crayons.

369
00:25:07.976 --> 00:25:08.976
This is Samsik.

370
00:25:13.765 --> 00:25:15.298
It looks just like him.

371
00:25:16.873 --> 00:25:24.577
This is Soonshim, Mocha, Seoksam, Guana, Gosil, and Midal.

372
00:25:25.866 --> 00:25:26.866
Soonshim!

373
00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:29.764
He was a bundle of fur.

374
00:25:31.069 --> 00:25:33.044
It doesn't matter if you draw well or not. You

375
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.960
just need to draw like an elementary student.

376
00:25:35.515 --> 00:25:40.631
- You draw very well, Hyo-ri.
- If you go to shelters, you see a lot of these scenes.

377
00:25:54.371 --> 00:25:58.123
(Today, they drink a cup of tea, too.)

378
00:26:01.021 --> 00:26:04.811
(With a song that Sang-soon picked...)

379
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:31.983
Did you learn art?

380
00:26:32.686 --> 00:26:35.545
I learned a little bit when I was in high school.

381
00:26:38.171 --> 00:26:39.904
It wasn't fun learning it.

382
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:43.131
- Plaster cast.
- Agrippa.

383
00:26:43.585 --> 00:26:49.530
It was so boring, and I couldn't finish it out.

384
00:26:50.155 --> 00:26:51.686
So I quit.

385
00:26:54.232 --> 00:27:00.155
It would've been fun if they had let me draw what I wanted to.

386
00:27:01.624 --> 00:27:05.553
Even now, I can't draw things I don't want to draw.

387
00:27:06.507 --> 00:27:07.507
I really can't.

388
00:27:08.506 --> 00:27:12.952
But I like animals, so I can draw them.

389
00:27:18.499 --> 00:27:20.616
Just draw.

390
00:27:24.663 --> 00:27:25.663
Draw...

391
00:27:29.663 --> 00:27:32.577
(Hesitate)

392
00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:08.264
(The day in the bed and breakfast is quietly coming to an end.)

393
00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:16.405
What are you drawing?

394
00:28:16.811 --> 00:28:17.811
This tea cup?

395
00:28:18.411 --> 00:28:21.872
It's cute. You draw pretty well.

396
00:28:22.459 --> 00:28:24.060
- It's cute.
- It's nice.

397
00:28:25.982 --> 00:28:27.915
I can't draw the circle well.

398
00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:32.005
If you want to draw it exactly like this, you can just take a picture of it instead.

399
00:28:32.545 --> 00:28:35.396
So just draw it however you want to.

400
00:28:40.357 --> 00:28:41.357
It's cute.

401
00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:52.201
Is it raining?

402
00:28:54.184 --> 00:28:55.184
Is it?

403
00:28:55.209 --> 00:28:58.310
(Unpredictable Jeju weather)

404
00:28:58.335 --> 00:28:59.911
It must have rained a bit.

405
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.419
- I should go practice then.
- Practice what?

406
00:29:04.998 --> 00:29:05.998
DJing.

407
00:29:12.404 --> 00:29:14.435
I think Sang-soon is very comfortable with you.

408
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:17.380
- Really?
- Yes. He's usually shy to strangers.

409
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.130
I'm glad.

410
00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:21.480
He only saw you for a couple days.

411
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:24.700
He would usually never offer to go to the mart with someone.

412
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:28.857
I saw you a few times,

413
00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:31.278
but I met him for the first time.

414
00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:36.075
But I feel comfortable with him like I saw him a few times, too.

415
00:29:38.429 --> 00:29:43.763
(I am... a comfortable man...)

416
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:47.505
(DJ Soon's practice/-The End-)

417
00:29:48.326 --> 00:29:50.659
(Yoon-ah is done with her drawing.)

418
00:29:51.646 --> 00:29:55.200
Now write something sentimental on there.

419
00:30:06.998 --> 00:30:08.255
Something like this.

420
00:30:16.032 --> 00:30:20.224
(Don't buy. Adopt./Soonshim)

421
00:30:20.654 --> 00:30:22.880
(Thinking hard)

422
00:30:24.685 --> 00:30:25.864
Did you think of it?

423
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.060
I'm organizing my thoughts.

424
00:30:29.724 --> 00:30:30.724
Just...

425
00:30:31.771 --> 00:30:33.216
(Glance)

426
00:30:34.013 --> 00:30:36.833
My hands and feet are already curling up!

427
00:30:36.858 --> 00:30:37.858
"Warm tea..."

428
00:30:39.576 --> 00:30:44.622
- One more. I really want to write this as the most cringe-worthy line.
- What?

429
00:30:48.904 --> 00:30:50.304
Hurry up and show me.

430
00:30:51.123 --> 00:30:54.802
- Let me see. It has to be short and impacting.
- It is.

431
00:30:54.827 --> 00:30:58.177
- What is it?
- It will make you cringe.

432
00:30:58.349 --> 00:30:59.349
Let me see.

433
00:31:00.427 --> 00:31:06.028
"Cold air. Warm tea. This winter... at Hyo-ri's cozy house."

434
00:31:06.619 --> 00:31:09.677
(Startled/Struggling)

435
00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:15.700
Hey!

436
00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:20.411
(Warm air, warm tea, and lonely DJ Soon)

437
00:31:21.774 --> 00:31:27.677
(This beat is the only thing that makes my heart race.)

438
00:31:29.404 --> 00:31:32.021
Do judo players drink alcohol, too?

439
00:31:32.927 --> 00:31:34.208
Won't they?

440
00:31:35.347 --> 00:31:38.547
(Hyo-ri and Yoon-ah are cleaning up the kitchen.)

441
00:31:39.465 --> 00:31:44.325
(She gets on her tippy toes while organizing the cups.)

442
00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:52.482
(She gets on her tippy toes while searching for flour.)

443
00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:56.572
(Uncomfortable like it's not her own house)

444
00:31:57.099 --> 00:31:58.560
Yoon-ah, take this out for me.

445
00:31:59.387 --> 00:32:01.054
- Which one?
- The flour.

446
00:32:01.716 --> 00:32:04.255
(Comfortable like it's her own house)

447
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.280
Thanks.

448
00:32:08.818 --> 00:32:10.841
You must cook often.

449
00:32:11.216 --> 00:32:13.903
There aren't many places that deliver or places to eat here.

450
00:32:14.138 --> 00:32:16.857
And both of us like to cook.

451
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:26.833
I'd like to live spending a lot of lovey-dovey time with my husband like you, too.

452
00:32:27.787 --> 00:32:30.794
Hey, if you're with your husband 24/7, you guys will get into fights.

453
00:32:32.123 --> 00:32:34.810
- Right.
- It depends what kind of person he is.

454
00:32:35.748 --> 00:32:38.091
- What did you say?
- Sang-soon, can you do this for me?

455
00:32:39.878 --> 00:32:42.607
(All of the workers at the bed and breakfast have gathered.)

456
00:32:42.632 --> 00:32:45.052
- Do you know how to make Mille-feuille nabe?
- I do.

457
00:32:46.975 --> 00:32:50.747
(1. Lay cabbage and perilla leaves on top of each other.)

458
00:32:51.517 --> 00:32:56.169
(2. Put thinly sliced meat on the vegetables./Meat prepared for Yoon-ah.)

459
00:32:57.722 --> 00:33:03.552
(3. Stack the meat and vegetables on top of each other and cut to edible slices.)

460
00:33:04.659 --> 00:33:07.857
(4. Put them in the pot in a floral shape.)

461
00:33:08.482 --> 00:33:09.549
Oh, it's pretty.

462
00:33:11.927 --> 00:33:15.185
(The Mille-feuille nabe is ready.)

463
00:33:15.811 --> 00:33:18.466
(No, something is missing.)

464
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.724
(Focused)

465
00:33:25.248 --> 00:33:27.075
(Right now, Yoon-ah is...)

466
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:31.630
(decorating with mushrooms.)

467
00:33:33.348 --> 00:33:36.427
- Complete.
- You know how do things like this, too?

468
00:33:41.584 --> 00:33:43.802
I've never seen such a thing before. You're amazing.

469
00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:46.732
What's wrong with your way of talking?

470
00:33:47.075 --> 00:33:51.286
- I do all kinds of things.
- "You're amazing."

471
00:33:52.619 --> 00:34:00.411
(5. Depending on your preferences, pour the broth in and boil it.)

472
00:34:03.664 --> 00:34:09.278
(6:30 p.m.: Employees' Dinner)

473
00:34:13.021 --> 00:34:15.911
- Goodness. My back hurts.
- Me, too.

474
00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.302
(A time when the day's exhaustion comes over them)

475
00:34:23.482 --> 00:34:24.864
Stop opening it.

476
00:34:27.693 --> 00:34:29.130
I'm curious.

477
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.130
Do you eat three meals a day?

478
00:34:34.474 --> 00:34:35.950
I don't usually eat breakfast.

479
00:34:36.865 --> 00:34:39.286
Then do you eat lunch, dinner, and late night snack?

480
00:34:40.216 --> 00:34:41.724
Yes, usually.

481
00:34:45.107 --> 00:34:47.232
- Hyo-ri, can I open it?
- No.

482
00:34:49.192 --> 00:34:51.599
(Hungry Sang-soon)

483
00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:52.949
(Glance)

484
00:34:53.271 --> 00:34:56.341
- Aren't those logs that are piled up really pretty?
- They are.

485
00:34:56.366 --> 00:34:57.366
Right?

486
00:34:57.668 --> 00:35:00.473
Long ones, round ones, short ones.

487
00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:02.208
Aren't human faces like that?

488
00:35:02.919 --> 00:35:05.982
(All I can think of right now is the nabe.)

489
00:35:06.513 --> 00:35:08.271
Those images fit with us.

490
00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:10.935
Big one. Dark one. Little one.

491
00:35:12.552 --> 00:35:14.130
Don't open it!

492
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:18.083
- Did the water boil?
- I poured water in it.

493
00:35:18.108 --> 00:35:19.108
You did?

494
00:35:19.133 --> 00:35:21.388
(Yoon-ah finds this situation very amusing.)

495
00:35:21.576 --> 00:35:23.699
(10 minutes later...)

496
00:35:23.724 --> 00:35:25.771
- You can open it now.
- Is the fire weak?

497
00:35:30.308 --> 00:35:33.247
(Mille-feuille nabe is complete.)

498
00:35:33.888 --> 00:35:34.888
Looks delicious.

499
00:35:37.147 --> 00:35:40.646
(Their dinner consists of abundant hot pot.)

500
00:35:41.084 --> 00:35:43.380
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

501
00:35:50.029 --> 00:35:51.029
It's good!

502
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:54.193
Good, right?

503
00:35:56.326 --> 00:35:59.060
- It's really good.
- It is.

504
00:36:00.396 --> 00:36:02.224
This is a very delicious dish.

505
00:36:04.138 --> 00:36:05.338
I'm charmed by it.

506
00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:13.005
(What does Yoon-ah think of it?)

507
00:36:14.529 --> 00:36:15.732
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

508
00:36:18.334 --> 00:36:19.739
You were shocked, huh?

509
00:36:22.825 --> 00:36:24.247
It's good like this, too.

510
00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:30.130
(Yoon-ah eats well.)

511
00:36:32.614 --> 00:36:36.028
- We should've drank soju.
- Oh, do you want to?

512
00:36:37.005 --> 00:36:39.028
- Isn't it too late?
- We can just have one glass.

513
00:36:39.053 --> 00:36:40.239
Okay, just one glass.

514
00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:42.560
(Happy smile)

515
00:36:48.662 --> 00:36:49.662
Thank you.

516
00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:53.599
Here.

517
00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.007
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

518
00:37:00.021 --> 00:37:01.021
It's sweet.

519
00:37:06.567 --> 00:37:07.989
Did you drink it in one shot?

520
00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:10.466
You're good at drinking.

521
00:37:10.491 --> 00:37:14.200
I always feel like I have to drink the first glass of soju in one shot.

522
00:37:14.826 --> 00:37:19.005
Hyo-ri, do you know this? "The first glass is one shot, right?"

523
00:37:20.451 --> 00:37:22.567
- Someone like you should do those things.
- No.

524
00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:27.739
"The first glass is one shot, right?"

525
00:37:29.427 --> 00:37:31.927
- Do you want to hit me?
- You look dirty.

526
00:37:32.365 --> 00:37:35.161
- I look dirty?
- What was that?

527
00:37:35.334 --> 00:37:36.864
Wasn't it kind of cute though?

528
00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:39.800
(I got a scratch in my heart...)

529
00:37:41.082 --> 00:37:45.247
- Do it again. - "The first glass is one shot, right?"

530
00:37:45.794 --> 00:37:47.567
(I like it if it makes you laugh.)

531
00:37:47.592 --> 00:37:50.466
Do you know why it looks dirty? Cause my mouth is full of food.

532
00:37:54.388 --> 00:37:57.560
(They focus on their meal again.)

533
00:37:58.006 --> 00:38:01.192
- It's best to eat hot food in the cold weather, right?
- Yes.

534
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.599
What are the players having for dinner?

535
00:38:08.396 --> 00:38:09.396
The players?

536
00:38:10.238 --> 00:38:13.107
(Endless refill of Jeju black pork)

537
00:38:18.268 --> 00:38:22.489
(The judo players are losing their souls...)

538
00:38:29.021 --> 00:38:30.732
Do you dip this in here?

539
00:38:33.409 --> 00:38:36.927
(She's about to rip off all her fingernails.)

540
00:38:38.865 --> 00:38:40.927
- Looks good.
- The meat looks really good.

541
00:38:40.952 --> 00:38:42.885
We keep eating the whole day.

542
00:38:43.231 --> 00:38:45.521
I forgot what we ate after seeing this.

543
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:47.903
- What did we eat again?
- Pork cutlet.

544
00:38:49.106 --> 00:38:51.583
- Let's try it. We won't die.
- Eat it, Hye-bin.

545
00:38:52.347 --> 00:38:55.286
(We can't hold it in. Let's just eat it!)

546
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.927
Look carefully and eat the cooked ones.

547
00:38:58.482 --> 00:39:01.427
If I eat the wrong thing, I'll have to be in the bathroom the whole day.

548
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:04.450
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

549
00:39:04.623 --> 00:39:05.623
Dip it in here.

550
00:39:08.701 --> 00:39:11.067
- Show this.
- Black pork.

551
00:39:11.818 --> 00:39:12.818
Endless refill.

552
00:39:15.498 --> 00:39:16.498
With green onion.

553
00:39:19.334 --> 00:39:20.334
Eat it.

554
00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:27.753
(After that, the meat was refilled for a long time,

555
00:39:27.778 --> 00:39:30.802
(and the owner of the restaurant asked this...)

556
00:39:31.903 --> 00:39:37.372
Do you love black pork that much or did you eat a lot on purpose?

557
00:39:37.397 --> 00:39:39.794
- We ate a lot?
- This is a lot?

558
00:39:40.505 --> 00:39:44.317
- How many servings did we eat?
- 17 to 18 servings...

559
00:39:49.115 --> 00:39:51.044
- They'll arrive at 9.
- 9?

560
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:52.069
Yeah.

561
00:39:56.935 --> 00:39:59.278
- Black pork!
- Of course.

562
00:39:59.536 --> 00:40:02.302
They went to a restaurant that gives endless refills of black pork.

563
00:40:03.193 --> 00:40:04.782
Is that restaurant that good?

564
00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:08.817
Or are they still eating now?

565
00:40:09.762 --> 00:40:11.646
(They're cute girls...)

566
00:40:20.716 --> 00:40:23.021
- That was a good dinner.
- It was.

567
00:40:23.123 --> 00:40:27.474
- Thank you for the food.
- It's time to eat dessert with milk and apple pie.

568
00:40:28.055 --> 00:40:30.655
(Sang-soon is in charge of the dishes.)

569
00:40:33.005 --> 00:40:35.575
(Yoon-ah is in charge of cleaning the table.)

570
00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:39.755
(Cleanly, brightly, and with confidence!)

571
00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:43.560
(Hyo-ri is getting firewood from the yard.)

572
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.380
Midal!

573
00:40:50.858 --> 00:40:53.325
(Yoon-ah is fascinated by everything.)

574
00:40:57.591 --> 00:40:59.083
This one burns well.

575
00:41:07.575 --> 00:41:08.974
Oh, it's very warm.

576
00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:17.302
- Want some milk?
- Yes.

577
00:41:18.716 --> 00:41:19.771
Oh, yeah.

578
00:41:20.184 --> 00:41:22.607
(Sweet dessert)

579
00:41:22.632 --> 00:41:24.021
Looks delicious!

580
00:41:36.873 --> 00:41:39.567
The three of us are eating the same amount.

581
00:41:40.057 --> 00:41:42.732
(If you eat deliciously, it's 0 calories!)

582
00:41:44.834 --> 00:41:46.083
- Sang-soon.
- Yeah?

583
00:41:47.013 --> 00:41:52.325
If the girls want to sleep upstairs, we don't have to clean that up.

584
00:41:53.123 --> 00:41:55.249
We can put the blankets down so that two of them

585
00:41:55.274 --> 00:41:57.443
sleep up and three of them sleep down.

586
00:41:57.606 --> 00:42:00.208
Then should we lay them out beforehand?

587
00:42:01.271 --> 00:42:03.193
Let's do that. We have 30 minutes left.

588
00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:06.216
There will be space for us to sleep, too.

589
00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:10.958
(The first opening of the topper mattress.)

590
00:42:17.341 --> 00:42:19.490
(Once the mattresses are down...)

591
00:42:20.268 --> 00:42:24.529
(the blankets will be put on there.)

592
00:42:27.131 --> 00:42:28.880
These blankets will be very warm.

593
00:42:29.685 --> 00:42:30.685
I know.

594
00:42:32.248 --> 00:42:35.263
(Yoon-ah organizes them.)

595
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.568
- Should we put the luggage upstairs?
- Should we?

596
00:42:45.154 --> 00:42:46.154
Are they heavy?

597
00:42:50.195 --> 00:42:53.091
(Special service of carrying the luggage upstairs.)

598
00:42:56.568 --> 00:42:57.997
I'm so sorry!

599
00:42:59.008 --> 00:43:00.529
(He stubbed his foot on the suitcase.)

600
00:43:01.068 --> 00:43:02.068
What happened?

601
00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.986
- Hyo-ri.
- What?

602
00:43:04.935 --> 00:43:06.919
Yoon-ah stubbed my foot!

603
00:43:07.645 --> 00:43:09.865
- I'm so sorry.
- She stubbed my foot.

604
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:11.521
You did that to my husband?

605
00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:14.591
Let me see. I'll make it feel better.

606
00:43:16.881 --> 00:43:18.326
Oh, your feet stinks!

607
00:43:21.193 --> 00:43:24.583
- My teeth are chattering!
- Me, too!

608
00:43:25.193 --> 00:43:26.341
Come here.

609
00:43:26.834 --> 00:43:29.263
- Did you have fun?
- Yes!

610
00:43:29.646 --> 00:43:30.646
We're back.

611
00:43:31.795 --> 00:43:35.076
- Go in wherever you want.
- That surprised me.

612
00:43:35.178 --> 00:43:36.311
Guana, come here.

613
00:43:36.724 --> 00:43:38.802
- Midal, you saw them earlier.
- Did you have fun?

614
00:43:38.827 --> 00:43:42.263
- Yes.
- It's freezing!

615
00:43:42.865 --> 00:43:45.115
- Right? Sit in front of here.
- The fireplace.

616
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.443
I should turn up the heat.

617
00:43:48.818 --> 00:43:50.085
You guys were cold.

618
00:43:51.426 --> 00:43:54.990
(He turns up the heat because the guests might be cold.)

619
00:43:59.068 --> 00:44:00.904
Are all of you going to shower tonight?

620
00:44:01.693 --> 00:44:04.560
- Yes.
- It will take a long time then.

621
00:44:05.068 --> 00:44:07.841
- It'd be nice if you guys took a bath.
- Yes, that'd be better.

622
00:44:08.529 --> 00:44:14.326
- The water takes two hours to fill up though.
- Yeah, it will be 11 then.

623
00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:17.349
- How about all of you guys take a bath in the morning?
- The morning?

624
00:44:17.374 --> 00:44:19.482
- Should we?
- We can just wash our faces tonight.

625
00:44:19.507 --> 00:44:24.435
We'll fill the tub in the morning, so just go in there as soon as you wake up.

626
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.521
- Right? You guys have to wash in the morning anyways.
- Yes.

627
00:44:28.357 --> 00:44:29.997
Let's rest. Let's change our clothes.

628
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.951
- Yoon-ah, you can go now.
- Since you're our first guests...

629
00:44:34.162 --> 00:44:36.591
- We spread the blankets.
- We even took your things up.

630
00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:39.615
- Thank you.
- Good night.

631
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.966
See you tomorrow.

632
00:44:41.356 --> 00:44:43.130
You should take Yoon-ah to her lodging.

633
00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.630
- It's really snowing.
- It is?

634
00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:48.833
- Yeah.
- It's snowing a lot!

635
00:44:50.256 --> 00:44:56.904
If everything gets frozen tomorrow, when can we drive out?

636
00:44:57.372 --> 00:44:58.372
I'm not sure.

637
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.310
If it keeps snowing, they won't be able to go out when they came here to play.

638
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:13.029
- I think three days and two nights will be very short.
- It is.

639
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:14.833
If they don't go out tomorrow...

640
00:45:19.903 --> 00:45:26.810
(The judo players start to wash up.)

641
00:45:28.006 --> 00:45:29.539
Sorry, this isn't food.

642
00:45:30.537 --> 00:45:31.943
They go crazy for food.

643
00:45:33.232 --> 00:45:39.779
(They put facial masks on.)

644
00:45:43.122 --> 00:45:44.927
- Want to go down?
- Let's go.

645

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

646
00:45:52.927 --> 00:45:54.122
When did you guys get there?

647
00:45:54.147 --> 00:45:56.443
You guys are extremely confident.

648
00:45:57.528 --> 00:46:00.021
(What's going on?)

649
00:46:02.208 --> 00:46:05.326
- He likes being touched.
- Isn't he a pretty color?

650
00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:13.404
I've never seen anyone wear glasses over their facial mask.

651
00:46:13.429 --> 00:46:14.607
I can't see otherwise.

652
00:46:15.935 --> 00:46:16.990
(Embarrassed)

653
00:46:18.435 --> 00:46:20.122
(Amazed...)

654
00:46:24.428 --> 00:46:26.810
At what age did you guys start judo?

655
00:46:26.835 --> 00:46:28.622
- Ever since first grade.
- Eighth grade.

656
00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:31.411
- You guys train every day, right?
- Yes.

657
00:46:31.436 --> 00:46:32.560
How many hours per day?

658
00:46:32.867 --> 00:46:38.068
We train two hours at dawn, two hours in the morning, and two hours at night.

659
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.755
That must be very tiring. Do you train hard during those two hours?

660
00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:43.966
- It's exhausting.
- Really?

661
00:46:44.224 --> 00:46:47.060
- Fortunately, we have one year left.
- It's really fortunate.

662
00:46:47.428 --> 00:46:49.333
What will you guys do after that then?

663
00:46:49.662 --> 00:46:52.357
- We'll be on a business team.
- We'll be paid to play now.

664
00:46:52.382 --> 00:46:54.911
I see. I'm sure everyone won't be able to make it in though.

665
00:46:55.154 --> 00:46:56.747
What will you do if you don't make it?

666
00:46:57.204 --> 00:46:59.134
Some people become a coach...

667
00:46:59.364 --> 00:47:01.333
We get different salaries.

668
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.430
(They get paid depending on their skills.)

669
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:06.631
That's the same...

670
00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:09.574
I thought she was thin...

671
00:47:09.575 --> 00:47:12.997
But her shoulders are huge.

672
00:47:14.411 --> 00:47:15.411
Then...

673
00:47:16.302 --> 00:47:17.653
What's your weight class?

674
00:47:17.755 --> 00:47:18.755
57.

675
00:47:19.106 --> 00:47:20.536
That's similar to me...

676
00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:22.403
I'm 55kg.

677
00:47:22.915 --> 00:47:23.915
Go for it.

678
00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:25.795
Do you want to go against me tomorrow?

679
00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:28.540
What if she throws me around?

680
00:47:29.669 --> 00:47:31.069
Of course she will...

681
00:47:36.044 --> 00:47:37.044
Guys.

682
00:47:37.403 --> 00:47:39.708
Hyo-ri needs to go to bed.

683
00:47:39.743 --> 00:47:41.493
Let's have fun tomorrow.

684
00:47:41.646 --> 00:47:42.646
Good night!

685
00:47:43.083 --> 00:47:44.411
Good night.

686
00:47:46.208 --> 00:47:50.140
(2nd floor gets ready for bed.)

687
00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:54.229
(The couple gets ready for bed as well.)

688
00:47:55.931 --> 00:47:57.853
(When curtains close...)

689
00:47:58.513 --> 00:47:59.513
Isn't it cozy?

690
00:47:59.567 --> 00:48:00.567
It is.

691
00:48:00.837 --> 00:48:01.837
Go inside.

692
00:48:09.239 --> 00:48:10.306
Do it side ways.

693
00:48:11.274 --> 00:48:12.462
How?

694
00:48:12.974 --> 00:48:14.239
Like a mirror.

695
00:48:16.478 --> 00:48:17.923
That's scary!

696
00:48:18.142 --> 00:48:19.312
That's really scary!

697
00:48:19.337 --> 00:48:20.731
I'm gonna see it in my dreams!

698
00:48:22.509 --> 00:48:25.227
(Terrifying look from the back.)

699
00:48:25.228 --> 00:48:26.228
Stop.

700
00:48:26.548 --> 00:48:27.548
Stop.

701
00:48:27.778 --> 00:48:29.527
What's wrong with him?

702
00:48:29.528 --> 00:48:31.139
(Innocent.)

703
00:48:31.927 --> 00:48:35.179
(Before they go to bed...)

704
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:37.466
Should I search Lee Sang-soon?

705
00:48:37.724 --> 00:48:39.731
Stop it already.

706
00:48:41.497 --> 00:48:44.786
(Lee Sang-soon's searching Lee Sang-soon.)

707
00:48:44.931 --> 00:48:47.860
Better than chaebol?

708
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.360
Lee me see.

709
00:48:49.657 --> 00:48:50.657
Why?

710
00:48:51.591 --> 00:48:53.981
Grocery shopping with Hyo-ri?

711
00:48:55.685 --> 00:48:58.018
The size difference in faces was...

712
00:48:58.899 --> 00:49:02.545
(Taken when they were grocery shopping.)

713
00:49:04.427 --> 00:49:05.427
Soonsim!

714
00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.375
Tell mom I said good night.

715
00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:12.157
Good night.

716
00:49:12.196 --> 00:49:13.330
See you tomorrow.

717
00:49:14.415 --> 00:49:18.612
(The first day is finally over.)

718
00:49:20.075 --> 00:49:25.201
(When everyone was asleep...)

719
00:49:28.435 --> 00:49:34.757
(Heavy snow came without a warning.)

720
00:49:38.235 --> 00:49:43.088
(The whole house is being covered.)

721
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:51.397
(Midal: Snow!)

722
00:49:51.501 --> 00:49:53.101
(Soonsim: It's snowing!)

723
00:49:53.689 --> 00:49:56.695
(Guana: I'm so happy!)

724
00:49:56.743 --> 00:49:57.743
Guana!

725
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.727
(Why me...)

726
00:50:04.064 --> 00:50:07.321
(Thankfully, the guests are still asleep.)

727
00:50:10.689 --> 00:50:14.381
(Someone goes to the table.)

728
00:50:15.716 --> 00:50:19.461
(Hyo-ri woke up for morning yoga class.)

729
00:50:20.575 --> 00:50:24.602
(Wants to meditate before leaving.)

730
00:50:27.462 --> 00:50:32.506
(Lighting candles for meditating.)

731
00:50:36.317 --> 00:50:41.548
(And sees outside...)

732
00:50:42.384 --> 00:50:45.629
(Snow...)

733
00:50:48.513 --> 00:50:53.487
(Snowflakes dance beautifully.)

734
00:50:56.083 --> 00:51:01.853
(Makes a warm cup of tea.)

735
00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:11.249
(Meditating with snow as her friend.)

736
00:51:14.528 --> 00:51:17.674
(But.)

737
00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:22.803
(Snow turned into hail.)

738
00:51:25.907 --> 00:51:30.789
(You can even hear thunder...)

739
00:51:39.099 --> 00:51:43.720
(This doesn't sound good...)

740
00:51:53.798 --> 00:51:58.287
(Frozen.)

741
00:51:58.939 --> 00:52:03.361
(Because of the scary weather...)

742
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:07.499
(She' gets nervous and worried.)

743
00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:12.017
(But they look very comfortable.)

744
00:52:17.782 --> 00:52:22.862
(Nothing can wake them up right now.)

745
00:52:23.825 --> 00:52:27.811
(Scared Soonsim comes to her mom.)

746
00:52:28.021 --> 00:52:31.436
(Mom, I'm scared.)

747
00:52:33.618 --> 00:52:38.156
(Hyo-ri goes to make Soonsim feel better.)

748
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:41.207
(She gives up on yoga)

749
00:52:41.208 --> 00:52:44.824
(and goes to bed with Soonsim.)

750
00:52:47.071 --> 00:52:50.672
(After a loud night...)

751
00:52:50.673 --> 00:52:54.190
(Morning finally comes.)

752
00:52:54.267 --> 00:52:57.013
(Morning comes to the employee's house.)

753
00:52:57.728 --> 00:53:00.460
(Where is she?)

754
00:53:05.485 --> 00:53:09.380
(She woke up early.)

755
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:14.057
(Looks much more relaxed than yesterday.)

756
00:53:14.497 --> 00:53:18.177
(Wears her hair up today.)

757
00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.636
(#poophair.)

758
00:53:22.946 --> 00:53:25.454
(It may be cloudy, )

759
00:53:25.548 --> 00:53:29.016
(but her mood is very bright.)

760
00:53:30.802 --> 00:53:31.935
That's so pretty.

761
00:53:35.864 --> 00:53:37.923
(Hyo-ri's front yard)

762
00:53:37.954 --> 00:53:39.599
(is covered by a white blanket.)

763
00:53:41.962 --> 00:53:45.211
(She makes first footprints on snow.)

764
00:53:45.212 --> 00:53:48.474
(Except Gosil.)

765
00:53:53.083 --> 00:53:55.062
(Executives still asleep.)

766
00:53:55.063 --> 00:53:57.686
(Guests still asleep.)

767
00:53:57.739 --> 00:54:00.802
(Guana still asleep.)

768
00:54:07.427 --> 00:54:10.200
(Someone's here!)

769
00:54:10.591 --> 00:54:13.325
(Who are you!)

770
00:54:18.935 --> 00:54:22.964
(What a welcome.)

771
00:54:24.228 --> 00:54:25.294
What time is it?

772
00:54:25.571 --> 00:54:26.571
8.

773
00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:30.753
(Sang-soon overslept.)

774
00:54:31.302 --> 00:54:32.771
Did it snow a lot?

775
00:54:32.974 --> 00:54:34.278
It accumulated.

776
00:54:36.153 --> 00:54:41.475
(The house turned white over night.)

777
00:54:43.091 --> 00:54:47.717
(The whole town is covered in snow.)

778
00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:54.246
(A warning across all Jeju...)

779
00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:58.716
(High wind alert.)

780
00:54:59.399 --> 00:55:04.214
(Arrives on the 2nd floor as well.)

781
00:55:05.978 --> 00:55:10.741
(The warning alarm wakes them up.)

782
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:18.412
(Tired.)

783
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.871
Yoon-ah?

784
00:55:20.872 --> 00:55:21.872
Hi.

785
00:55:21.896 --> 00:55:24.083
(Hyo-ri wakes up too.)

786
00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:25.755
It snowed a lot outside.

787
00:55:26.626 --> 00:55:28.774
It snowed a lot over night.

788
00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:33.806
Can the guests get here today?

789
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.380
Today?

790
00:55:35.435 --> 00:55:38.924
(Worried about the guests.)

791
00:55:39.064 --> 00:55:42.324
(Snow falls even harder now.)

792
00:55:42.446 --> 00:55:43.892
Should I put rice in water?

793
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.892
Even though we don't know when we'll eat...

794
00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:58.781
(Washes rice.)

795
00:56:01.095 --> 00:56:05.820
(Then soaks it in water.)

796
00:56:07.083 --> 00:56:09.944
Hi.

797
00:56:10.036 --> 00:56:11.191
Did you sleep well?

798
00:56:11.192 --> 00:56:12.192
Yes.

799
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:14.272
Did the dogs wake you up last night?

800
00:56:14.321 --> 00:56:17.356
(Nope, slept through it.)

801
00:56:17.439 --> 00:56:18.695
Wear socks.

802
00:56:18.696 --> 00:56:20.096
Aren't you guys cold?

803
00:56:21.552 --> 00:56:25.768
(Always worried about her guests.)

804
00:56:27.712 --> 00:56:28.712
Jae-ran.

805
00:56:29.532 --> 00:56:30.532
Hye-bin.

806
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:31.849
Ye-sol.

807
00:56:32.208 --> 00:56:33.208
Ye-rin.

808
00:56:35.106 --> 00:56:36.668
Eun...

809
00:56:36.669 --> 00:56:38.555
(Almost there...)

810
00:56:38.556 --> 00:56:41.260
(Come on brain!)

811
00:56:41.392 --> 00:56:43.148
I'm really sorry.

812
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.060
Eun-young.

813
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:47.349
Eun-hyun?

814
00:56:47.458 --> 00:56:48.458
Hyun?

815
00:56:48.528 --> 00:56:51.412
(She always approach her guests first.)

816
00:56:51.532 --> 00:56:53.250
(Happy.)

817
00:56:53.251 --> 00:56:55.387
Yoon-ah's still pretty today.

818
00:56:56.634 --> 00:56:57.634
Yoon-ah's pretty face...

819
00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:01.083
Still works hard today.

820
00:57:03.532 --> 00:57:06.159
Yoon-ah's face hard at work.

821
00:57:07.755 --> 00:57:09.449
(Yoon-ah really starts to work)

822
00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.799
(in the kitchen.)

823
00:57:12.966 --> 00:57:16.132
(Let's make breakfast.)

824
00:57:16.474 --> 00:57:18.466
(Abalone porridge.)

825
00:57:18.825 --> 00:57:22.560
(Starts to cut vegetables first.)

826
00:57:22.653 --> 00:57:26.080
(Judoist 1 is watching.)

827
00:57:26.497 --> 00:57:28.544
(Judoist 2.)

828
00:57:29.641 --> 00:57:31.821
(She's so pretty.)

829
00:57:33.259 --> 00:57:36.327
(The news spread.)

830
00:57:36.454 --> 00:57:39.569
(She's so pretty...)

831
00:57:40.138 --> 00:57:42.306
(Crowded.)

832
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:43.939
What's going on?

833
00:57:44.567 --> 00:57:46.052
(Shy.)

834
00:57:46.126 --> 00:57:48.593
You guys couldn't wash up yet, right?

835
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:50.767
They went to get water.

836
00:57:52.243 --> 00:57:55.999
(Removing snow from the tub.)

837
00:57:56.024 --> 00:57:59.816
(Snow and ice accumulated over night.)

838
00:58:00.997 --> 00:58:07.093
(Cleaning for their guests.)

839

(Sogil's deicing king.)

840
00:58:15.419 --> 00:58:18.958
(After turning on the hot water...)

841
00:58:19.185 --> 00:58:22.336
(The tub is ready.)

842
00:58:23.302 --> 00:58:25.724
(See you in 2 hours.)

843
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.894
(Removing snow from the terrace.)

(When Yoon-ah washes the abalone, )

846
00:58:43.216 --> 00:58:46.626
(Sang-soon cuts them.)

847
00:58:46.782 --> 00:58:49.596
(Division of labor.)

848
00:58:50.333 --> 00:58:53.798
(After cleaning...)

849
00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.564
(She gets tea for her guests.)

850
00:58:59.942 --> 00:59:01.241
Do you guys want some tea?

851
00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:02.790
Okay!

852
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:05.367
(Hungry judoists enters.)

853
00:59:05.368 --> 00:59:07.367
We learned how to drink tea yesterday.

854
00:59:07.368 --> 00:59:08.368
Really?

855
00:59:10.532 --> 00:59:13.071
(A warm cup of tea)

856
00:59:13.126 --> 00:59:15.713
(on a cold winter morning.)

857
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.994
What tea is this?

858
00:59:19.126 --> 00:59:20.126
Pure tea.

859
00:59:21.114 --> 00:59:23.067
Drinking tea before games is awesome.

860
00:59:23.634 --> 00:59:24.634
It is.

861
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:27.450
It can calm you down.

862
00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:29.990
Don't you guys lose if you think

863
00:59:30.224 --> 00:59:31.757
I might lose this game?

864
00:59:32.505 --> 00:59:34.474
Yes...

865
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:36.997
Mental is very important in sports too.

866
00:59:37.481 --> 00:59:39.689
Do you have videos of your games?

867
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:41.350
Show her Jae-ran's games.

868
00:59:42.126 --> 00:59:43.126
Let's see.

869
00:59:43.981 --> 00:59:45.723
(Jae-ran's old game.)

870
00:59:45.724 --> 00:59:47.317
(Jae-ran's in blue.)

871
00:59:47.427 --> 00:59:49.056
She kicked a lot.

872
00:59:49.057 --> 00:59:50.057
Is that allowed?

873
00:59:50.106 --> 00:59:51.106
Yes.

874
00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:54.743
You tripped her over!

875
00:59:55.435 --> 00:59:56.768
She's on top of her.

876
00:59:58.450 --> 00:59:59.560
Back hug!

877
01:00:00.743 --> 01:00:03.267
That looks like Sang-soon and me fighting.

878
01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:07.003
(He's fighting against abalones.)

879
01:00:07.962 --> 01:00:10.753
(The game has slowed down.)

880
01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:12.821
Are you trying to get her inside leg?

881
01:00:12.903 --> 01:00:15.626
(Then she struck at a speed of light.)

882
01:00:16.189 --> 01:00:18.087
She looks so different

883
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.433
in this video...

884
01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:23.831
(You guys really were good...)

885
01:00:24.849 --> 01:00:28.138
(The tub is filling up...)

886
01:00:28.399 --> 01:00:30.254
(The guests are talking)

887
01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:31.851
(among themselves.)

888
01:00:31.852 --> 01:00:34.089
(Hmm...)

889
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.800
What do you guys normally talk about?

890
01:00:35.837 --> 01:00:37.251
Do you guys talk about celebrities?

891
01:00:37.306 --> 01:00:38.306
Yes.

892
01:00:39.497 --> 01:00:41.793
(Looks happy.)

893
01:00:41.794 --> 01:00:44.711
(Celebrities...)

894
01:00:44.965 --> 01:00:46.474
I want to see Park Bo-gum...

895
01:00:47.106 --> 01:00:48.517
Before I die.

896
01:00:49.192 --> 01:00:51.542
(She's at it again...)

897
01:00:51.552 --> 01:00:53.434
(Park Bo-gum...?)

898
01:00:53.513 --> 01:00:55.801
Didn't he said I was his ideal woman

899
01:00:55.802 --> 01:00:58.225
in one interview?

900
01:00:59.321 --> 01:01:01.305
(Shocked.)

901
01:01:01.306 --> 01:01:03.504
Why don't you look it up?

902
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.826
I saw it somewhere.

903
01:01:04.884 --> 01:01:05.884
(No way.)

904
01:01:05.939 --> 01:01:06.939
(Seriously?)

905
01:01:06.974 --> 01:01:07.974
(Upset.)

906
01:01:08.517 --> 01:01:10.610
You guys should know these already.

907
01:01:11.204 --> 01:01:12.204
Am I right?

908
01:01:13.802 --> 01:01:14.802
No?

909
01:01:15.017 --> 01:01:16.017
Am I right?

910
01:01:16.064 --> 01:01:17.064
Nope...

911
01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:18.676
I swear I saw it!

912
01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:19.759
Let me see.

913
01:01:19.814 --> 01:01:20.947
It doesn't exist.

914
01:01:21.294 --> 01:01:23.020
I'm going to search Park Bo-gum

915
01:01:23.021 --> 01:01:24.621
Lee Hyo-ri, ideal woman.

916
01:01:25.087 --> 01:01:28.040
It should've come up on related topics.

917
01:01:28.239 --> 01:01:29.239
It didn't.

918
01:01:30.231 --> 01:01:31.231
Look!

919
01:01:31.653 --> 01:01:35.974
Park Bo-gum's ideal woman is Lee Hyo-ri.

920
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.880
See?

921
01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:39.916
Let me read it...

922
01:01:39.939 --> 01:01:42.554
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...)

923
01:01:42.751 --> 01:01:44.649
Why is there only one article about it?

924
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:47.591
He probably didn't mean it...

925
01:01:48.157 --> 01:01:50.587
Let me find out the truth.

926
01:01:51.747 --> 01:01:52.747
Look!

927
01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:54.481
He's looking at my picture!

928
01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.680
That's when he was really young.

929
01:01:56.739 --> 01:01:59.059
(Evidence.)

930
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.846
That picture isn't recent.

931
01:02:02.126 --> 01:02:03.126
Look.

932
01:02:03.571 --> 01:02:06.532
I used to like FIN.K.L a lot as a child.

933
01:02:06.533 --> 01:02:07.902
I was so sad about not making

934
01:02:07.903 --> 01:02:09.237
to Hyo-ri's concert.

935
01:02:09.989 --> 01:02:13.312
(I can't hear anything right now...)

936
01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:16.870
Just saying.

937
01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:21.649
Have you ever met him?

938
01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:23.433
Nope...

939
01:02:24.747 --> 01:02:26.996
Didn't he get really popular

940
01:02:26.997 --> 01:02:28.528
when I was taking some time off?

941
01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:32.716
But he's so handsome...

942
01:02:34.106 --> 01:02:35.770
I could tell him to come over

943
01:02:35.771 --> 01:02:37.286
if I knew him...

944
01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:39.306
I want to get to know him too...

945
01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:43.567
Who is it?

946
01:02:43.599 --> 01:02:47.243
(And that really happened...)

947
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:48.950
Who is it?

948
01:02:49.005 --> 01:02:52.600
(And that really happened...)

949
01:02:54.106 --> 01:02:55.106
Hyo-ri!

950
01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:56.737
Isn't that Park Bo-gum?

951
01:02:56.738 --> 01:02:57.738
No way!

952
01:02:58.189 --> 01:02:59.189
Stop lying.

953
01:02:59.204 --> 01:03:00.204
Seriously.

954
01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.220
What?

955
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:03.341
Who?

956
01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.633
Who?

957
01:03:07.195 --> 01:03:09.294
(He's coming...)

958
01:03:09.295 --> 01:03:11.153
(I'm running.)

959
01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:14.266
(Mom, calm down.)

960
01:03:15.501 --> 01:03:17.583
(He's coming like a snowfall...)

961
01:03:17.584 --> 01:03:18.817
Hi!

962
01:03:19.017 --> 01:03:20.434
It's Park Bo-gum.

963
01:03:20.558 --> 01:03:21.808
Bo-gum?

964
01:03:23.394 --> 01:03:24.394
Hi!

965
01:03:24.462 --> 01:03:27.975
(Park Bo-gum is really here...)

966
01:03:28.149 --> 01:03:30.015
Hi.

967
01:03:30.359 --> 01:03:31.974
Hello.

968
01:03:32.655 --> 01:03:35.989
(Shock and awe.)

969
01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.424
(This man who came with snow...)

970
01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:42.990
(Is a good cook.)

971
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:45.883
(Is good at cleaning.)

972
01:03:45.884 --> 01:03:49.435
(Is a good pianist.)

973
01:03:49.436 --> 01:03:51.663
(Loves dogs.)

974
01:03:51.664 --> 01:03:53.120
(Has a bright smile.)

975
01:03:53.133 --> 01:03:54.788
(Is smart.)

976
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.760
(And is handsome when he's sleeping too.)

977
01:03:57.012 --> 01:04:00.030
(Park Bo-gum is coming.)

978
01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:01.280
(One day...)

979
01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:05.734
(Doesn't know their future.)

980
01:04:09.464 --> 01:04:12.087
(Officially started to cook.)

981
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:15.752
(Cut abalones into bite size pieces.)

982
01:04:15.753 --> 01:04:19.279
(Grind abalone's intestines.)

983
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:24.427
(Fry them together with abalones.)

984
01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:28.399
(Then boil with rice soaked in water.)

985
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.913
(Needs plenty of water.)

986
01:04:34.523 --> 01:04:37.858
(Time to dice vegetables.)

987
01:04:45.056 --> 01:04:47.947
(It's diced...)

988
01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.637
I brought a must have item.

989
01:04:50.638 --> 01:04:51.638
What's this?

990
01:04:51.692 --> 01:04:52.759
It's for dicing.

991
01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.117
For garlic?

992
01:04:54.118 --> 01:04:55.118
For any vegetables.

993
01:04:55.314 --> 01:04:56.314
Like this?

994
01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.073
Just put vegetables inside...

995
01:04:58.368 --> 01:04:59.835
It works very quickly.

996
01:04:59.923 --> 01:05:00.923
That's so cool!

997
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:09.310
(New technology...)

998
01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:10.760
Do you wanna try it?

999
01:05:12.271 --> 01:05:13.404
Does it look fun?

1000
01:05:13.521 --> 01:05:15.090
(Guilty.)

1001
01:05:19.103 --> 01:05:22.856
(Put diced vegetables.)

1002
01:05:22.857 --> 01:05:24.135
Is it going to overflow?

1003
01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:30.802
(Then scoop some out)

1004
01:05:31.821 --> 01:05:40.939
(Grind one more time to make it soft.)

1005
01:05:41.036 --> 01:05:43.919
(Finally, add some soy sauce.)

1006
01:05:44.126 --> 01:05:45.421
(This is...)

1007
01:05:45.446 --> 01:05:48.240
(Yoon-ah's abalone porridge.)

1008
01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:51.661
Let's eat!

1009
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.096
Take some with you.

1010
01:05:54.696 --> 01:05:55.696
Have some more.

1011
01:05:57.583 --> 01:06:00.935
(They're lining up for some reason...)

1012
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.765
(Feels like a cafeteria...)

1013
01:06:07.606 --> 01:06:11.204
(Hyo-ri's cafeteria.)

1014
01:06:13.099 --> 01:06:14.403
Thank you.

1015
01:06:17.704 --> 01:06:20.455
(A back hug to cut sea weed.)

1016
01:06:20.532 --> 01:06:21.532
Is that okay?

1017
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.287
Do you want Park Bo-gum to do this?

1018
01:06:24.368 --> 01:06:25.368
Think about it.

1019
01:06:25.689 --> 01:06:27.473
I won't be able to breathe.

1020
01:06:30.896 --> 01:06:34.095
(Finally time to eat.)

1021
01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:37.032
Let's see how Yoon-ah's first breakfast is.

1022
01:06:39.368 --> 01:06:40.946
(Amazing.)

1023
01:06:41.337 --> 01:06:42.337
It's good.

1024
01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:43.763
I'm glad.

1025
01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:50.083
(The guests love it.)

1026
01:06:53.689 --> 01:06:55.751
I haven't had this in ages.

1027
01:06:55.974 --> 01:06:57.724
I woke up really early today...

1028
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:59.872
And it was snowing even harder.

1029
01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:02.462
I thought we'd get stranded.

1030
01:07:02.892 --> 01:07:05.223
I was wondering how we'll feed

1031
01:07:05.224 --> 01:07:06.919
five girls...

1032
01:07:07.337 --> 01:07:08.696
It's a big problem.

1033
01:07:11.091 --> 01:07:13.629
(But they're not worried...)

1034
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:16.950
(They're not even talking.)

1035
01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:19.485
Was that too little?

1036
01:07:20.638 --> 01:07:21.638
Have some more.

1037
01:07:25.403 --> 01:07:27.075
That was delicious.

1038
01:07:28.755 --> 01:07:33.204
(Everyone loved Yoon-ah's first breakfast.)

1039
01:07:36.583 --> 01:07:38.103
(Paying back for the meal...)

1040
01:07:38.104 --> 01:07:40.732
(By doing the dishes.)

1041
01:07:40.733 --> 01:07:41.733
Just do the plates.

1042
01:07:41.747 --> 01:07:43.871
I can do the rest.

1043
01:07:43.872 --> 01:07:45.250
(Ignored.)

1044
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:46.384
It's really okay.

1045
01:07:46.489 --> 01:07:47.989
I used those plates...

1046
01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:49.947
I used those pots...

1047
01:07:52.954 --> 01:07:55.201
(A brick wall.)

1048
01:07:55.298 --> 01:07:57.181
Go get ready instead.

1049
01:07:57.962 --> 01:07:58.962
It's okay.

1050
01:07:59.001 --> 01:08:02.243
(Tries to go in.)

1051
01:08:03.048 --> 01:08:04.867
Hye-bin!

1052
01:08:05.899 --> 01:08:07.116
Please move...

1053
01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.963
(Who's bothering my friends?)

1054
01:08:11.403 --> 01:08:13.761
Please...

1055
01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:19.854
(Don't ever look down on judoists.)

1056
01:08:20.278 --> 01:08:22.362
(Yoon-ah's attempt failed.)

1057
01:08:23.208 --> 01:08:26.984
(Hyo-ri's making bath bombs.)

1058
01:08:27.071 --> 01:08:29.048
Would this be better since they're girls?

1059
01:08:30.638 --> 01:08:33.015
You make your own?

1060
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:36.001
I'm jealous.

1061
01:08:36.087 --> 01:08:37.289
They'll be really relaxed.

1062
01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:38.899
What if they don't want to leave?

1063
01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:42.286
I got these from a bazaar.

1064
01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:45.997
This is a medicinal wormwood.

1065
01:08:47.704 --> 01:08:49.517
It's food for women.

1066
01:08:50.157 --> 01:08:51.424
It smells good too.

1067
01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:53.430
This is so weird.

1068
01:08:53.431 --> 01:08:55.324
I bought these last summer...

1069
01:08:55.739 --> 01:08:58.427
I didn't know I'd get to use the tub.

1070
01:08:58.954 --> 01:09:01.231
But it's good that you did now.

1071
01:09:02.587 --> 01:09:04.110
Sang-soon nagged me so much...

1072
01:09:04.548 --> 01:09:07.049
You don't even use them!

1073
01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:09.960
You don't even drink the extracts!

1074
01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:12.095
But look!

1075
01:09:12.345 --> 01:09:13.345
Sang-soon!

1076
01:09:15.431 --> 01:09:16.953
They're useful.

1077
01:09:16.954 --> 01:09:18.469
See how useful they are?

1078
01:09:20.071 --> 01:09:21.881
I should give these extracts to them too.

1079
01:09:24.204 --> 01:09:25.737
Do you guys want these?

1080
01:09:25.782 --> 01:09:27.182
They're good for you!

1081
01:09:30.368 --> 01:09:34.593
(The bath bomb goes into the tub.)

1082
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:35.697
It turned green.

1083
01:09:35.856 --> 01:09:36.856
What?

1084
01:09:37.032 --> 01:09:38.774
The water turned green.

1085
01:09:39.661 --> 01:09:41.333
That's right!

1086
01:09:41.505 --> 01:09:42.943
Perfect temperature.

1087
01:09:43.782 --> 01:09:44.782
What's that?

1088
01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:47.614
(Hyo-ri brought colored pencils.)

1089
01:09:48.548 --> 01:09:50.881
It'll be cute to draw eyes on here.

1090
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560
Eyes!

1091
01:09:53.778 --> 01:09:54.778
Face!

1092
01:09:58.829 --> 01:10:03.016
(Firewood in love. by Yoon-ah Lim.)

1093
01:10:05.396 --> 01:10:08.064
(Thick eyebrows.)

1094
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.552
That looks like your facial expression.

1095
01:10:15.923 --> 01:10:16.923
This is me!

1096
01:10:17.247 --> 01:10:22.446
(A Mean Woman. by Hyo-ri Lee.)

1097

(Complete.)

1098
01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.060
Stupid.

1099
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:31.625
The weather's so good!

1100
01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:35.018
(Sun is shining again.)

1101
01:10:36.892 --> 01:10:39.292
(There will be as many stories here)

1102
01:10:39.314 --> 01:10:41.980
(as the number of faces on these woods.)

1103
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:45.235
Guys, hurry up!

1104
01:10:48.673 --> 01:10:51.064
That's better than me...

1105
01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:56.364
(Hyo-ri's tub finally opens.)

1106
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:57.470
It's too hot!

1107
01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:58.821
It's perfect.

1108
01:10:58.899 --> 01:10:59.899
Go inside.

1109
01:11:00.067 --> 01:11:02.905
(Goes in!)

1110
01:11:03.028 --> 01:11:05.073
(Gives up quickly.)

1111
01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.428
There's the faucet!

1112
01:11:06.505 --> 01:11:07.505
Turn it left!

1113
01:11:09.052 --> 01:11:10.052
That way.

1114
01:11:12.192 --> 01:11:13.708
(Tries to go in again!)

1115
01:11:13.896 --> 01:11:15.325
Send some cold water here!

1116
01:11:17.126 --> 01:11:19.056
Try to sit down a bit first.

1117
01:11:19.935 --> 01:11:20.935
Good.

1118
01:11:21.161 --> 01:11:22.161
Is it okay?

1119
01:11:23.337 --> 01:11:26.103
It needs to be hot!

1120
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.482
I think it's good!

1121
01:11:27.864 --> 01:11:29.644
Turn the water off!

1122
01:11:29.739 --> 01:11:31.121
(Water's in perfect temperature.)

1123
01:11:31.122 --> 01:11:32.189
That's adorable!

1124
01:11:37.396 --> 01:11:39.571
You'll get hurt!

1125
01:11:41.419 --> 01:11:44.598
(Hot water massage for her friends.)

1126
01:11:46.114 --> 01:11:49.654
(Hot.)

1127
01:11:50.794 --> 01:11:54.501
(But they're loving it.)

1128
01:11:55.376 --> 01:11:57.454
They look adorable in there!

1129
01:11:57.954 --> 01:11:59.287
Leave your toes out

1130
01:11:59.345 --> 01:12:00.745
then it's not as hot!

1131
01:12:07.653 --> 01:12:08.653
Is it snowing?

1132
01:12:09.005 --> 01:12:10.342
Just a bit!

1133
01:12:11.907 --> 01:12:12.907
Nice.

1134
01:12:14.185 --> 01:12:17.567
(Even more romantic with snow.)

What's that?

1137
01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.286
That's adorable!

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:29.872
Do you want some snacks?

1141
01:12:30.165 --> 01:12:31.165
Okay!

1142
01:12:31.997 --> 01:12:33.630
Give them some cherry.

1143
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:35.407
Wait.

1144
01:12:35.446 --> 01:12:36.860
I have something for you.

1145
01:12:38.606 --> 01:12:41.126
(Extracts for guests!)

1146
01:12:41.245 --> 01:12:42.245
This one?

1147
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:44.044
I heard it's really good for you.

1148
01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:47.027
But it's not really good...

1149
01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.396
But you have tons.

1150
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:52.530
Here.

1151
01:12:52.571 --> 01:12:54.404
(Here's your mission.)

1152
01:12:54.459 --> 01:12:56.025
Have them eat it for their health.

1153
01:12:56.207 --> 01:12:57.207
Okay.

1154
01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:59.406
I'll have one too.

1155
01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:03.756
Thank you.

1156
01:13:03.757 --> 01:13:05.315
They're not left overs!

1157
01:13:08.894 --> 01:13:10.392
You can heat them up in the tub.

1158
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:13.069
Heating it up makes it taste better.

1159
01:13:13.117 --> 01:13:15.413
(They already began.)

1160
01:13:16.777 --> 01:13:18.577
I should turn on some music

1161
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.620
those spa places use.

1162
01:13:25.064 --> 01:13:26.665
(Which song did DJ Soon choose?)

1163
01:13:28.879 --> 01:13:29.881
Likey!

1164
01:13:33.505 --> 01:13:35.750
Hearing this song in my house is so weird!

1165
01:13:35.775 --> 01:13:37.345
This song's perfect right now!

1166
01:13:39.239 --> 01:13:40.495
(Yoon-ah's version of Likey.)

1167
01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:41.496
This is how you do it.

1168
01:13:49.768 --> 01:13:51.855
(Hyo-ri's silly dance.)

1169
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:58.530
Try it again!

1170
01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:00.019
(Sexy.)

1171
01:14:01.745 --> 01:14:04.566
(A Likey dark horse.)

1172
01:14:05.449 --> 01:14:09.177
(Hyo-ri's not the one to lose this.)

1173
01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:15.752
(Likey time for everyone.)

1174
01:14:16.644 --> 01:14:18.793
(Dark horse, join us!)

1175
01:14:18.794 --> 01:14:19.794
Now!

1176
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:21.170
A bit more.

1177
01:14:25.547 --> 01:14:26.626
You're late.

1178
01:14:26.627 --> 01:14:28.984
(Criticized for missing the beat.)

1179
01:14:31.764 --> 01:14:34.755
(What's going on...)

1180
01:14:35.646 --> 01:14:36.992
(The weather cleared up.)

1181
01:14:36.993 --> 01:14:38.327
That was successful.

1182
01:14:39.836 --> 01:14:41.170
This weather...

1183
01:14:41.312 --> 01:14:42.646
The sun's beautiful.

1184
01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:45.089
The sun ray hitting on them...

1185
01:14:45.289 --> 01:14:46.355
Is beautiful....

1186
01:14:47.295 --> 01:14:48.295
Girls...

1187
01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:52.979
(Girls.)

1188
01:14:53.608 --> 01:14:54.608
It's so weird.

1189
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:56.172
I keep watching them

1190
01:14:56.173 --> 01:14:57.221
like how I watch our dogs.

1191
01:14:59.665 --> 01:15:01.071
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1192
01:15:01.793 --> 01:15:03.492
It's really nice with the sun out.

1193
01:15:03.754 --> 01:15:05.785
Isn't it beautiful?

1194
01:15:05.812 --> 01:15:07.263
(Sunshine...)

1195
01:15:07.264 --> 01:15:10.066
(And their faces.)

1196
01:15:10.445 --> 01:15:11.912
This music is perfect.

1197
01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:16.388
(A perfect choice by DJ Soon.)

1198
01:15:22.998 --> 01:15:24.198
They're so strong.

1199
01:15:24.221 --> 01:15:29.468
(Can't take her eyes off from the youth.)

1200
01:15:32.104 --> 01:15:33.172
Is it nice in there?

1201
01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:36.862
(Yoon-ah wants to take a picture.)

1202
01:15:36.996 --> 01:15:38.185
Act like we're friends!

1203
01:15:40.457 --> 01:15:43.073
(Checking the angle...)

1204
01:15:44.431 --> 01:15:46.087
(Comes closer.)

1205
01:15:46.165 --> 01:15:47.741
Let me take a photo.

1206
01:15:50.405 --> 01:15:53.342
(Decided on the app!)

1207
01:15:53.704 --> 01:15:55.366
One, two, three!

1208
01:15:57.505 --> 01:15:58.505
Adorable!

1209
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:01.940
I used an app.

1210
01:16:03.248 --> 01:16:04.315
She used an app.

1211
01:16:04.489 --> 01:16:06.432
(Looks forward to it.)

1212
01:16:06.605 --> 01:16:08.189
You guys are adorable.

1213
01:16:08.372 --> 01:16:09.372
I know!

1214
01:16:10.822 --> 01:16:11.888
They're so cute.

1215
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:14.151
(First guests in the tub. JPG)

1216
01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:19.194
I'll leave the towels here.

1217
01:16:21.731 --> 01:16:22.873
It's really slippery here.

1218
01:16:22.874 --> 01:16:23.874
Be careful.

1219
01:16:25.612 --> 01:16:28.642
(Staring.)

1220
01:16:28.847 --> 01:16:29.897
Are you looking at her

1221
01:16:29.898 --> 01:16:31.041
because she's so thin?

1222
01:16:31.042 --> 01:16:32.869
(Admits.)

1223
01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:34.713
(When Yoon-ah gets close...)

1224
01:16:34.714 --> 01:16:35.714
Thank you.

1225
01:16:36.473 --> 01:16:37.740
I'll put this here.

1226
01:16:38.244 --> 01:16:39.301
Wouldn't it get wet?

1227
01:16:39.302 --> 01:16:41.075
Put it over there.

1228
01:16:41.217 --> 01:16:42.538
There's no water there.

1229
01:16:44.611 --> 01:16:45.611
Okay.

1230
01:16:45.633 --> 01:16:47.732
(All frozen.)

1231
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.076
(Stares again.)

1232
01:16:50.622 --> 01:16:52.376
(When Yoon-ah goes in...)

1233
01:16:52.377 --> 01:16:53.377
(Smiles.)

1234
01:16:53.406 --> 01:16:55.029
Look at her smile!

1235
01:16:55.428 --> 01:16:56.734
She's so pretty.

1236
01:16:56.848 --> 01:16:58.955
We don't even talk when she's near...

1237
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.485
She's an idol for a reason.

1238
01:17:00.508 --> 01:17:01.942
We don't even respond.

1239
01:17:02.133 --> 01:17:05.050
(They're finally talking.)

1240
01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:06.888
Should we write

1241
01:17:07.209 --> 01:17:09.319
money isn't for spending

1242
01:17:09.511 --> 01:17:11.444
like Kim Saeng-min's Receipt?

1243
01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:12.680
No...

1244
01:17:12.705 --> 01:17:13.828
Travel is for resting.

1245
01:17:14.781 --> 01:17:16.348
Let's think about it some more.

1246
01:17:17.293 --> 01:17:18.492
(Deep in thought.)

1247
01:17:18.493 --> 01:17:19.493
Travel...

1248
01:17:21.026 --> 01:17:22.092
Is about eating.

1249
01:17:23.682 --> 01:17:24.682
Travel...

1250
01:17:25.365 --> 01:17:26.565
Is about learning.

1251
01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:28.412
No?

1252
01:17:28.651 --> 01:17:29.651
(Cheesy.)

1253
01:17:29.717 --> 01:17:30.717
Travel...

1254
01:17:31.183 --> 01:17:32.449
Is about not going.

1255
01:17:33.221 --> 01:17:34.897
Travel is about doing nothing.

1256
01:17:35.415 --> 01:17:36.415
That's good.

1257
01:17:38.415 --> 01:17:40.766
(Randomly stretches out.)

1258
01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:41.947
Short.

1259
01:17:41.999 --> 01:17:43.199
It fits perfectly.

1260
01:17:44.222 --> 01:17:45.289
Can you do this?

1261
01:17:45.425 --> 01:17:46.425
Of course.

1262
01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:48.787
Let's see how far you can go.

1263
01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:53.200
(Just like sitting on a chair.)

1264
01:17:53.249 --> 01:17:55.090
I can sit too!

1265
01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.060
Move.

1266
01:17:58.963 --> 01:18:00.610
(Tries to reach while sitting down.)

1267
01:18:00.611 --> 01:18:01.744
You can sit down?

1268
01:18:03.004 --> 01:18:04.138
You can sit down?

1269
01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:05.688
(Success?)

1270
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:07.030
Yoon-ah, can you do this?

1271
01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:09.117
How?

1272
01:18:09.132 --> 01:18:10.761
Can you sit down and reach over there?

1273
01:18:13.079 --> 01:18:14.293
(Failed to sit down.)

1274
01:18:14.294 --> 01:18:16.083
Long legs doesn't mean you can do it!

1275
01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:18.933
You have longer legs because you're a man.

1276
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:21.375
(Psh.)

1277
01:18:21.605 --> 01:18:22.605
Yoon-ah, can you do this?

1278
01:18:22.836 --> 01:18:25.888
(Next event.)

1279
01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.178
(Falls down.)

1280
01:18:32.328 --> 01:18:33.612
Bowing?

1281
01:18:33.613 --> 01:18:35.734
I can do it too.

1282
01:18:35.735 --> 01:18:37.392
(Bowing competition?)

1283
01:18:37.435 --> 01:18:38.435
I can do it!

1284
01:18:38.465 --> 01:18:40.044
Were you talking about this?

1285
01:18:42.132 --> 01:18:43.132
Two.

1286
01:18:43.872 --> 01:18:44.872
3.

1287
01:18:45.298 --> 01:18:46.298
4.

1288
01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:50.301
(I can...)

1289
01:18:51.654 --> 01:18:54.544
(Loves bowing down.)

1290
01:18:54.715 --> 01:18:55.780
How did you do that?

1291
01:18:55.868 --> 01:18:56.868
Try it.

1292
01:18:57.081 --> 01:18:58.252
(Yoon-ah goes for it.)

1293
01:18:58.253 --> 01:18:59.253
Grab here.

1294
01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.960
Like this?

1295
01:19:01.442 --> 01:19:02.692
Come down and go back up.

1296
01:19:03.103 --> 01:19:04.374
Go down.

1297
01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:05.513
Go down.

1298
01:19:06.131 --> 01:19:07.131
Exactly!

1299
01:19:07.495 --> 01:19:09.109
It's inevitable!

1300
01:19:09.572 --> 01:19:11.106
I think they can do it.

1301
01:19:11.369 --> 01:19:12.635
Of course they can.

1302
01:19:13.212 --> 01:19:15.141
(They're done using the tub.)

1303
01:19:15.191 --> 01:19:16.370
Squeeze your clothes.

1304
01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:17.387
Why?

1305
01:19:17.388 --> 01:19:18.450
How do we get out?

1306
01:19:18.516 --> 01:19:19.516
Come inside.

1307
01:19:20.037 --> 01:19:21.494
But we'll get the floor wet.

1308
01:19:21.578 --> 01:19:23.599
I'll put some towel on the floor.

1309
01:19:25.113 --> 01:19:27.102
Shake like a dog once.

1310
01:19:28.042 --> 01:19:29.093
You know that dance?

1311
01:19:29.553 --> 01:19:30.553
Shake.

1312
01:19:31.301 --> 01:19:32.834
Shake!

1313
01:19:33.521 --> 01:19:34.521
Come in.

1314
01:19:34.956 --> 01:19:35.956
Here.

1315
01:19:37.431 --> 01:19:38.764
We can just wipe it.

1316
01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:40.965
Then we can use this.

1317
01:19:41.072 --> 01:19:42.072
(Water wipe.)

1318
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:43.529
Good idea.

1319
01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:44.978
I should follow them.

1320
01:19:49.305 --> 01:19:50.305
Don't run.

1321
01:19:51.016 --> 01:19:52.016
It's okay.

1322
01:19:54.218 --> 01:19:56.352
It'd be better if it drips more.

1323
01:19:57.021 --> 01:19:58.417
So I can use this.

1324
01:19:59.923 --> 01:20:01.784
(Still very careful.)

1325
01:20:01.888 --> 01:20:02.992
They look cooked.

1326
01:20:04.843 --> 01:20:05.843
Good.

1327
01:20:07.284 --> 01:20:09.017
Water didn't drip...

1328
01:20:11.758 --> 01:20:13.910
Yoon-ah, rest while the go out.

1329
01:20:14.019 --> 01:20:15.019
Okay.

1330
01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:17.021
You two!

1331
01:20:18.323 --> 01:20:19.323
You two!

1332
01:20:21.286 --> 01:20:23.080
Guana on the left, Seoksam on my right.

1333
01:20:24.744 --> 01:20:27.521
(Her left and right hand.)

1334
01:20:28.503 --> 01:20:29.503
Give me a kiss.

1335
01:20:31.148 --> 01:20:32.867
Why is she rubbing her cheek on me?

1336
01:20:33.575 --> 01:20:34.753
She does this.

1337
01:20:34.754 --> 01:20:35.754
She wants to be touched.

1338
01:20:37.863 --> 01:20:39.592
Blizzard!

1339
01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:41.130
Look.

1340
01:20:41.174 --> 01:20:42.174
A blizzard.

1341
01:20:42.232 --> 01:20:45.129
(It was sunny just a minute ago.)

1342
01:20:45.602 --> 01:20:49.044
(But changed drastically in 30 minutes.)

1343
01:20:49.358 --> 01:20:50.358
Wow...

1344
01:20:50.383 --> 01:20:52.905
(Sogil turned into a winter world.)

1345
01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:54.725
Can they get out of the house?

1346
01:20:59.028 --> 01:21:00.228
Should we get out?

1347
01:21:01.701 --> 01:21:05.206
(Time in the tub finished by the weather.)

1348
01:21:07.241 --> 01:21:08.241
Nice!

1349
01:21:08.342 --> 01:21:09.542
That's so awesome.

1350
01:21:11.044 --> 01:21:12.044
Beautiful.

1351
01:21:13.914 --> 01:21:16.680
(It was awesome from the inside...)

1352
01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:18.332
(But it makes you scream)

1353
01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:19.782
(when you're in it.)

1354
01:21:21.257 --> 01:21:24.694
(Quickly checks the temporary shoe rack.)

1355
01:21:26.058 --> 01:21:27.694
Do you think they can leave the house?

1356
01:21:28.744 --> 01:21:29.744
Sang-soon!

1357
01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:31.752
Mr. Lee!

1358
01:21:31.796 --> 01:21:34.282
What's going on!

1359
01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:35.867
All hell's broken loose!

1360
01:21:37.037 --> 01:21:38.335
You always say the same thing.

1361
01:21:38.408 --> 01:21:40.533
Hell always break loose on you!

1362
01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.481
(Puts slippers inside to keep them dry.)

1363
01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.319
Let's put the others over there.

1364
01:21:48.546 --> 01:21:49.546
It's crazy.

1365
01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:51.238
You guys might have to stay inside!

1366
01:21:51.536 --> 01:21:54.448
How are they going to drive in this...

1367
01:21:54.584 --> 01:21:55.584
I know.

1368
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:58.537
Yoon-ah, come here.

1369
01:21:58.577 --> 01:21:59.710
That's beautiful.

1370
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:01.053
This is perfect for a slo-mo.

1371
01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:04.211
Can I use your phone?

1372
01:22:04.381 --> 01:22:05.381
Sure.

1373
01:22:06.938 --> 01:22:08.366
The current situation...

1374
01:22:09.295 --> 01:22:10.829
Amazing.

1375
01:22:14.765 --> 01:22:16.491
Get ready to run.

1376
01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:18.366
Run!

1377
01:22:26.246 --> 01:22:27.246
With the dogs!

1378
01:22:28.369 --> 01:22:30.302
(They're running in the snow)

1379
01:22:30.329 --> 01:22:31.854
(like the dogs.)

1380
01:22:31.866 --> 01:22:33.281
So much snow!

1381
01:22:33.678 --> 01:22:34.678
Mocha!

1382
01:22:37.344 --> 01:22:45.909
(Slo-mo shot by Sang-soon.)

1383
01:22:56.888 --> 01:23:03.200
(Jumping in the snow.)

1384
01:23:04.093 --> 01:23:11.619
(Looks like a movie in slo-mo.)

1385
01:23:14.051 --> 01:23:17.510
(In slo-mo...)

1386
01:23:17.511 --> 01:23:20.386
(Everything looks pretty...)

1387
01:23:21.587 --> 01:23:26.257
(If you watch for a long time...)

1388
01:23:26.258 --> 01:23:29.544
(He's very handsome...)

1389
01:23:30.206 --> 01:23:33.985
(You two...)

1390
01:23:34.294 --> 01:23:36.217
Run from over there, so we can hug.

1391
01:23:37.238 --> 01:23:38.572
Lift me up and spin!

1392
01:23:38.668 --> 01:23:39.668
Okay!

1393
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:40.851
Go!

1394
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:06.467
(But in reality...)

1395
01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.163
Put your feet down!

1396
01:24:08.245 --> 01:24:09.557
Put your feet down!

1397
01:24:09.622 --> 01:24:10.622
Exactly!

1398
01:24:11.154 --> 01:24:14.417
(Awkward.)

1399
01:24:14.533 --> 01:24:15.533
I'm dizzy.

1400
01:24:15.662 --> 01:24:19.307
(Why are they spinning around...?)

1401
01:24:19.574 --> 01:24:21.391
(That was fun.)

1402
01:24:21.392 --> 01:24:23.870
(Side effect: Dizziness.)

1403
01:24:26.299 --> 01:24:28.466
Perfect timing!

1404
01:24:28.995 --> 01:24:29.995
Midal!

1405
01:24:30.117 --> 01:24:31.117
Come here.

1406
01:24:31.977 --> 01:24:35.664
(Blizzard with love. avi)

1407
01:24:35.665 --> 01:24:36.999
It's not snowing as much.

1408
01:24:37.225 --> 01:24:39.158
Why did you hug me like this!

1409
01:24:40.073 --> 01:24:41.340
What's Gosil doing?

1410
01:24:43.799 --> 01:24:44.799
That was good.

1411
01:24:47.311 --> 01:24:48.959
Isn't this place fun?

1412
01:24:49.248 --> 01:24:50.314
It's not boring.

1413
01:24:51.817 --> 01:24:53.165
I think you two are good

1414
01:24:53.166 --> 01:24:54.766
at finding things to do.

1415
01:24:54.871 --> 01:24:55.903
Fun things?

1416
01:24:55.904 --> 01:24:56.904
Yes.

1417
01:24:57.093 --> 01:24:58.623
That's what happens when you're bored.

1418
01:24:58.698 --> 01:25:00.827
(A bored couple's hobby.)

1419
01:25:02.446 --> 01:25:07.188
(Waiting to take a shower.)

1420
01:25:08.117 --> 01:25:09.601
That was fun.

1421
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:12.657
Did you see Sang-soon's?

1422
01:25:12.658 --> 01:25:14.234
It looks awesome.

1423
01:25:14.235 --> 01:25:15.235
It's crazy.

1424
01:25:15.571 --> 01:25:17.009
He looks like Odagiri Joe.

1425
01:25:18.412 --> 01:25:20.109
When it was snowing the most.

1426
01:25:20.299 --> 01:25:21.299
That's good.

1427
01:25:21.328 --> 01:25:22.328
Handsome.

1428
01:25:22.894 --> 01:25:23.894
(Shy.)

1429
01:25:23.947 --> 01:25:25.467
Why do you smile like this?

1430
01:25:25.641 --> 01:25:27.303
You could just smile like this...

1431
01:25:28.599 --> 01:25:30.502
Why do you smile like this?

1432
01:25:31.899 --> 01:25:32.899
It's cute.

1433
01:25:33.775 --> 01:25:35.175
You look so handsome.

1434
01:25:36.054 --> 01:25:37.076
When he's looking back?

1435
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:40.322
I must be really in love.

1436
01:25:40.403 --> 01:25:41.653
Does he look handsome?

1437
01:25:43.603 --> 01:25:44.672
He looks lovely.

1438
01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:45.799
I did a good job.

1439
01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:48.961
I don't know your phone number...

1440
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.920
Yoon-ah's?

1441
01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.175
I think it's time.

1442
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:55.350
Anytime.

1443
01:25:55.972 --> 01:25:57.470
I need Hyo-ri's permission first.

1444
01:25:58.047 --> 01:25:59.047
No.

1445
01:25:59.094 --> 01:26:00.901
He'll text you in the middle of the night.

1446
01:26:00.902 --> 01:26:02.702
Yoon-ah, how are you doing?

1447
01:26:03.824 --> 01:26:04.957
Are you sleeping?

1448
01:26:06.222 --> 01:26:07.743
(Goosebumps.)

1449
01:26:07.815 --> 01:26:10.867
I should send this to Yoon-ah.

1450
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.465
What's your phone number?

1451
01:26:14.319 --> 01:26:15.517
That's your line?

1452
01:26:16.078 --> 01:26:17.803
I needed to send her the video.

1453
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.139
(Finally got her number.)

1454
01:26:22.854 --> 01:26:24.189
I'm going to save it.

1455
01:26:25.836 --> 01:26:27.729
(Proud.)

1456
01:26:27.828 --> 01:26:29.322
Now he has two female celebrity's

1457
01:26:29.323 --> 01:26:30.534
phone number in there.

1458
01:26:30.998 --> 01:26:31.998
Lee Ji-eun.

1459
01:26:32.739 --> 01:26:33.739
Yoon-ah.

1460
01:26:35.616 --> 01:26:36.616
He has two.

1461
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:37.651
3 including me.

1462
01:26:38.383 --> 01:26:40.186
(That's it.)

1463
01:26:40.212 --> 01:26:41.212
Right?

1464
01:26:42.346 --> 01:26:45.969
(Work: SNSD.)

1465
01:26:46.014 --> 01:26:47.336
Bed and breakfast employee.

1466
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.160
Are you guys going out?

1467
01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:52.247
Yup.

1468
01:26:52.276 --> 01:26:53.286
Do you guys feel fresh?

1469
01:26:53.323 --> 01:26:54.323
Have some.

1470
01:26:55.489 --> 01:26:56.847
Your skin looks better.

1471
01:26:58.153 --> 01:26:59.846
It looks soft.

1472
01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:02.487
(Confidence up.)

1473
01:27:02.849 --> 01:27:06.534
I'll ask how it is outside.

1474
01:27:07.564 --> 01:27:08.564
Hello?

1475
01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.436
I had a question.

1476
01:27:12.024 --> 01:27:13.925
Can cars go...

1477
01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.287
In front of your restaurant?

1478
01:27:17.968 --> 01:27:19.166
All melted?

1479
01:27:20.191 --> 01:27:21.923
Everything's frozen here.

1480
01:27:22.175 --> 01:27:23.452
They still need to be careful.

1481
01:27:23.656 --> 01:27:24.656
Okay.

1482
01:27:25.225 --> 01:27:26.480
Thank you!

1483
01:27:26.481 --> 01:27:28.805
(Roads seem okay.)

1484
01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:34.103
That surprised me.

1485
01:27:34.104 --> 01:27:35.104
What?

1486
01:27:36.002 --> 01:27:37.207
Look what I had!

1487
01:27:38.617 --> 01:27:41.222
I didn't know it was in here.

1488
01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:43.729
Do you want me to take a photo of you two?

1489
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:48.011
(Found a perfect option.)

1490
01:27:49.373 --> 01:27:51.972
(Let's do it right!)

1491
01:27:55.824 --> 01:27:56.824
Let me see.

1492
01:27:56.866 --> 01:27:59.177
(Why are you laughing?)

1493
01:28:01.997 --> 01:28:03.806
(Doesn't know what to say.)

1494
01:28:03.807 --> 01:28:04.807
Sang-soon!

1495
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.833
You look fine.

1496
01:28:06.858 --> 01:28:09.419
(Changed faces.)

1497
01:28:13.397 --> 01:28:14.473
You look familiar...

1498
01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:15.712
How do I save this?

1499
01:28:15.737 --> 01:28:16.737
Save it!

1500
01:28:20.726 --> 01:28:21.860
That's hilarious.

1501
01:28:24.726 --> 01:28:26.224
Don't ever do this hair.

1502
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:29.850
This girl...

1503
01:28:30.267 --> 01:28:32.084
Doesn't she look very picky?

1504
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.759
She's not easy going

1505
01:28:35.085 --> 01:28:36.343
and very adamant.

1506
01:28:36.396 --> 01:28:38.105
But very good at yoga.

1507
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:44.563
And has a very handsome husband.

1508
01:28:45.048 --> 01:28:46.263
Just saying.

1509
01:28:48.186 --> 01:28:52.990
(Working on another piece.)

1510
01:28:53.581 --> 01:28:55.114
I sent you another one.

1511
01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:57.250
More?

1512
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:02.744
(What did I just see...)

1513
01:29:04.529 --> 01:29:06.085
(What did I just see...)

1514
01:29:06.598 --> 01:29:08.535
Who's this old lady?

1515
01:29:09.047 --> 01:29:11.442
(Looks like he's good at Likey dance.)

1516
01:29:11.443 --> 01:29:12.510
That's so funny,

1517
01:29:14.645 --> 01:29:15.672
I'm not that funny.

1518
01:29:15.673 --> 01:29:16.960
I have a beard on my hand!

1519
01:29:16.982 --> 01:29:18.259
I have hair on my forehead!

1520
01:29:21.865 --> 01:29:23.607
(Confused.)

1521
01:29:24.008 --> 01:29:26.085
What if our daughter looks like this...?

1522
01:29:27.017 --> 01:29:28.892
Would our daughter look like this?

1523
01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.193
Imagine if this is our daughter.

1524
01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:35.961
She looks like she can survive anywhere.

1525
01:29:36.215 --> 01:29:37.876
She can survive anywhere.

1526
01:29:38.157 --> 01:29:39.797
I'm going to show this to the guests.

1527
01:29:42.295 --> 01:29:43.295
Guys!

1528
01:29:43.857 --> 01:29:44.864
Can I go upstairs?

1529
01:29:44.944 --> 01:29:45.944
Yes!

1530
01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:48.485
Do you want to see our daughter?

1531
01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.992
(Loss for words...)

1532
01:29:55.558 --> 01:29:56.691
Isn't this crazy?

1533
01:29:58.775 --> 01:29:59.998
You guys look whiter.

1534
01:30:00.167 --> 01:30:01.484
We put some on...

1535
01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.900
Midal, how do I look?

1536
01:30:05.421 --> 01:30:07.350
(You did get whiter.)

1537
01:30:08.494 --> 01:30:09.494
Sun's up.

1538
01:30:10.569 --> 01:30:11.569
Are you guys ready?

1539
01:30:11.598 --> 01:30:12.598
Yes.

1540
01:30:14.065 --> 01:30:16.526
Keep checking the weather.

1541
01:30:16.963 --> 01:30:18.464
If it looks like it'll snow a lot,

1542
01:30:18.465 --> 01:30:19.646
just come back.

1543
01:30:19.706 --> 01:30:21.831
See you later!

1544
01:30:22.055 --> 01:30:23.350
Have fun!

1545
01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:24.459
Be careful!

1546
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:26.750
Be careful.

1547
01:30:26.805 --> 01:30:28.780
(Like a dad seeing his daughters off.)

1548
01:30:29.347 --> 01:30:30.667
This house is like a town.

1549
01:30:30.668 --> 01:30:31.668
Hyo-ri town.

1550
01:30:34.841 --> 01:30:35.841
Again.

1551
01:30:35.961 --> 01:30:37.913
(They're taking selfies.)

1552
01:30:38.198 --> 01:30:39.198
What's pretty?

1553
01:30:39.275 --> 01:30:40.712
You look good in pictures.

1554
01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.237
I don't do anything.

1555
01:30:43.119 --> 01:30:44.532
I'm jealous.

1556
01:30:45.512 --> 01:30:47.949
(Educating his employee.)

1557
01:30:48.438 --> 01:30:50.306
(1. How to open the front gate.)

1558
01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:51.378
Press open.

1559
01:30:52.265 --> 01:30:53.450
Then both gates will open.

1560
01:30:54.418 --> 01:30:56.565
So you have to stop before this gate opens.

1561
01:30:58.035 --> 01:31:00.435
Should we dry the clothes they wore?

1562
01:31:00.714 --> 01:31:01.714
That's right.

1563
01:31:02.258 --> 01:31:03.658
They all put it here.

1564
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:06.015
Wanna learn how to do laundry?

1565
01:31:06.016 --> 01:31:07.016
Yes.

1566
01:31:08.315 --> 01:31:11.624
(2. How to do laundry.)

1567
01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:13.670
You should separate these.

1568
01:31:14.297 --> 01:31:16.364
Use fabric softener for towels.

1569
01:31:16.365 --> 01:31:19.763
(She's very quick to learn.)

1570
01:31:22.865 --> 01:31:23.865
(2. Normal.)

1571
01:31:24.772 --> 01:31:25.772
(3. Dry.)

1572
01:31:27.172 --> 01:31:30.620
(Studying hard at the bed and breakfast.)

1573
01:31:31.848 --> 01:31:35.392
(Meanwhile at the airport.)

1574
01:31:35.818 --> 01:31:39.367
(Snow came to the airport.)

1575
01:31:40.009 --> 01:31:44.609
(Then gets sunny all of a sudden.)

1576
01:31:47.633 --> 01:31:52.061
(A bunch of flights are delayed.)

1577
01:31:53.138 --> 01:31:57.929
(Can the second guests arrive...)

1578
01:31:58.731 --> 01:32:02.789
(Between the clouds far away...)

1579
01:32:03.952 --> 01:32:08.300
(It's here.)

1580
01:32:09.897 --> 01:32:12.766
(Second guest who came through)

1581
01:32:12.767 --> 01:32:14.229
(the blizzard.)

1582
01:32:15.284 --> 01:32:21.290
(Who are they?)

1583
01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:27.888
(What will happen at bed and breakfast...?)

1584
01:32:37.582 --> 01:32:41.712
(Second guests check in.)

1585
01:32:42.038 --> 01:32:43.933
That's a sexy jacket.

1586
01:32:44.584 --> 01:32:47.410
(Hyo-ri certified fashion.)

1587
01:32:47.465 --> 01:32:49.509
That's a nice blouse.

1588
01:32:49.589 --> 01:32:52.123
(While they're checking in...)

1589
01:32:52.124 --> 01:32:53.657
(Another team arrives.)

1590
01:32:54.098 --> 01:32:57.279
(First simultaneous check in.)

1591
01:32:57.369 --> 01:32:59.292
(Chaos.)

1592
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:02.658
(The mood is lifted instantly.)

1593
01:33:03.069 --> 01:33:05.545
(Laughter doesn't stop at the Ger either.)

1594
01:33:06.228 --> 01:33:08.997
(I want to get in there too...)

1595
01:33:08.998 --> 01:33:10.813
(Should I talk to them?)

1596
01:33:11.005 --> 01:33:12.152
Having both men and women

1597
01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:13.468
lifts up the mood.

1598
01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:16.948
(Amicable.)

1599
01:33:17.262 --> 01:33:19.090
They'll be here soon.

1600
01:33:19.871 --> 01:33:23.309
(Snow came instead of guests.)

1601
01:33:24.164 --> 01:33:26.670
(Weather alert in the morning.)

1602
01:33:27.055 --> 01:33:28.831
(If we get stranded...)

1603
01:33:28.832 --> 01:33:30.797
(There's no food!)

1604
01:33:31.317 --> 01:33:33.551
This doesn't work!

1605
01:33:33.853 --> 01:33:35.053
It must be frozen!

1606
01:33:35.733 --> 01:33:36.762
My stomach hurts.

1607
01:33:36.867 --> 01:33:37.867
My back hurts.

1608
01:33:37.961 --> 01:33:39.939
(Hyo-ri's sick?)

1609
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:43.166
We have to close it down.

1610
01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:45.190
