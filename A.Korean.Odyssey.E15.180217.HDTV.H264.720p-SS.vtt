11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200
<i>- He won't die! 
 - He got hurt when you called him, didn't he?</i>

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.580
<i>Stop, Son Oh Gong! Don't!</i>

13

<i>I've entered Sam Jang's body.</i>

28
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.210
- You're awake now? 
 - What did you come here for?

29
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.380
Do I always need you to call me in order to come here? I came because I missed you of course.

30
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.510
You must be really tired. How could you have slept so deeply?

31
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.160
I was dreaming a good dream.

32
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.460
- What dream? 
 - A dream in which I was looking for the thing I wanted most.

33
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.110
Did you find it?

34
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.910
I did. It was great.

35
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.430
You look like you're really happy.

36
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.280
Yeah.

37
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.220
Then keep dreaming a good dream.

38
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.720
Just as the Great Sage said, Ah Sa Nyeo has gone into Sam Jang's body.

39
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.950
Is Sam Jang dead? 
 <i> [Episode 15]</i>

40
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.180
No, that can't be.

41
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.060
Sam Jang's drop of blood in my body is still the same as ever.

42
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.070
She's alive somewhere.

43
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.520
Then she should call Son Oh Gong.

44
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.220
Why isn't she calling him?

45
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.750
Indeed. There's something strange about this.

46
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.470
As long as he's looking for Sam Jang's real self,

47
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.100
can't he not harm Ah Sa Nyeo as she is?

48
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.740
He decided to string her along until he finds a solution so that she doesn't run off with Sam Jang's body.

49
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.890
Will he be able to fool Ah Sa Nyeo?

50
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.560
When she possessed Bu Ja, she had all of Bu Ja's memories.

51
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.440
Ah Sa Nyeo very strongly desired the Great Sage as her wedding partner.

52
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.410
Then she's definitely going to try to go all the way with Son Oh Gong tonight.

53
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.020
You absolutely mustn't break down, Son Oh Gong.

54
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.850
I'm the prettiest in your eyes, right?

55
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.420
You were concerned about that, huh?

56
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.680
What's wrong?

57
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.040
You always worried that I wouldn't find you pretty if the Geumgganggo was taken off.

58
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.590
Your heart would be bothered by it all the way through till the end, wouldn't it?

59
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.960
I'm okay though.

60
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.520
I know you're pretending to be okay with it.

61
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.670
I'm a really bad guy for wanting to hold you even though I know that.

62
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.030
So I'm stopping. Because I love you.

63
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.970
All right. We still have time after all.

64
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.020
We're going to soon be married, aren't we?

65
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.690
- Are we not? 
 - We are.

66
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.880
I'm going to marry my one and only bride in this world.

67
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.990
Let's go out.

68
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.580
<i>Call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger.</i>

69
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.010
<i>I will always appear and protect you.</i>

70
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.220
I'm extremely scared, having a hard time, and in danger right now.

71
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.530
Jin Seon Mi, where are you?

72
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.060
In regards to your decision to get married,

73
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.530
First, I congratulate you.

74
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.850
Leave the food to me.

75
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.380
Thank you everyone.

76
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.140
Ah, this is my wedding ring.

77
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.690
Ah, I see. Yes.

78
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.160
As promised, I selected your wedding dress for you.

79
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.480
Would you like to take a look at it?

80
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.470
Right now? Where is it?

81
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.740
It's in Ma Wang's room.

82
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.140
Sure. I'll go take a look now.

83
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.440
Let's go.

84
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.780
I'll be back after looking at it.

85
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.470
Okay.

86
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.620
Hey, Son Oh Gong. You're being too obvious.

87
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.980
I'm holding myself back.

88
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.440
She really is totally like Sam Jang though. She even smells the same! Right, Ma Wang?

89
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.810
She's even gone so far as to take over all of Sam Jang's spirit energy.

90
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.710
Then again she must have been at least that confident in the takeover,

91
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.380
for her to be able to come here of her own volition.

92
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.270
No. She doesn't feel like Sam Jang at all to me.

93
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.430
Because of the chill Ma Wang is going through the room is a little cold.

94
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.530
Ah, you're right. It is.

95
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.010
Do you like it?

96
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.550
Yes. Can I try it on once?

97
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.730
Go ahead.

98
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.620
It's still here the same as ever.

99
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.640
She's checking on the fake censer.

100
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.430
Good job making another fake censer.

101
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.610
General Winter must have taken the real censer, right?

102
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.010
Geez, it's a real shock that General Winter would betray someone.

103
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.120
The censer's changed to giving off a blue light.

104
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.490
As time passes and the censer's light turns to a blue color,

105
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.600
then that'll mean I've entered Sam Jang's body.

106
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.390
When that happens, break it.

107
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:55.960
If the censer is gone then will Sam Jang be unable to come back again?

108
00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.620
That's right. You have to break the censer for sure.

109
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.890
Find General Winter. We have to find the censer at all costs.

110
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.230
What are we going to do if he's already gotten rid of the censer?

111
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:24.360
If Sam Jang has ended up being completely unable to come back anymore, then Ma Wang will feel it.

112
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.190
She's still safe.

113
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.450
It's in here.

114
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.020
She's still alive.

115
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.030
Hurry.

116
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.620
<i>[I'll come to find you, wait.]</i>

117
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.020
Who was is it that came to my lecture hall?

118
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.840
Was it Jeong Se Ra whom I killed?

119
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.050
<i>What are you doing?</i>

120
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.810
<i>That girl who didn't die and came back.</i>

121
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.510
<i>Hey! Jeong Se Ra. Excuse me, wake up! Hey!</i>

122
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.000
Did the thing that came out of here kill those men?

123
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.330
Sounds like crazy talk, right?

124
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.790
She told me to wait because she was coming to find me.

125
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.080
She's trying to scare me

126
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.550
but I'm really excited by it and looking forward to it.

127
00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:00.260
I feel like something extremely grand is about to show itself in front of this Kang Dae Sung.

128
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:37.540
When Sam Jang is back I'm going to rip Ah Sa Nyeo to shreds.

129
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.570
I can feel your murderous intent all the way over here.

130
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.900
And you're going to have to keep it to yourself until you get Sam Jang back safe and sound.

131
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.790
Isn't that right? Yes, indeed.

132
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.590
I really like the dress.

133
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.150
That's good.

134
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.880
I'm looking forward to it then.

135
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.100
Ah, I'll accompany you on your way out.

136
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.850
Do so please, Oh Jeong.

137
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.720
- Instead of going, I want to stay here tonight. 
 - Pardon?

138
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.890
Secretary Ma left because of Jeo Pal Gye's scheduled event, didn't she?

139
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.780
And Ma Wang is having a hard time because of his eyes right now, so I'll help you.

140
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.570
Oh, yes. I see.

141
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.040
All the better. Then come discuss the preparations for the wedding ceremony with me.

142
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.860
Sure.

143
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.650
See you later.

144
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:49.040
Hey, hey. There's no questioning her mind is set on getting you tonight. What are you going to do?

145
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.920
I've got no other choice.

146
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.120
Ma Wang, sleep with me.

147
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.640
I don't want to.

148
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.310
Tell her you have to sleep holding me tight because of your chill.

149
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.170
Hell no. Hell no to the max.

150
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.220
You can't see anyway! Just think of me as the Princess Iron Fan!

151
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.710
Have you lost it?! No way!

152
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.610
I even took ten hits for you, didn't I!

153
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.990
I don't want to.

154
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.890
- I can't sleep with her! 
 - Ow, ow!

155
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:22.020
Um, the wedding reception will be held in Sureumdong's garden.

156
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.760
If there's any particular food dish that you would like, please tell me.

157
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.010
I already told you everything just now.

158
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.180
I've repeated myself 5 times now!

159
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:36.230
In that case, if there's a particular drink that you like, please tell me.

160
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.120
Decide on it yourself.

161
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.560
I'm going back up now.

162
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.390
Hyungnim, I apologize.

163
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:58.280
This is as far as I can go.

164
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.210
Hey, she's coming. She's coming.

165
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:12.630
Ah! Goodness, the new groom was taking care of his skin but it looks like he's fallen asleep.

166
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.330
<i>[Vaseline]</i>

167
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:21.120
I was going to put one on too. Hold on just a moment.

168
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.320
Son Oh Gong? Nut job?

169
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.990
Oh my, looks like he's deep asleep already. Dear, dear.

170
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:38.020
Sam Jang, I'm truly grateful for you saying you'll stay behind like this to help me.

171
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.930
I'd like it if you could lead me to my room.

172
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.050
Now, now. Come, come.

173
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.920
Thanks, Ma Wang.

174
00:17:55.050 --> 00:18:01.850
Sam Jang, we should talk about this or that regarding your wedding.

175
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.650
Let's do that here.

176
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.440
Come, come. Sit down.

177
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.040
All right. Let's do so then.

178
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.220
What did you want to talk about?

179
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.340
Ah! What would you like for your wedding gift?

180
00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.980
I should give you something valuable.

181
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.790
You're wedding gift was the banana leaf fan, right?

182
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.550
Give me something as valuable as that.

183
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.550
Elder Soo Bo Ri has the banana leaf fan right now.

184
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:41.050
He'll return it after I become a deity.

185
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:46.590
Even though it's yours, you have to wait obediently for it to be given back to you?

186
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.860
For the sake of lessening my woman's pain,

187
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.060
I'm waiting nice and obediently.

188
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.720
I see the heavenly realm was able to quite easily tame you because of the suffering they inflicted on her.

189
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.440
You're submissively obedient and you've even gotten weak.

190
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.580
How bad for you.

191
00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.540
I've gotten quite weak, haven't I?

192
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.260
The best treatment for it is right in front of my eyes though.

193
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:38.290
Wouldn't I become strong again if I just gobbled that up? Hm?

194
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.960
Come out.

195
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.800
I said come out of there.

196
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.860
I'm leaving.

197
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.600
She probably caught on.

198
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.050
Catch her before she runs away.

199
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.120
I've been tamed, you say?

200
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.140
Wait!

201
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.410
Like I thought, you've been deceiving me.

202
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.220
I should have put up with it longer,

203
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.480
but I dislike you a pretty great deal.

204
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:15.860
What do you think you're going to do to me when you can't even hurt me?

205
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.630
Where's Sam Jang?

206
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.620
I'm Sam Jang. She's gone.

207
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.760
She's been buried in my place in the sarcophagus I was locked up in.

208
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.210
That girl is dead.

209
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.580
Son Oh Gong!

210
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.680
She's still in me. She's definitely still alive!

211
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.390
Let her go.

212
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:37.530
If you act like this towards me again, I'll make it so that this girl gets devoured by evil spirits.

213
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.220
You think I won't be able to?

214
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.080
Shall I try shedding some blood right here and now?

215
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.660
She might even end up being gobbled up by Ma Wang.

216
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.760
Should I give it a try?

217
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.030
Don't do it.

218
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:04.380
I can't beat you with my own strength.

219
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:13.560
However, I can cut up this one little body.

220
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.650
I committed a wrong.

221
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.260
Don't be like this. Don't hurt her.

222
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.240
We're getting married as planned.

223
00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.790
A marriage is a contract.

224
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.210
I'm going to become your bride.

225
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.830
And from then on you're going to be next to me.

226
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:56.870
Depending on how you act, I may even wake up that girl from the coffin for you.

227
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:03.130
After 100 years? 500 years? Will you be able to love me until then?

228
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:10.270
Who's to say? I don't know how long it will last,

229
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.700
but when it ends you'll die.

230
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:20.000
Then I guess I'll have to keep a hold on you for a good 1,000 years then.

231
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.200
Bye, now.

232
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.080
It's not going to take 1,000 years like it did for me.

233
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.930
We just need to find General Winter. You withstood it well.

234
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:48.180
Ma Wang, you felt like this for 1,000 years?

235
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.470
That's right. I couldn't do anything

236
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.580
and I endured the agony of not even knowing where or how she was.

237
00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.190
That's how my 1,000 years were.

238
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.270
I can't even bear it for just one day.

239
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.600
I'm going to find General Winter.

240
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:21.280
That stone-head monkey is feeling true pain now.

241
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.550
The punishment this heavenly realm inflicted upon him was quite the success.

242
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.850
This isn't good for you either, huh?

243
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.900
I'm sorry.

244
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.000
She told me to get rid of this censer...

245
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.520
Are you really going to go through with the wedding?

246
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.110
Until I find General Winter, I have to do as she says.

247
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:02.690
Then I guess I won't need to get rid of the things I prepared.

248
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.160
What things?

249
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.350
Wow

250
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.010
You prepared it so well it's hurting my heart.

251
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.190
I apologize, Hyungnim.

252
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.360
No, you did good. Sam Jang will really like it when she sees it.

253
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.870
Oh Jeong, you should get going to work already. I'm going to go to that girl.

254
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.560
What are you going to do there?

255
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.110
What else? I have to pick on her of course. She's in a good mood.

256
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:59.180
As expected, since the necklace by itself was originally pretty it makes you prettier when you wear it.

257
00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.250
From here to here.

258
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.760
Yes, Ma'am.

259
00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.370
And from there to there.

260
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.580
I'll also wrap up the clothes and shoes you came here in, Ma'am.

261
00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.420
Just throw them away.

262
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.310
Yes, Ma'am. Is there anything else you need?

263
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.460
What do you think of these?

264
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.460
These aren't that great.

265
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.320
Right? To my eyes as well they looked a little big.

266
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.030
Those red ones over there.

267
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:39.610
Ah, yes, understood. I'll get you a new pair.

268
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.500
Thank you so much for your business, Ma'am. Would you like to pay by card?

269
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.300
I'm just going to take them with me and leave.

270
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.450
Yes, please just leave.

271
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.590
Ma'am! Just one moment please! Wait, please!

272
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.040
You need to pay before you go.

273
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.550
- You told me I could just leave. 
 - Excuse me?

274
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.200
You have to pay and then you can leave.

275
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.460
I said I'm leaving.

276
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.390
As I keep saying, quickly pay up and then leave.

277
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.490
I don't have any money though.

278
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.960
If you don't have money then just give them here.

279
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.900
A person that's all talk.

280
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.110
Where do you think you're going?

281
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.760
Take it all off, please.

282
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.300
Fine. Give me my clothes.

283
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.970
You told us to throw them away earlier, didn't you? They're in the trash can over there.

284
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.890
Was this your doing?

285
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.380
Why were you putting on those lousy clothes? Like yourself.

286
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.950
Even when Jin Seon Mi was dressed in rags she looked pretty.

287
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680
As for you...

288
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.010
I'm pretty sure I told you not to threaten me.

289
00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.950
I'm not, I'm not.

290
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.910
I'm just watching you because you're pretty.

291
00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.540
I'm pretty?

292
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.280
You're not pretty! I lied.

293
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.270
Geez, you fell for that? You're really easy.

294
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.460
I didn't fall for it.

295
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.420
No, no. You fell for it and you're going to continue to fall for it. You said you like me.

296
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.560
You said you wanted me.

297
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.980
Shall I give myself to you?

298
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.800
I'm not going to! I lied! Just look at you! You fell for it again!

299
00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.000
What are you doing?

300
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:05.860
I need to get to know you since we're going to be married.

301
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.430
I figured that through this kind of amity,

302
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:13.060
a bad guy and bad girl could be able to live well together,

303
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.660
Do you think I'm lying?

304
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.420
Do you think I'm trying to fool you? Should I not get to know you?

305
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.460
Continuing doing so. I'm fine with it.

306
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.300
What should I do? I'll try becoming someone that you'll like.

307
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.890
Is that so?

308
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.800
Then let's go to work.

309
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.690
The real-estate office? Why would I go there?

310
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:38.790
You're going to because I'm going there.

311

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.930
Even when she was busy catching evil spirits, she always came to work on time and did her job.

313
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.990
Do you think you'll be able to as well?

314
00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.740
All of this body's memories

315
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.550
are still here.

316
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.190
Even the little details.

317
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:12.460
If you want me to, I can be exactly like that girl.

318
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.150
Exactly the same?

319
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.050
Son Oh Gong, normal office workers are busy at this hour.

320
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.460
Don't try any funny business and get out.

321
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.930
Hey, that really was really good. Keep going.

322
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:32.170
I'm starting to like you more and more.

323
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.560
Give me a break when I'm starting to like you.

324
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.390
Do you want me to continue?

325
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.300
All right. If you keep doing it so well like that,

326
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.550
I'll fall for it in the blink of an eye.

327
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.550
I can do it. In the end,

328
00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.020
I'll be able to fool even your heart.

329
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.050
Deceiving and being deceived.

330
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:10.030
Like that we can live well.

331
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.470
You know that well.

332
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.280
Now it's up to you. Do a good job being the exact same.

333
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.420
Depending on how you do, I'll let myself be fooled.

334
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.970
Good luck!

335
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.940
CEO, good morning!

336
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.040
What is it? Does something look different?

337
00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.260
Why are coming to work dirty like that? There's something on your collar.

338
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.370
Wipe it off.

339
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.710
Thank you.

340
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.570
You're going to have to really hang in there today. We're super busy.

341
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:16.230
It'll be fine. I can do it.

342
00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:30.960
CEO! How could you stamp the seal like that! I'm already busy enough I could die!

343
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.900
Now I have to draw this up again!

344
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.370
I know it all in my head. It's just because it's my first time doing it!

345
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:46.150
Are you speaking words right now or passing wind? CEO, you've been doing this work for 10 years, 3 with me.

346
00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.040
I can do it well!

347
00:33:55.070 --> 00:34:00.020
Don't just say empty words! Use your eyes and properly look before doing it!

348
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.700
And tie your hair back. It keeps getting on me.

349
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.970
I have re-draft all of these again. Ahh, the stress...

350
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:16.010
What a pain.

351
00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.590
CEO, your family is here.

352
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.490
Huh? Family?

353
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.170
Secretary Son must have contacted them to say you're getting married.

354
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.930
We've got good news too. A second baby is on the way.

355
00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:51.000
Help us out with some money.

356
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.960
Seon Mi, congratulations!

357
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.180
He said Secretary Son contacted him to tell him you were getting married.

358
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.160
Congrats on your happy ending. Come here!

359
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.100
- Okay! 
 - Okay?

360
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.010
Drinks on me!

361
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:24.250
Oh, yeah! Party! I missed you! I missed you!

362
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:28.150
- Party! Drinking party! 
 - Party!

363
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.530
What now?

364
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:38.160
Uh, well, the boiler at our home exploded all of a sudden.

365
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.260
Secretary Son told us to come stay here. Thank you.

366
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.590
Auntie!

367
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.610
Hey, you're going to make your mom sad.

368
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.200
Let's go. Let's go.

369
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.390
Haphazardly searching for him is taking too much time.

370
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.750
No matter how much we call General Winter, he won't respond.

371
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.810
If he was intending to betray me then of course he wouldn't come when called.

372
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.630
What about the Summer Fairy?

373
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.290
Summer Fairy was here when the censer disappeared.

374
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.180
As I thought, did those two plan this?

375
00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:16.270
But something's still off. Why did they have to go out of their way to have General Winter return to his body,

376
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.070
make the censer out of ice, and then leave.

377
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:23.190
Summer Fairy should have been more than capable of doing that much,

378
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.320
You're saying General Winter put Summer Fairy asleep and did it by himself?

379
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.560
Ah, when I first saw Summer Fairy

380
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.290
it was definitely warm. However,

381
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.030
that night it got cold again.

382
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.780
I thought it was because of my chill but there's no doubt

383
00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.980
General Winter came and took it away,.

384
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.590
That makes sense.

385
00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.600
Why are you awake at night, General Winter?

386
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.950
On the night it was taken away, General Winter was awake.

387
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.860
And the one that Ah Sa Nyeo met with was General Winter.

388
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:01.120
Is it possible Summer Fairy has nothing to do with this?

389
00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.760
If Summer Fairy really has nothing to do with this,

390
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.970
then we need to try calling her.

391
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.120
If General Winter's been awake all this time

392
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.000
then he should be really exhausted right now.

393
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.880
Summer Fairy, don't come out.

394
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.410
<i>Brother, stop it now.</i>

395
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:39.670
Don't come out. Just stay asleep.

396
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.570
You're going to destroy this place?

397
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:50.310
Yeah. I need to call Summer Fairy out.

398
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:23.020
Come. If you don't want to die,

399
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.740
then come!

400
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.830
<i>He's calling me.</i>

401
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:36.620
Don't answer him. Just stay obediently inside me.

402
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.070
<i>I have to go!</i>

403
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:50.390
You can't! What are you doing!

404
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.890
Brother

405
00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:08.100
No. If you come out from my body you'll soon disappear.

406
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.050
Come back.

407
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.430
Don't!

408
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:41.050
Please, stop now!

409
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.170
It's Summer Fairy!

410
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.140
I'm here.

411
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.810
- You came out of General Winter's body? 
 - Yes.

412
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:59.830
This is a place I cherished. Please don't destroy it.

413
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.850
You liked this place as well, didn't you, Great Sage?

414
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:09.950
Even though you couldn't drink.

415
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:15.500
Where's General Winter? What about the censer?

416
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.490
Summer Fairy's soul came out of General Winter.

417
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.790
We've found out where he is.

418
00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:30.630
Son Oh Gong is going to kill General Winter.

419
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:40.140
I have to find Ah Sa Nyeo and have her put Summer Fairy's soul back in me.

420
00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:49.630
Great Sage

421
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.950
Hand over the censer.

422
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.690
I can't do that.

423
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.880
General Winter!

424
00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.950
Sam Jang is a human that can harm you, Great Sage!

425
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.310
Getting rid of the censer is not considered betraying you.

426
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:12.190
Sam Jang is the person that will be my bride.

427
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:17.440
I need that censer to find my bride.

428
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.980
Don't come near. I need to protect my sister as well.

429
00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:12.540
I didn't want to kill you.

430
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.360
Stop, Brother!

431
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.950
Brother

432
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:52.580
You musn't! Don't hold me!

433
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.830
Go back in me!

434
00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:09.050
I should have disappeared back then.

435
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:14.430
Thanks to you Brother, until now

436
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.070
I've been able to live a good and enjoyable life.

437
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.570
Now I'm going to leave.

438
00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:26.920
No! You can't!

439
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.890
You can't.

440
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:35.570
Great Sage, please forgive him.

441
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:43.340
My death should be enough to pay the price for the crime.

442
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.620
My sister! My pretty sister!

443
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 The Monkey Minions @ Viki</i>

444
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.910
My sister!

445
00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:58.120
<i>I'm sorry. Good-bye.</i>

446
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.500
Ma Wang, have your eyes gotten better?

447
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:29.650
I think I've received the Summer Fairy's last gift.

448
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:36.080
Thanks to that heat wave just now, my chill has gone away.

449
00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.140
That's great.

450
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:55.390
When she put my sister's soul in me, I made a contract with Ah Sa Nyeo.

451
00:45:55.390 --> 00:46:02.280
Now that my sister's soul is gone, that contract has also ended.

452
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:11.760
Sam Jang should also still be alive so kill me

453
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.790
and go and save her.

454
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.670
Summer Fairy took on the price of your betrayal.

455
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.700
General Winter, stop crying.

456
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.140
You keep making it cold and snow.

457
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.790
I hate the cold.

458
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.140
I'm sorry.

459
00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:56.320
Excuse me, CEO.  The boiler still is not fixed.

460
00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.980
Once it's fixed, we'll leave.

461
00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.830
I can do it.

462
00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:02.100
Yes, I can!

463
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.230
If you look at scary things at night you'll pee yourself.

464
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:16.530
Oh? It's Professor Kang Dae Sung.

465
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.630
Whenever I look at this guy

466
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:37.230
he's always handsome and cool.

467
00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.790
Han Byeol, you need to study hard as well

468
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.540
so that you can become a great person like this ahjussi.

469
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.300
He's not that great of a person.

470
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.890
A priestess that can crown a king?

471
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.560
Who are you?

472
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:56.970
I've come here to get Jin Seon Mi. Son Oh Gong called me here.

473
00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:59.690
Ah, Secretary Son? Okay. Come on in.

474
00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:01.590
I'm on my way out.

475
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.600
Han Byeol! Han Sol! If your things are all packed then let's go!

476
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:11.070
Is he Secretary Son's father?

477
00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:14.990
He seems familiar...

478
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.110
Oh! That's it!

479
00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:22.760
That's it!

480
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.690
How can this be? A company president's son?

481
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.940
Oh. My. God.

482
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.600
He told me to bring you to Sureumdong.

483
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:48.910
- You're pretty. 
 - I'm not going to fall for that.

484
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:53.360
By the way, what is all this?

485
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.880
Did you go so far as to prepare all this just to fool me?

486
00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.930
Oh Jeong prepared all of it.

487
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.670
Don't like it. Since it's not for you.

488
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.610
- Then get rid of it. 
 - I wont.

489
00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:08.080
I can still use it with you, can't I?

490
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.360
We're getting married, aren't we?

491
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.950
Drink up.

492
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:29.850
You think I'd drink this?

493
00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.530
I know all about what you did to Ma Wang.

494
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:36.990
Is that so? This is a really good wine though.

495
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.790
Don't light those either.

496
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:51.510
These smell really good though. They're perfect for setting the mood.

497
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:56.090
Don't do anything. I'm not going to fall for it.

498
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:09.580
I didn't call you here to not do anything though.

499
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.790
All right. I won't do anything.

500
00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.460
Then talk about yourself.

501
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.620
Why did you want to become Sam Jang so badly?

502
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.020
I doubt it was because you wanted to become the CEO of Hanbit Real Estate.

503
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:43.730
In this new lifetime, I'm going to call a dragon again.

504
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:48.360
- What? 
 - And by doing so I'll crown a king.

505
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:55.640
If you protect me by my side, I can do anything.

506
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.800
Ah Sa Nyeo and Sam Jang's dreams are connected with this censer.

507
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:13.430
As long as Sam Jang is sleeping, she'll be in that dream.

508
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:18.110
Then if Ah Sa Nyeo re-enters that dream, they'll be able to switch and we can get her out?

509
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:22.760
Yes. She has to be put to sleep first.

510
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.010
Ah Sa Nyeo is on her guard right now,

511
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:31.600
she'll never let herself fall asleep next to Son Oh Gong.

512
00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:41.540
I'll become the Sam Jang that you loved. I can be the exact same as her.

513
00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:47.590
You just need to stay by my side just as you are now.

514
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:53.000
Then what are you going to do for me?

515
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:58.410
I'll end that death bell fate.

516
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:02.920
So that's what it was. The reason Sam Jang isn't calling me.

517
00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:08.970
She was under such an absurd misconception so I told her the proper truth.

518
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:15.450
That you and she aren't this kind of match made in heaven.

519
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:31.760
If she comes back it's possible you'll die.

520
00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:36.330
But even so, are you going to continue to wait for her?

521
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.770
No, I'm not going to wait.

522
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.510
You've made the right choice.

523
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:45.380
There's a lot of different ways to make a person take a drug.

524
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.730
What did you just give me?

525
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:50.320
A drug to make you dream a good dream.

526
00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.490
I put it in the water I drank earlier.

527
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:59.030
You were talking so much I almost ate it all myself.

528
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.360
Have a nice dream.

529
00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:07.560
And,  I'm going to make it so that you can never wake back up in this body.

530
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:22.590
- Did you put her to sleep? 
 - Yeah.

531
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:26.510
How? It shouldn't have been easy.

532
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:30.960
Don't ask me how. The censer is burning well right?

533
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.890
Yes.

534
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:40.290
Ah Sa Nyeo and Sam Jang's dreams should be connected.

535
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.280
I have to go there.

536
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:54.760
Is there a way to enter that dream?

537
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.510
You can't go into someone else's dream without any connection to it.

538
00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:02.680
I have a connection.

539
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.530
It will tell me where she is.

540
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:47.540
Jin Seon Mi, where are you right now?

541
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:51.940
Can you hear my voice?

542
00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.790
Jin Seon Mi, where are you?

543
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.680
Jin Seon Mi!

544
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:27.440
I came back here?

545
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:39.680
If I put out the censer the two of them will be able to come out of the dream.

546
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:13.690
Has the censer's flame been put out?

547
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:49.170
She's gone.

548
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:54.850
We've been disconnected.

549
01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.140
I came to see you in your dream.

550
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:12.580
And Son Oh Gong should have gone to Sam Jang's dream.

551
01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:25.650
Jin Seon Mi

552
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.990
I received a big help from you so I didn't particularly have an issue with you. However,

553
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:52.730
you keep causing problems so I 'm left with no other choice.

554
01:00:52.730 --> 01:01:01.950
You're going to have to go back into this coffin and sleep like a good girl.

555
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.030
- Just a moment 
 - No.

556
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.960
I don't feel like listening to your stories anymore.

557
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.400
You're being deceived by something, Ma Wang.

558
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.480
You're the one that would be deceiving me!

559
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.010
Do you think Princess Iron Fan's child really died?

560
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.020
Why didn't you call me?

561
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.890
Why are you here? Get out!

562
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.420
Don't come here! Don't come, Son Oh Gong!

563
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:54.590
I knew it. Because of me you're hurting and are going to die.

564
01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:00.910
She said it was a death bell!

565
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:05.160
It's horrifying. I'm not leaving from here.

566
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.750
I told you not to come near me!

567
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.720
Fine. Then try and kill me right here and now.

568
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.490
Son Oh Gong!

569
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.940
I'm begging you don't come.

570
01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:38.360
Don't make me hurt you.

571
01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.020
You told me,

572
01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:46.660
when I'm scared, having a hard time, or in danger you would protect me.

573
01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:02.710
<i>I've got one of these now too</i>

574
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:07.020
<i>So when you're scared, having a hard time, or in danger call my name.</i>

575
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.750
<i>I'll always run to your side and protect you.</i> 
♫ <i>I will close my two eyes</i> ♫

576
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:16.400
♫ <i>So that I won't see you</i> ♫

577
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:24.180
♫ <i>Even though it's painful, I'm not going to hurt</i> ♫

578
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.190
Jin Seon Mi  
 ♫ <i>And I'll grit my teeth like this</i> ♫

579
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:31.070
Jin Seong Mi.

 </i> ♫

580
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.500
Jin Seon Mi! 
 ♫ <i> Don't worry</i> ♫

581
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:42.070
♫ <i>Please just go the way you were going</i> ♫

582
01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:49.470
♫ <i>I'm fine. I'm used to seeing you leave</i> ♫

583

584
01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:06.670

585
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:14.320

589
01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.330
You're awake.

590
01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:51.350
Thank goodness.

591
01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.590
You're okay?

592
01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:57.300
Yeah.

593
01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:04.590
I finally found my bride,

594
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:09.820
but I'm so sleepy right now.

595
01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:40.000
I'm sorry.

596
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.920
It's Ah Sa Nyeo's censer.

597
01:05:56.730 --> 01:06:00.690
As always, you're the only one I can count on Ma Wang.

598
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:09.560
Yes, of course. I do things very obediently, don't I?

599
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:14.850
Did you do a good job taking care of Ah Sa Nyeo?

600
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:18.080
I lost her.

601
01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:23.820
I've gotten very weak you see.

602
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.870
Bu Ja won't be able to wake up for eternity, will she?

603
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:39.760
When Ma Wang comes he's going to burn her.

604
01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.810
You're awake?!

605
01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.670
Bu Ja!

606
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.950
Jeo Pal Gye

607
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.010
please save me.

608
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.450
Ah, we're going to leave first.

609
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:18.960
Why is he just leaving without staying to watch Bu Ja get burned?

610
01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.910
What's the meaning of this?

611
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:51.760
The pig ran off with Bu Ja.

612
01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.500
Jeo Pal Gye's at it again!

613
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.540
Why are you getting off? You said you wanted to see your mom!

614
01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.860
I changed my mind.

615
01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:45.430
Thank you for helping me.

616
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.690
You tricked me again, didn't you? You're just Ah Sa Nyeo, aren't you?

617
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:57.780
And so? Are you going to drag me back to be burned?

618
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:10.380
Don't come out and stay hidden. Don't let yourself get caught.

619
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:16.050
You really did love and cherish her.

620
01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.020
Leave.

621
01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.320
It's a good thing I was able to use him.

622
01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.790
Shall I go to the other one now?

623
01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:43.080
As promised, I came to find you.

624
01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:47.790
I was waiting for you.

625
01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.800
Pal Gye let Ah Sa Nyeo free.

626
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.930
I apologize.

627
01:10:56.990 --> 01:11:01.420
It's fine. Leave her be.

628
01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:15.700
I realized something huge thanks to her.

629
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.350
Do you think Princess Iron Fan's child died?

630
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:24.810
The child died.

631
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:29.990
A child that was born of a deity and a demon and consumed the souls of tens of human children,

632
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:32.610
do you think it really would have died?

633
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:38.090
What are you trying to say right now?

634
01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:42.980
Because the child died, the woman committed a crime.

635
01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:48.960
And in order to end the punishment for that, you lived a quiet and obedient life for 1,000 years.

636
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.770
Try thinking about it in reverse.

637
01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:57.030
And if that makes sense to you, let me go.

638
01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.740
In order to make me tame and obedient, that woman committed a crime.

639
01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.420
And for the sake of that crime,

640
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:08.190
my child was killed.

641
01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:16.000
Why did I never think of that before?

642
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.430
Don't fall too hard for what Ah Sa Nyeo tells you.

643
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.650
If I was actually deceived, then they're all my enemies.

644
01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.760
The bride has been found

645
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:36.550
and the groom keeps sleeping.

646
01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:42.690
Great Sage, peer of heaven,

647
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:47.880
Son Oh Gong, Human Jin Seon Mi

648
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.560
loves you.

649
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.230
And now

650
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:02.760
I'm going to end your love.

651
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:13.010
