1
00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.424
This is the qualification match
for the PyeongChang Olympics.

2
00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.217
A very important race, wouldn't you say?

3
00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:37.591
Park Eun-ho and Mo Pil-tae, ranking
1st and 2nd internationally,

4
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.133
are competing in this race.

5
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.716
And they are both here to win.

6
00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.883
Who will end up proceeding to the Olympics?

7
00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:45.883
Or will they both qualify?

8
00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:47.217
I can't wait to see what happens.

9
00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.883
That's right.

10
00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:49.716
Oh, and the rink right next to
where we are at is

11
00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.183
hosting another competition, right?

12
00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:55.175
Yes. An amateur competition to celebrate
the PyeongChang hosting is

13
00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:57.883
happening right next door as we speak.

14
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.541
2 million won for the grand prize?

15
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.883
Are you serious?

16
00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.517
What are you going to do with that money?

17
00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:20.967
I've got plans, man.

18
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:35.041
Are you ready?

19
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.900
All skaters are at the starting line now.

20
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:04.101
Ready.

21
00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.050
We've got Park Eun-ho and Mo Pil-tae

22
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.908
in a fierce competition right now!

23
00:02:15.908 --> 00:02:18.183
And there's Park
coming in through the corner!

24
00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:20.050
Accelerating on a straight path is

25
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.666
Park's forte as well.

26
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.483
I can't wait to see who wins today.

27
00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:27.508
The chance to compete
at the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics!

28
00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:29.025
Who will seize this honor?

29
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:30.967
Only one lap remaining!

30
00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:34.083
What a fierce competition!

31
00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:23.375
Yes?

32
00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.966
I thought I should check on the race

33
00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:26.433
before heading back up.

34
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.317
Yes, I watched Park Eun-ho's race.

35
00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:31.275
The outcome?

36
00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:33.383
Check for yourself.

37
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:25.683
Dad

38
00:05:55.183 --> 00:05:57.050
You idiot!

39
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.116
All that injury
just to win the second place?

40
00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:12.917
Don't let the victory get to your head.

41
00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:15.016
Prepare for the next training.

42
00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:29.100
Oh! What just happened?

43
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.183
A fatal mistake from Park Eun-ho!

44
00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.683
He just couldn't beat that speed.

45
00:06:32.724 --> 00:06:35.391
The victory goes to Mo Pil-tae.

46
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.850
- Mo Pil-tae.
- Yes.

47
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.508
After a tough competition with your rival
Park Eun-ho,

48
00:06:39.508 --> 00:06:40.767
you finally came out on top.

49
00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:43.108
How do you feel?

50
00:06:43.108 --> 00:06:46.050
It was even tougher than I had expected.

51
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.517
Sorry!

52
00:06:47.517 --> 00:06:49.475
But I put so much training into this

53
00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:52.316
that I was sure I was going to win today.

54
00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:55.201
And I'm really happy that I did.

55
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:04.850
Get out.

56
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:18.067
I said get out. Are you deaf?

57
00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:22.583
You get out!

58
00:07:23.308 --> 00:07:25.100
I actually have to finish quickly too.

59
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.650
What did you say?

60
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.283
Do you know who I am?

61
00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:34.492
Should I?

62
00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:36.392
Here we have today's amateur winner,

63
00:07:36.392 --> 00:07:37.950
Kang Ho-young.

64
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.759
Good to have you with us.

65
00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.575
Hello.

66
00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:44.733
Pretty scary speed for an amateur skater

67
00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:46.016
that we saw in your acceleration today.

68
00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:47.033
Can you tell us how you are feeling?

69
00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:50.016
Well, I… just enjoyed it.

70
00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.017
- You have the potential to be more than just an amateur.
- That's a good way to wreck yourself.

71
00:07:54.017 --> 00:07:56.583
Do you train regularly?

72
00:07:56.583 --> 00:08:01.241
- I wouldn't call it training. I just like ice.
- Better than an ex-champion who's just a loser now.

73
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:05.375
- It's more like playing with ice. Like it's my friend, you know?
-What was that?

74
00:08:07.183 --> 00:08:09.183
You just heard it from a lover of ice.

75
00:08:09.183 --> 00:08:12.383
Kang Ho-young,
the amateur skater.

76
00:08:19.183 --> 00:08:21.325
I'm in a good mood today,
so I'll let you slide.

77
00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:23.583
Turn off the light on your way out.

78
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.941
How can you mess up a race this important?

79
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.033
What in the world were you thinking?

80
00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:37.941
Huh?

81
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:39.783
What were you thinking,

82
00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:42.233
making a stupid mistake like that?

83
00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:44.783
Um… Sir?

84
00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:48.108
I'm sure Eun-ho is regretting it as well.

85
00:08:48.108 --> 00:08:52.142
We'll get him a good coach,
and once he starts training properly,

86
00:08:52.142 --> 00:08:54.766
he can aim for the next qualification race.

87
00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:59.283
I'm quitting sports.

88
00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:02.283
What?

89
00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:05.283
What did you just say?

90
00:09:05.283 --> 00:09:07.500
Quit what?

91
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.783
I'm sure you were hearing things.

92
00:09:08.783 --> 00:09:09.683
No, wait… he just slipped his tongue.

93
00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:13.600
He just suffered an unexpected loss.

94
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.700
He's probably just not himself right now.

95
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.611
Get inside.
Come on, get inside.

96
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:22.611
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:28.150
Ow! What was that?

98
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.683
Who told you to worry about
something like that?

99
00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:35.550
You can use that time to study!
Get a certificate or something!

100
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.216
When will you stop playing on ice?

101
00:09:39.216 --> 00:09:41.550
Who's playing?
I'm working out there.

102
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.850
I skate fast, they give me prize money.
That's good, right?

103
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.800
You can stand here
sharpening skates all day, grandpa.

104
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.650
I just brought home more money than you.

105
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.316
You can use it to fix the boiler.

106
00:09:51.316 --> 00:09:56.050
Like I said!
You don't need to worry about it!

107
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.816
I'm cold too!

108
00:09:57.816 --> 00:10:00.116
It's so cold at home
I'm always shivering!

109
00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:01.316
You idiot!

110
00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:04.542
I'll take care of the boiler!

111
00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:06.617
You just worry about taking classes

112
00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:10.417
and getting some certificates!

113
00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:13.383
What certificates?
I'm not studying anything!

114
00:10:13.383 --> 00:10:16.883
- You can study all you want.
- Why, you!

115
00:10:20.383 --> 00:10:22.133
Are you Kang Ho-young?

116
00:10:22.983 --> 00:10:24.483
Who are you?

117
00:10:24.483 --> 00:10:26.917
He probably just said it out of anger.

118
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:29.950
There's no way he's quitting for real.

119
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.041
When is Coach Son joining us?

120
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:35.716
He'll join us the day after tomorrow.

121
00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:41.500
Watch Eun-ho.
Make sure he doesn't get any funny ideas.

122
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.200
Yes, of course!

123
00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:52.366
Eun-ho!
I understand you are frustrated right now.

124
00:11:52.366 --> 00:11:57.658
But we have a meeting with Coach Son
tomorrow at noon.

125
00:11:57.658 --> 00:12:02.917
Get some rest today.
See you at the training center tomorrow.

126
00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:06.358
Are we good?

127
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:23.800
Not going. Nope.

128
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.183
Was he really this fast?

129
00:12:27.183 --> 00:12:29.908
With skills like his, there is a chance.

130
00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:32.275
Your lap time yesterday was actually

131
00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:35.075
an unofficial tie to the world record.

132
00:12:35.075 --> 00:12:37.333
Like I said, I'm not going.

133
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:39.350
Why not?

134
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.125
When are you going to get
another chance like this?

135
00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:44.483
Well I'm not budging.

136
00:12:44.483 --> 00:12:46.433
I like it here better.

137
00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:49.583
May I ask why?

138
00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:53.366
We have cleaner air here than in Seoul,
for starters…

139
00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:55.316
I can skate here better,

140
00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.591
I have my part time job here…

141
00:12:57.591 --> 00:13:00.059
Idiot! Who cares about the part time job?

142
00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:02.558
It's important!

143
00:13:02.558 --> 00:13:04.611
And also…

144
00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:08.711
you are going to be all alone if I go.

145
00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:15.008
I'd be more comfortable without you. Go!

146
00:13:16.108 --> 00:13:18.792
Listen to me.
You bring your skates here every day,

147
00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:21.183
just to work at a skating rink.

148
00:13:21.183 --> 00:13:23.940
They'll let you just skate all day!
What's not to like?

149
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.758
Just let me be, grandpa!

150
00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:28.259
Just shut up and go!

151
00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:31.350
Nope. I'm not going.

152
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.583
You are going! No ifs, ands, or buts!

153
00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:38.650
So what's going to happen
if he goes to Seoul?

154
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.442
We'll test him first.

155
00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:41.416
If he passes,

156
00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:44.000
he'll be accepted to a sport university
via special admission.

157
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.542
We'll train him from then on.
His tuition and housing will be on us.

158
00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:49.240
I'll make it happen no matter what.

159
00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:53.358
And if things don't go well,

160
00:13:53.358 --> 00:13:56.040
will you send him back
to this backwater town?

161
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.325
Oh, no.

162
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.133
We'll make him a pro athlete.

163
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:03.908
He'll be racing in
international competitions.

164
00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:08.083
And even the Olympics.

165
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.683
You'll be skating all you want.

166
00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:23.140
Why would you say no?

167
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.717
They'll even put you through a college!

168
00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:31.240
I was worried you'd waste your life away
after high school.

169
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.742
Everything worked out for the best!

170
00:14:32.742 --> 00:14:35.558
I don't know.
I'm not interested in colleges.

171
00:14:35.558 --> 00:14:38.633
I'm just going to stay here with you…

172
00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:42.583
- You idiot!
- What is it now?

173
00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:47.708
Don't you have any of that…
What's the word?

174
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:49.040
What? You mean ambition?

175
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.900
Yeah! Ambition!

176
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.750
If you skate well, then…
What's the word?

177
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.841
Those people representing the country…

178
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:01.416
You mean a national athlete?

179
00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:05.358
Yeah! They'll make you a national athlete!

180
00:15:05.358 --> 00:15:07.733
This is exactly why I can't go.

181
00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:08.900
It's not just the words you forget.

182
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.542
You always forget to turn off the stove!

183
00:15:11.542 --> 00:15:13.542
You always forget to lock the store!

184
00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:15.917
Pretty soon, you'll forget to eat, too.

185
00:15:15.917 --> 00:15:19.991
So how can I just leave you here alone?

186
00:15:19.991 --> 00:15:24.150
Why, you!
If I just focus a little,

187
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:29.508
I can remember everything just fine!

188
00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:35.833
Who do you think you are?
Bringing up my… what's was it…

189
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.808
What? What?

190
00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:38.567
Fault!

191
00:15:38.567 --> 00:15:42.750
Yeah!
You are bringing up your grandpa's faults!

192
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.124
Sheesh… Listen to me.

193
00:15:47.124 --> 00:15:53.633
I'm asking you to make my life easier, too.

194
00:15:53.633 --> 00:15:59.491
A medal-winning grandson!
How proud would I be?

195
00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:04.933
And go win an Olympic medal
while you're at it.

196
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.942
You know what that means?

197
00:16:07.942 --> 00:16:12.275
The government pays you pension
until you die!

198
00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:15.266
Seriously?

199
00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:17.350
That's right!

200
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.275
So go out there and train hard!

201
00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:24.491
And also… it was your dad's dream.

202
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:28.583
It'd be grand if his boy
realized it for him!

203
00:16:36.792 --> 00:16:38.800
What are you doing?

204
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.967
Hey, grandpa.
How about a piggyback ride?

205
00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:42.667
Hop on!

206
00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:44.508
Get out of here!

207
00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:47.781
Come on!

208
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.750
- Hey, grandpa?
- What?

209
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.716
I'm going to Seoul.
I'll become a national athlete.

210
00:17:00.716 --> 00:17:02.308
I'd like to see that.

211
00:17:02.308 --> 00:17:05.311
I guess I better live long, then.

212
00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.433
- Go home!
- What the heck?

213
00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:13.441
What did I do?

214
00:17:13.441 --> 00:17:14.250
Leave!

215
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.275
Leave!

216
00:17:15.275 --> 00:17:18.308
I just came from America,
so I didn't bring my passport!!!

217
00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:19.642
What's she saying?

218
00:17:19.642 --> 00:17:22.175
No minors allowed. Get out of here!

219
00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:24.683
Go!
Go!

220
00:17:31.524 --> 00:17:33.233
Get her!

221
00:17:33.233 --> 00:17:35.733
Where do you think you are going?

222
00:17:35.733 --> 00:17:37.908
You…

223
00:17:37.908 --> 00:17:38.775
Come on!

224
00:17:38.775 --> 00:17:40.251
Come on!

225
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.875
What?

226
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.275
Who are you, punk?

227
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.291
Hello?

228
00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:43.124
Ji-na?

229
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.600
What? Where? Korea?

230
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.124
What are you doing in Korea?

231
00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:51.542
Shouldn't you be in America?

232
00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:54.641
Huh? Police station?

233
00:18:54.641 --> 00:19:02.421
<i>Seoul Station</i>

234
00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:08.050
Hey, Man-bok!

235
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.958
I'm in Seoul right now!

236
00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.708
Where are you?

237
00:19:12.692 --> 00:19:15.011
Police station?

238
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.200
So when did you come back?

239
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.000
Today.

240
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.633
What about school?

241
00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:29.166
Does uncle know about this?

242
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.041
Can you stop nagging?

243
00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:32.850
I'm still jet-lagged.

244
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.992
Oh, is that right?

245
00:19:34.992 --> 00:19:37.875
Is that why you were at a club dancing?

246
00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:40.808
Not to mention getting the police involved.

247
00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:44.542
And who's that guy?

248
00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:47.700
Well, it's a long story.

249
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.308
He's the Prince Charming
who saved me back there.

250
00:19:51.308 --> 00:19:53.240
Sorry for the trouble, pal.

251
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.150
Thanks for helping my cousin.

252
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.066
Do I look like your pal?

253
00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.283
Thank you…

254
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.108
Hey, Man-bok!

255
00:20:11.108 --> 00:20:12.433
After all this time,

256
00:20:12.433 --> 00:20:15.242
our reunion is at a police station?

257
00:20:15.242 --> 00:20:17.724
You… you're that... wreck!

258
00:20:20.967 --> 00:20:27.621
You are… the loser!
What are you doing here?

259
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:33.458
I said get out.

260
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.558
Are you deaf?

261
00:20:37.517 --> 00:20:40.066
You get out!

262
00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:44.124
What? You got a place to clean in Seoul?

263
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.625
Oh, I guess the ex-champion is
a criminal now?

264
00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.233
Is that why you are here?

265
00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:52.750
Wait, you two know each other?

266
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.091
Are you kidding? That's
the loser!/the wreck!

267
00:20:57.124 --> 00:20:58.766
Hey Man-bok.
Are you going to introduce me or what?

268
00:20:58.766 --> 00:21:00.700
Oh, that's right!

269
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.725
This here is… my cousin.
Currently living in the U.S.

270
00:21:03.725 --> 00:21:06.792
No, wait. More like ran away from the U.S.

271
00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:08.083
Anyway, my cousin, Yu Ji-na.

272
00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:09.940
Hey, boys!

273
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.583
And this guy is my best friend,
Kang Ho-young.

274
00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:15.583
He's from Gangwon-do…

275
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:19.692
So… she's your cousin?

276
00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:21.867
Nice to meet you.

277
00:21:21.867 --> 00:21:23.792
What the heck.
You have a cousin this pretty,

278
00:21:23.792 --> 00:21:26.333
and you never told me until now?

279
00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:28.375
And this guy is…

280
00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:30.559
Park Eun-ho. Nice to meet you.

281
00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:31.792
Are you hurt?

282
00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:33.425
Nope.

283
00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.291
By the way, I'm not liking your tone
talking to your seniors.

284
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:38.300
Hey. That's America, man.

285
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.642
American style.

286
00:21:39.642 --> 00:21:40.375
See, I'm an expert at this.

287
00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:42.675
That's how they talk.

288
00:21:42.675 --> 00:21:44.600
That's right.

289
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.525
Where do you live?
I can give you a lift.

290
00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:47.542
She's got no place here.

291
00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:51.317
You go home.
We got it from here.

292
00:21:51.317 --> 00:21:53.975
Yeah. You must be busy.

293
00:21:53.975 --> 00:21:55.958
I'm not busy.

294
00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:01.658
Hey, everyone.

295
00:22:01.658 --> 00:22:03.742
I'd say it's a fate that we all met here.

296
00:22:03.742 --> 00:22:07.166
So let's grab something to eat.
I'm starving.

297
00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:13.933
Do you three really know each other?

298
00:22:13.933 --> 00:22:15.908
It's a fate all right.

299
00:22:15.908 --> 00:22:17.650
Tell me about it.

300
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.875
It's a bad luck.

301
00:22:18.917 --> 00:22:22.261
More like a rotten luck.

302
00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:36.259
What's this?

303
00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:38.558
It's delicious!

304
00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:44.000
If only that Q-tip head weren't here
to ruin the appetite,

305
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:47.692
it'd be even better.

306
00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:53.750
This is exactly my kind of food.

307
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.575
If only that rotten punk weren't here…

308
00:22:58.575 --> 00:23:01.291
I actually bought these
for Man-hee back home.

309
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.141
All right, that's it.
I'll take one for the team.

310
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.224
Hey! Nonsense…

311
00:23:14.224 --> 00:23:16.408
You are a minor. Give it here.

312
00:23:16.408 --> 00:23:19.216
This is okay in America!

313
00:23:19.216 --> 00:23:21.791
Well this is Korea!

314
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:23.124
So I'll take that shot.

315
00:23:23.124 --> 00:23:25.083
No way! Give it here.

316
00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:26.875
I think you should both call it a night.

317
00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:29.650
Nope! This is nothing!

318
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.567
It's getting dangerous for both of you.

319
00:23:47.542 --> 00:23:48.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

320
00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:50.208
Hey!

321
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.701
Wait, wait!

322
00:24:09.717 --> 00:24:11.792
Mom! You should come out!

323
00:24:11.833 --> 00:24:14.333
Hey! Man-hee!

324
00:24:19.883 --> 00:24:21.908
Hello, aunt.

325
00:24:21.908 --> 00:24:24.100
What… What is she doing in Korea?

326
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.525
Hey! Aunt!

327
00:24:25.525 --> 00:24:27.117
Baby shark, doo doo doo…

328
00:24:27.117 --> 00:24:28.583
Cute shark…

329
00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:31.621
Ho-young! What are you doing in Seoul?

330
00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:34.775
And who's this?

331
00:24:34.775 --> 00:24:38.911
Gosh! What's going on?

332
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.392
Explain yourself.

333
00:24:44.392 --> 00:24:47.108
Wait, no. Ji-na, you first.

334
00:24:47.108 --> 00:24:49.324
Why are you in Korea?

335
00:24:50.792 --> 00:24:52.692
I came back for the audition.

336
00:24:52.692 --> 00:24:56.859
Huh? Does your dad know?

337
00:24:58.792 --> 00:25:01.408
So you just sneaked back in?

338
00:25:01.408 --> 00:25:04.708
When you should be studying over there?

339
00:25:04.708 --> 00:25:08.933
If your dad finds out you are here,
he'll kill me.

340
00:25:08.933 --> 00:25:10.792
So just rest here for a bit,
and then go back.

341
00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:13.040
Aunt, this audition is

342
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.708
really important to me.

343
00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:16.708
Can you please turn a blind eye?
Just this once?

344
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.333
Not a chance.

345
00:25:17.333 --> 00:25:18.792
Aunt! Please!

346
00:25:18.792 --> 00:25:24.151
I'll go back right after the audition.
Okay?

347
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.000
They are so loud!
Shut that door!

348
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.525
Okay!

349
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.875
What are you smiling about?

350
00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:42.600
Oh, right.
I probably shouldn't be smiling.

351
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.031
Can you be any dumber?

352
00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:50.833
I just hope Ho-young
doesn't get sick from this.

353
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.150
Just my luck!

354
00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.940
Just my rotten luck!

355
00:26:14.375 --> 00:26:15.983
What the…!

356
00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:27.866
Man-bok!

357
00:26:27.866 --> 00:26:30.116
Man-bok!

358
00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:33.458
Hey, Man-bok. She's calling for you.

359
00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:35.600
Man-bok!

360
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.533
Man-bok!

361
00:26:38.533 --> 00:26:41.624
Hey, hurry up!

362
00:26:41.624 --> 00:26:44.250
She's calling for you.

363
00:26:46.916 --> 00:26:48.700
It's like I'm a dog or something.

364
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.800
What?

365
00:26:56.959 --> 00:26:59.675
For crying out loud…

366
00:26:59.675 --> 00:27:02.542
Hey! Cover that up!

367
00:27:02.542 --> 00:27:04.840
Why?

368
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.608
What?

369
00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.975
Ain't that hot?

370
00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:15.208
Did you not hear her?

371
00:27:18.416 --> 00:27:19.959
I just banged my head…

372
00:27:19.959 --> 00:27:23.559
As if there's anything to see back there.

373
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.166
What? Nothing to see?

374
00:27:25.208 --> 00:27:27.200
What's all this, then?

375
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.775
Look!

376
00:27:28.775 --> 00:27:31.692
These are some tight glutes.

377
00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:37.000
I think it's impressive…

378
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.608
Out of my way.

379
00:27:49.283 --> 00:27:52.975
Hey, get out of there.

380
00:27:52.975 --> 00:27:55.917
This is mine! Mine!

381
00:27:59.208 --> 00:28:00.933
Is this normal in your family?

382
00:28:00.933 --> 00:28:02.542
Does anyone knock before opening?

383
00:28:02.542 --> 00:28:05.859
Coach Son. You know why we recruited you.

384
00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:09.483
National team is just the beginning.
We want an Olympic gold medal.

385
00:28:09.483 --> 00:28:12.091
That's our goal.

386
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:14.175
Sure. I'll do my best.

387
00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:17.166
Since his defeat during that last race,

388
00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:21.550
Eun-ho hasn't been performing well.

389
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:26.150
I'd like you to skip the morning training.

390
00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:31.040
I thought I had full control
over his training?

391
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.350
Oh, of course! Full control…

392
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.566
Yes, of course.
I was just worried is all…

393
00:28:38.566 --> 00:28:42.950
Oh, and I heard you are testing
a new skater today.

394
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.391
Is there someone new?

395
00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:46.691
Sheesh… I have a test tomorrow.

396
00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:49.550
My condition is a mess.
I'm kind of worried.

397
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.708
What test?

398
00:28:50.708 --> 00:28:55.508
Kangbaek Foundation's
short track speed skating test.

399
00:28:55.508 --> 00:28:57.124
And if I pass…

400
00:28:57.124 --> 00:28:58.817
we'll be training in the same team!

401
00:28:58.817 --> 00:28:59.408
For real?

402
00:28:59.408 --> 00:29:01.271
- As a sport university student, too!
- Really?

403
00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:22.271
♫ <i>is kick it with you</i> ♫

404

♫ <i>Girl look at you baby

405

412
00:30:05.481 --> 00:30:09.142
Dang! She's good!

413
00:30:10.741 --> 00:30:11.559
Thanks.

414
00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:13.600
I was pretty thirsty.

415
00:30:21.258 --> 00:30:24.033
You are thirsty too, right?
Here.

416
00:30:24.033 --> 00:30:25.600
Thanks!

417
00:30:27.342 --> 00:30:29.692
So you won a single amateur race.

418
00:30:29.692 --> 00:30:32.466
And now you want to be a pro athlete?

419
00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:37.225
Well, you better be ready.

420
00:30:37.225 --> 00:30:39.159
For what?

421
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.458
Anything.

422
00:30:52.866 --> 00:30:54.659
This is awesome!

423
00:30:57.024 --> 00:31:02.091
Practicing here is
probably super effective!

424
00:31:02.091 --> 00:31:05.450
But then why are you so bad?

425
00:31:05.492 --> 00:31:08.192
I actually did improve a lot.

426
00:31:08.192 --> 00:31:11.824
That's good, friend.
Want to go for a race?

427
00:31:11.824 --> 00:31:14.092
I like the sound of that!

428
00:31:14.092 --> 00:31:16.367
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

429
00:31:41.058 --> 00:31:45.550
We have a test scheduled today
for a new skater Coach Son brought.

430
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.450
What about Eun-ho?

431
00:31:46.492 --> 00:31:47.866
He'll have a meeting with the coach today,

432
00:31:47.908 --> 00:31:50.640
and then go straight to training.

433
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.883
That new guy Son is bringing…

434
00:31:52.883 --> 00:31:56.042
sounds like a really skilled skater.

435
00:31:56.042 --> 00:32:00.283
Maybe he was trained overseas.
Son was really confident.

436
00:32:00.283 --> 00:32:04.466
Perhaps if Eun-ho were to train with him…

437
00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:08.517
It'd be a good stimulant for him.

438
00:32:10.041 --> 00:32:12.741
Is the new person that good?

439
00:32:12.741 --> 00:32:14.575
What's his name?

440
00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.458
You practice here too?

441
00:32:23.458 --> 00:32:26.575
I've been practicing here
since elementary school.

442
00:32:26.575 --> 00:32:29.600
So why haven't I seen you here before?

443
00:32:30.475 --> 00:32:34.175
That's because I practice alone,
when you guys aren't here.

444
00:32:34.175 --> 00:32:37.308
I guess a champion really is different.

445
00:32:39.175 --> 00:32:40.775
Hold up…

446
00:32:42.016 --> 00:32:44.341
This is Kangbaek Foundation…

447
00:32:45.641 --> 00:32:48.575
The chairman's son's name is
Park Eun-ho…

448
00:32:49.924 --> 00:32:52.750
And I made him sleep in that tiny room!

449
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.158
You didn't make him sleep there.

450
00:32:54.158 --> 00:32:57.350
He got wasted and slept there on his own.

451
00:32:58.242 --> 00:33:00.041
So is this what you meant by
"better be ready"?

452
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:03.640
Can you even practice after
getting wasted like that?

453
00:33:05.866 --> 00:33:08.242
It's just a practice for me.

454
00:33:08.242 --> 00:33:10.433
But don't you have a test?

455
00:33:12.417 --> 00:33:15.524
Good luck with that test.

456
00:33:20.483 --> 00:33:23.333
Every single word he says is trashy.
How does he even do that?

457
00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:24.740
I didn't do anything wrong, did I?

458
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.366
Why? Is he that great?

459
00:33:27.366 --> 00:33:29.350
Kangbaek is the most prestigious name
in the sports industry.

460
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.840
The chairman is Park Hun.
Park Eun-ho is his son!

461
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.492
Ranked first place, both domestically
and internationally.

462
00:33:34.492 --> 00:33:35.640
He's the short track emperor!

463
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.150
Sure… emperor…

464
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.733
That guy just walks a different path, man!

465
00:33:40.733 --> 00:33:44.591
And I made him sleep like a nobody.

466
00:33:44.591 --> 00:33:46.158
I hope he doesn't take revenge on me later.

467
00:33:46.158 --> 00:33:47.625
Why would he?

468
00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.766
You saved his drunken butt
from freezing to death!

469
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.592
Auntie asked you to
help out at the restaurant.

470
00:33:56.592 --> 00:33:57.908
Why aren't you helping?

471
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.075
I'm busy.

472
00:33:59.116 --> 00:34:02.383
Ho-young's Kangbaek Foundation
entrance test is today.

473
00:34:02.383 --> 00:34:05.783
I have to go cheer for him.

474
00:34:05.783 --> 00:34:08.266
By the way, was that guy your boyfriend?

475
00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:10.117
Nothing like that.

476
00:34:10.117 --> 00:34:12.142
It's a long story.

477
00:34:12.142 --> 00:34:15.617
So that Ho-young. What is he like?

478
00:34:15.617 --> 00:34:18.050
What is he like? Can't you tell?

479
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.116
He's hot. He's gentle.

480
00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:22.250
He's an athlete. He's funny.

481
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.125
What doesn't he have?

482
00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:25.933
Back in Gangwon-do, he was so popular,

483
00:34:25.933 --> 00:34:28.175
he had an army of girls
chasing after him.

484
00:34:28.175 --> 00:34:30.216
Can you imagine how hard it was for me?

485
00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:31.750
Hard for you? Why?

486
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.067
Nothing you need to know!

487
00:34:35.924 --> 00:34:38.625
Should I go too? To cheer?

488
00:34:38.625 --> 00:34:40.175
What about that audition?

489
00:34:40.175 --> 00:34:42.383
I can just stop by on my way there.

490
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.966
The chairman wants to
have a lunch with you.

491
00:34:59.966 --> 00:35:02.366
So be sure to make time for that.

492
00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:04.359
Hello.

493
00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:08.566
Wait, this is him?

494
00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:14.016
I've never seen him before.

495
00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:16.175
Is he really from overseas?

496
00:35:16.175 --> 00:35:19.316
Just watch. You'll understand.

497
00:35:19.316 --> 00:35:21.525
Kang Ho-young. Are you ready?

498
00:35:21.525 --> 00:35:22.475
Yes.

499
00:35:22.475 --> 00:35:24.740
Don't think about the record.
Just go at it.

500
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.641
How about five laps?
Can you do that?

501
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:30.700
Sure.

502
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.492
Wait!

503
00:35:31.492 --> 00:35:34.816
Short track skating is a competitive sport.

504
00:35:34.816 --> 00:35:38.100
Shouldn't he have an opponent?

505
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:43.040
Lucky we have Park Eun-ho here,
the best skater in the world.

506
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:49.500
How about a race between them?

507
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.700
We'd be able to tell his potential

508
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.992
by comparing him to Eun-ho.

509
00:35:56.992 --> 00:36:02.358
Sure, he's a bit out of practice.

510
00:36:02.358 --> 00:36:06.841
But he still got his basics.
There's no way he'll lose.

511
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:07.991
Isn't that right, Eun-ho?

512
00:36:07.991 --> 00:36:11.151
What? Who's beating who?

513
00:36:31.158 --> 00:36:33.140
Looks like they're about to start.

514
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.775
Huh? That guy next to him…

515
00:36:35.775 --> 00:36:38.283
Isn't that the guy from last night?

516
00:36:39.875 --> 00:36:42.575
Go! Kang Ho-young!

517
00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:43.991
Watch closely.

518
00:36:44.033 --> 00:36:46.492
I'll show you what short track really is.

519
00:36:46.492 --> 00:36:50.133
Oh, please do, Mr. Loser.

520
00:36:50.133 --> 00:36:51.666
Enough with that loser thing!

521
00:36:51.666 --> 00:36:53.966
Then show me the emperor.

522
00:36:53.966 --> 00:36:56.650
I won't hold back.
Try not to get scared.

523
00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.216
My thoughts exactly.
Try not to be too surprised.

524
00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:03.131
I'm a rising star.
You are a falling one.

525
00:37:22.492 --> 00:37:25.292
Wooo! Good luck!

526
00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:01.850
What… What's with that guy?

527
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.591
Who is he?

528
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.866
What is he? What a monster…

529
00:38:06.866 --> 00:38:08.708
Even I didn't expect this…

530
00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:13.283
But looks like Eun-ho's still got it!

531
00:38:13.283 --> 00:38:17.924
He says slump and what not,
but that was all nothing!

532
00:38:17.924 --> 00:38:20.601
Really impressive!

533
00:38:42.617 --> 00:38:45.617
Yes! Ho-young won!

534
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:46.933
He's so good!

535
00:38:46.933 --> 00:38:50.191
Right?
That's our Ho-young for you.

536
00:38:50.191 --> 00:38:53.350
What. Ji-na, who were you cheering for?

537
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.633
Huh?

538
00:38:54.633 --> 00:38:57.583
You should be cheering for Eun-ho!

539
00:38:57.583 --> 00:38:59.866
Says who?

540
00:38:59.866 --> 00:39:02.200
Anyway, they are both amazing!

541
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.500
So cool…

542
00:39:07.908 --> 00:39:10.008
So who won?

543
00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:13.200
Does it matter?

544
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.740
It's a competition.
It's the only thing that matters.

545
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.591
Sheesh…

546
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:21.000
I'm really curious now…

547
00:39:51.433 --> 00:39:56.300
What a shame.
I could have beaten you more definitively.

548
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.166
Such a shame…

549
00:39:58.166 --> 00:39:59.258
What are you talking about?

550
00:39:59.258 --> 00:40:00.824
Being so arrogant after you jumped?

551
00:40:00.824 --> 00:40:03.366
I'm saying it because I jumped.

552
00:40:04.225 --> 00:40:05.575
Are you blind?

553
00:40:05.575 --> 00:40:08.375
It's clear that I came in first.

554
00:40:10.142 --> 00:40:13.866
I guess the so-called "emperor"

555
00:40:13.866 --> 00:40:17.142
can't stand the shame of losing to me.
Is that right?

556
00:40:17.142 --> 00:40:19.942
But what can I say?
It happened.

557
00:40:19.942 --> 00:40:21.075
I said that's not what happened!

558
00:40:21.075 --> 00:40:22.450
"I said that's not what happened!"

559
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.271
Sure. Whatever helps you sleep.

560
00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:30.450
Excellent performance today. Both of you.

561
00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.616
That was an amazing race.

562
00:40:32.616 --> 00:40:34.417
Thank you.

563
00:40:34.417 --> 00:40:36.316
First things first.
Ho-young, you passed the test.

564
00:40:36.316 --> 00:40:39.800
You are now a part of
Kangbaek Foundation's short track team.

565
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.175
Keep the friendly competition going
like you guys did today,

566
00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:43.408
and keep training like that.

567
00:40:43.408 --> 00:40:45.200
Good work.

568
00:40:46.033 --> 00:40:47.275
And Ho-young…

569
00:40:47.275 --> 00:40:49.350
Let's make Ho-young…

570
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.367
Eun-ho's pacesetter.

571
00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:53.316
For now, that is.

572
00:40:53.316 --> 00:40:53.908
What?

573
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.242
We are covering his tuition,

574
00:40:55.242 --> 00:40:57.240
and even his housing!

575
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.116
Shouldn't he at least return the favor

576
00:40:59.158 --> 00:41:02.525
to Kangbaek Foundation in some way?

577
00:41:02.525 --> 00:41:05.108
You'll be Eun-ho's pacesetter.

578
00:41:06.408 --> 00:41:08.367
Huh?

579
00:41:08.367 --> 00:41:10.467
A pacesetter?

580
00:41:13.158 --> 00:41:14.558
Why me?

581
00:41:14.558 --> 00:41:18.016
Eun-ho is a skilled pro.
We want you to learn from him, too.

582
00:41:18.016 --> 00:41:20.150
From this guy?

583
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.550
No thanks.

584
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.575
I'm against this, too.

585
00:41:23.575 --> 00:41:25.831
I'm against this even more!

586
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.541
You two. Get out.

587
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:31.116
Out! Give me 10 laps on the track!

588
00:41:31.116 --> 00:41:31.866
Huh?

589
00:41:31.866 --> 00:41:35.958
No? How about 20 laps?

590
00:41:38.783 --> 00:41:42.716
I hear that the new kid
raced against Eun-ho.

591
00:41:42.716 --> 00:41:47.108
People say Eun-ho's in a slump, but…whew!

592
00:41:47.108 --> 00:41:50.183
He's still in his prime for sure!

593
00:41:50.183 --> 00:41:53.200
So in his prime, he still lost to that kid?

594
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.133
Well he didn't lose, technically.

595
00:41:56.133 --> 00:42:02.208
It was unbelievable.
Down to a thousandth of a second…

596
00:42:02.208 --> 00:42:03.275
They came in at the exact same time.

597
00:42:03.275 --> 00:42:05.450
That's same as losing!

598
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.133
Eun-ho's been skating since kindergarten.

599
00:42:07.133 --> 00:42:08.600
Then some kid shows up out of nowhere,

600
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.940
and races him to a draw!
With no training!

601
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.383
Who do you think did better?

602
00:42:13.383 --> 00:42:16.808
This will be a good stimulation for Eun-ho.

603
00:42:16.808 --> 00:42:19.708
With someone like Kang as his pacemaker,

604
00:42:19.708 --> 00:42:21.100
he'll want to beat him no matter what.

605
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.008
He'll surely improve a lot.

606
00:43:13.908 --> 00:43:15.942
And Ho-young…

607
00:43:15.942 --> 00:43:18.424
You'll be Eun-ho's pacesetter.

608
00:43:46.392 --> 00:43:50.833
I'm quitting short track skating.

609
00:43:58.492 --> 00:44:01.608
Hello? This is Korea News,
Sports Department.

610
00:44:01.608 --> 00:44:04.383
I'm Park Eun-ho, the short track skater.

611
00:44:05.783 --> 00:44:08.433
I want a press conference.
I'm retiring.

612
00:44:14.433 --> 00:44:16.575
Is this the reason why you brought me here?

613
00:44:16.575 --> 00:44:19.808
To make me Eun-ho's pacesetter?

614
00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:23.191
No can one decide your worth

615
00:44:23.191 --> 00:44:25.775
but yourself.

616
00:44:27.659 --> 00:44:29.600
You can either be his pacesetter,

617
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.221
or you can make him your pacesetter.

618
00:44:37.158 --> 00:44:39.300
So you mean…

619
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.566
Each of you have your own
strengths and weaknesses.

620
00:44:42.566 --> 00:44:45.367
You have excellent musculature, but

621
00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:48.040
you're lacking in basic skills
and competition tactics.

622
00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.341
On the other hand, Eun-ho has
strong foundational assets.

623
00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:54.575
The school has exempted you from your tuition.

624
00:44:54.575 --> 00:44:56.158
Not to mention the free housing.

625
00:44:56.158 --> 00:44:58.540
You may think of this as
returning their favor.

626
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.300
But the reason I told you to be
Eun-ho's pacesetter is

627
00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.333
because you two have
a lot to learn from each other.

628
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.175
Park Eun-ho has announced his retirement.

629
00:45:13.175 --> 00:45:14.991
A video was uploaded just now.

630
00:45:14.991 --> 00:45:16.575
Is it from Park's practice today?

631
00:45:16.575 --> 00:45:18.659
Yes.
Despite the rumors of his recent slump,

632
00:45:18.659 --> 00:45:20.640
he still hasn't lost his touch at all.

633
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.950
But we've never seen
the other skater before.

634
00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:23.866
He's a new face, right?

635
00:45:23.866 --> 00:45:26.058
That's right.
The public is dying to know

636
00:45:26.058 --> 00:45:28.016
who this man is!

637
00:45:28.016 --> 00:45:29.208
Darn it, Oh!

638
00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:32.033
What kind of job are you doing out there?

639
00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:34.675
Didn't I tell you to
keep a close eye on Eun-ho?

640
00:45:34.675 --> 00:45:38.475
Stop him!
Stop that press conference no matter what!

641
00:45:38.475 --> 00:45:40.059
Now!

642
00:45:40.059 --> 00:45:41.783
Yes…

643
00:46:06.325 --> 00:46:07.325
What were you thinking?

644
00:46:07.367 --> 00:46:09.200
All this because of one practice run?

645
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.833
Huh?

646
00:46:12.033 --> 00:46:14.116
I'm…

647
00:46:14.116 --> 00:46:15.740
quitting sports.

648
00:46:15.741 --> 00:46:19.151
Get your dad's permission first.

649
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.158
What? I can't even quit on my own?

650
00:46:24.158 --> 00:46:25.758
No!

651
00:46:33.733 --> 00:46:37.671
Epilogue
