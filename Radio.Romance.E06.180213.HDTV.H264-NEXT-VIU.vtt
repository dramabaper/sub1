1
00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:53.970
I'm curious...

2
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.079
about you.

3
00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:08.759
Why are you bothering me?

4
00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:11.389
Just show me your cue sheet.

5
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.690
I'll return it when I'm done.

6
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.529
- You wanted the proposal. - It doesn't matter.

7
00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.830
Just hand over everything.

8
00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.770
Why didn't we just say hello?

9
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.139
You're looking good since you moved under Lee Gang.

10
00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.080
- Are you happy? - Of course not.

11
00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.180
I want to kill him.

12
00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:33.979
We worked all night yesterday too.

13
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.380
Hey,

14
00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.089
why didn't you recruit me to your team?

15
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.759
It was so nice not doing any work.

16
00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.130
What? You're disgusting.

17
00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.130
Just hurry up and bring me the cue sheet.

18
00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.330
Hold on. It's in the booth.

19
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.040
Is this where I jump to the bridge?

20
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.839
Yes. I already highlighted it.

21
00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.279
Hey. What are you two doing?

22
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.480
We're preparing for the show.

23
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.990
At this hour?

24
00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.490
I've been helping him with this and that.

25
00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.930
The writer and the DJ are like one person.

26
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.990
One person?

27
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.599
Can you write down how I should react here?

28
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.029
Okay.

29
00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.210
What? They spent the night together?

30
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.909
Ji Soo Ho is working really hard.

31
00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.210
They were looking at the script in the booth.

32
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.619
- Did they sleep together? - Hey!

33
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.849
What nonsense are you saying?

34
00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.319
Song Geu Rim, you impertinent thing.

35
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.589
Don't you know the rumor?

36
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.360
Something always happens...

37
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.559
if you spend a night in the booth together.

38
00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.800
Don't jinx them.

39
00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.439
Wait. Song Geu Rim and La La Hee...

40
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.909
Who had more listeners?

41
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.240
Our lives would be easier if Ms. La won.

42
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.839
I know.

43
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.610
I vote for Geu Rim.

44
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.119
Of course, we won. We have Mr. Namaste.

45
00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.089
- Namaste. - Namaste.

46
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.950
Everyone,

47
00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.659
KBC performed a special research...

48
00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:27.490
to get listener ratings on the two shows.

49
00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.830
Is this steep straight line...

50
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:36.270
really for a radio show at our station?

51
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.409
Now.

52
00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.379
Is it Ji Soo Ho's "Radio Romance"?

53
00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.610
Or, is it Jay's "Let's Meet at 6PM"?

54
00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:44.909
What will it be?

55
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.249
Ji Soo Ho!

56
00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.189
Okay.

57
00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.760
We agreed that the loser will work on Sundays too.

58
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.900
It's best to work...

59
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.129
on holidays.

60
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.700
Too bad. Our team will have to go on a trip.

61
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.300
- Sure. - Right.

62
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.469
We'll use Sung Woo's booth starting next show.

63
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.439
- You? - Really?

64
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.479
Did you get his permission?

65
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.779
Namaste.

66
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.950
Hey! Everything is great,

67
00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.120
but let's get just one show recorded.

68
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.919
No way.

69
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.630
Hey!

70
00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.029
Gosh. I just can't hate him.

71
00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:41.299
By the way, where is Geu Rim?

72
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.799
I'm not sure.

73
00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:49.380
Let's just keep this up.

74
00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.060
Soo Ho, what did you mean by that?

75
00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:07.489
What do you mean you're curious?

76
00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.830
That's you what you said to me earlier.

77
00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.940
What are you curious about?

78
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.669
Well...

79
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.010
Gosh.

80
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.549
Are you serious?

81
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.750
Why are you always eating my food?

82
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.190
Don't be so cheap.

83
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.520
Here. You can have this.

84
00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.260
Thank you.

85
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.659
Soo Ho, thanks to you,

86
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.099
we had the highest listener rating.

87
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.270
It's nothing.

88
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.109
That's why we must go somewhere today.

89
00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.510
Let's go!

90
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.020
You really won't come with us?

91
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.950
No. I have a shoot tomorrow.

92
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.320
- I have to prepare... - We need you there.

93
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.390
- Why? - We're getting a sponsor.

94
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.089
We need your face.

95
00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.159
I said no.

96
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.000
Why not?

97
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.299
What kind of a show would you do in there?

98
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.409
You sly thing you.

99
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.940
Did you think I'd let you if you bring Ji Soo Ho?

100
00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:33.580
How nice would it be if he did the show...

101
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.320
in your booth?

102
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.820
Our ratings were awesome.

103
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.849
Also,

104
00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.549
if Ji Soo Ho does a show in your booth,

105
00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:42.719
he can get tips from you.

106
00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.489
Also, if Ji Soo Ho does a show in your booth,

107
00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:46.460
he'd play the records, so my job gets easier...

108
00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.099
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.070
Come on.

110
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.070
It's been a dream to do a show in your booth.

111
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.739
If you'd lend us your booth,

112
00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:02.310
it means I totally succeeded, right?

113
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.839
Please,

114
00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.710
give it to us to celebrate...

115
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.450
Ji Soo Ho entering the world of radio.

116
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.320
The living legend's booth.

117
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.719
Soo Ho, why don't you say something too?

118
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.190
Why do you want to do it in my booth?

119
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.500
I don't want to.

120
00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.210
I don't care even if it isn't your booth.

121
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.039
All booths are the same.

122
00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:42.150
I'll lend it to you.

123
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:43.849
What?

124
00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:44.989
What?

125
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.190
I'll lend it to you.

126
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.289
But go hiking with me every day.

127
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.890
What do you mean?

128
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:54.830
You say all booths are the same,

129
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.029
so I'll teach you that they are not.

130
00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:04.510
Use my booth starting your next show.

131
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.539
You promised!

132
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.539
Yes.

133
00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:20.750
Come on!

134
00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:25.929
I'm overwhelmed with a sense of betrayal.

135
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.060
What, punk?

136
00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:30.000
Going hiking together...

137
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.200
is stage three of your friendship.

138
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.569
Why did you invite him to go hiking already?

139
00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.000
He's cute.

140
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.640
He's a newbie who doesn't even know...

141
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.010
how important the space is in radio.

142
00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.539
I should teach him.

143
00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:47.250
Come on!

144
00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:50.480
Why don't you teach me like that?

145
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.470
The Ji Soo Ho effect is incredible.

146
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.640
We never fail if you're there.

147
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.140
Forget it.

148
00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:22.750
Now that we got the venue sponsored,

149
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.480
let's go for the next sponsorship.

150
00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:32.090
I'll go now.

151
00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:35.230
Then let's do this.

152
00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:46.370
Whoever gets it in decides, okay?

153
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.079
Forget it.

154
00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:50.539
Forget what? This is a world of competitions.

155
00:09:50.939 --> 00:09:52.850
Are you not athletic?

156
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.529
Yes.

157
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.569
Here. Here. Throw this out properly.

158
00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:59.250
Where are we going?

159
00:11:00.909 --> 00:11:04.850
We should give a gift to the listeners too.

160
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.720
What gift? It's freezing.

161
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.539
Excuse us.

162
00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:26.610
- Hello. - Hello.

163
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:27.709
Hello.

164
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.980
Are you the owner of All Natural Labs?

165
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.750
You wrote to our radio show.

166
00:11:33.049 --> 00:11:34.079
Yes.

167
00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.579
I'm Lee Gang, the production director.

168
00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:40.949
You conducted research on skincare for all ages,

169
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.390
but people of all ages shunned you...

170
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.159
The person...

171
00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:52.000
who can't even afford ramyeon because of debt...

172
00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:11.120
I hate when people say suffering is good for you.

173
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.250
I work all night, but the debt piles up.

174
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.490
Forget buying a house.

175
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.260
I can't even pay this month's rent.

176
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.299
(Let's break up.)

177
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.140
Reality is, if you dream, you become a fool.

178
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.779
But there are many fools like me...

179
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.880
who write to radio stations.

180
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.850
But...

181
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.120
I can't live as a fool any longer.

182
00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:50.220
I ran out of funds for the research.

183
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.630
We'll buy your cosmetics...

184
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.630
from our show.

185
00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:58.730
You have the operation budget, right?

186
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.510
Sponsors come knocking because of Soo Ho.

187
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.970
Why would we pay...

188
00:13:07.909 --> 00:13:10.809
Ji Soo Ho and we support for All Natural Labs.

189
00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:11.949
We support you.

190
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:14.750
We'll market you to our listeners too.

191
00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:16.049
Who will? Ji Soo Ho will.

192
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:22.860
Also, I heard yesterday...

193
00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:25.789
that failures can become successes.

194
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.029
Don't give up. We're cheering for you.

195
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.669
- We're cheering for you. - My patient...

196
00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:34.100
still refuses therapy...

197
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.640
and suffers from chronic insomnia.

198
00:13:36.939 --> 00:13:37.939
As a result of...

199
00:13:38.209 --> 00:13:40.470
leading only fake relationships...

200
00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:41.840
demanded by the visible world...

201
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.309
rather than real relationships,

202
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.510
he fears showing his true self...

203
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.549
and refuses to do so.

204
00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:51.220
There has been a notable change recently.

205
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.549
Rather than due to circumstances,

206
00:13:53.919 --> 00:13:57.159
he has made different choices due to a person.

207
00:13:57.829 --> 00:14:00.329
I will monitor those decisions...

208
00:14:00.689 --> 00:14:02.000
and changes.

209
00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:05.929
I guess you can't control Soo Ho anymore.

210
00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:08.340
I believe he is with the radio team.

211
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.569
Exactly.

212
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.870
Soo Ho doesn't hang out with people,

213
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.270
but he's doing just that.

214
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:15.179
Isn't it strange?

215
00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:16.179
Still,

216
00:14:16.579 --> 00:14:18.610
he seems to have opened his heart...

217
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.250
Exactly.

218
00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:23.350
That's strange.

219
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.390
You understand, don't you?

220
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.390
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:29.659
You may go.

222
00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:35.059
Hello. I sent Jin Tae Ri.

223
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.959
Did you see her?

224
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.270
Yes.

225
00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.340
I'm always well.

226
00:14:45.439 --> 00:14:47.370
Jin Tae Ri,

227
00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:50.740
I never see you on TV anymore.

228
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:56.049
Oh, my. It's not like I'm "never" on TV.

229
00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:59.520
You're not good enough to be the model...

230
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.919
for our refrigerator commercial.

231
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.559
Oh, my. If you say I'm not good enough...

232
00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:07.090
to my face like that,

233
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.760
should I reply by saying,

234
00:15:08.929 --> 00:15:10.529
"Yes, I am good enough"?

235
00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:15.370
You should know better.

236
00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:17.840
Am I good enough to shoot the commercial...

237
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.309
for your fridge?

238
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:22.740
The rumors were true.

239
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.750
Mr. Baldy, you say,

240
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.919
"The rumors were true."

241
00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:31.390
What rumors do you mean?

242
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.760
You have no fear, do you?

243
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.959
You're so unpopular...

244
00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.760
that you were sent here!

245
00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:44.929
I'm better than you jerks who called me here.

246
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.970
- What? - Think about it.

247
00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:49.000
Losers who can't even win over...

248
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.069
an unpopular actress like me.

249
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.840
Why you little...

250
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:55.309
Hey!

251
00:15:55.809 --> 00:15:56.880
Hey. Let go!

252
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.079
Who do you think you are?

253
00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:00.750
How dare a has-been act like a top star?

254
00:16:04.049 --> 00:16:05.289
Hey, Mr. Kim.

255
00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:07.150
What brings you here?

256
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.260
This kid is with you, right?

257
00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:13.990
I'm not your kid!

258
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.230
Be quiet.

259
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:20.900
Come out.

260
00:16:55.439 --> 00:16:56.500
My apologies.

261
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:58.669
If our kid made a mistake, please forgive her.

262
00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:02.240
If she was rude, please be understanding.

263
00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.409
How dare that cheap little...

264
00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:09.679
Keep a close eye on her!

265
00:17:09.749 --> 00:17:12.150
People like that will stab you in the back.

266
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.120
Yes, sir. Let me pour you a drink.

267
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.400
But, sir.

268
00:17:28.939 --> 00:17:32.040
Will you have our kid do the commercial?

269
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.880
Are you insane?

270
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.880
Who would hire someone like her?

271
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:39.110
Exactly.

272
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.519
If you weren't even going to hire her,

273
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.749
why did you hit...

274
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.290
and grab a girl by her hair?

275
00:17:57.259 --> 00:17:58.370
Yes, sir.

276
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.469
I'll pay the check.

277
00:18:06.969 --> 00:18:07.979
Good night.

278
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.449
Mister.

279
00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:23.390
So give it to me quickly.

280
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.300
I'll use Soo Ho in every way possible.

281
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.530
I know his past,

282
00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:36.100
and you have the evidence.

283
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.050
Where are you going now?

284
00:18:46.749 --> 00:18:49.380
We have to work all night at the studio.

285
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.259
And here's the revised script.

286
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.459
This seems to be...

287
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.900
the only method I have right now.

288
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.259
(Ji Soo Ho's Radio Romance)

289
00:19:10.269 --> 00:19:11.640
Newbie, let's go.

290
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.949
Good night, Soo Ho.

291
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.850
But...

292
00:19:22.249 --> 00:19:25.620
why do you call Geu Rim "Newbie" again?

293
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.060
Isn't she the main writer?

294
00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:32.560
There's another newbie, so it gets confusing.

295
00:19:33.189 --> 00:19:35.330
Why is it confusing?

296
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.100
I call only Geu Rim "Newbie".

297
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.199
Plus, that newbie writer quit, I think.

298
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.769
I can't reach her.

299
00:19:43.169 --> 00:19:45.340
Still, please don't call her "Newbie".

300
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.880
- She's the main... - But you treat her...

301
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.780
like she's a newbie.

302
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.209
Although of course, differently than I do.

303
00:19:53.449 --> 00:19:54.679
What do you mean?

304
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.519
You ignore her scripts and make her run errands.

305
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.719
You treat our main writer like a newbie.

306
00:20:04.929 --> 00:20:08.060
Okay, then. We'll go now. See you tomorrow.

307
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.630
She and I will stay together tonight.

308
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.870
Geu Rim!

309
00:20:16.469 --> 00:20:17.769
Can we talk?

310
00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:27.310
I have a photo shoot out of town tomorrow.

311
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.679
Yes, I know. I heard it ends at 2pm.

312
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.489
What if I'm late for the live show?

313
00:20:34.689 --> 00:20:35.689
Pardon?

314
00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:37.560
I can't be late,

315
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.929
so I want to use term four of the Geu Rim contract.

316
00:20:39.929 --> 00:20:46.269
(Song Geu Rim can't refuse Ji Soo Ho's request.)

317
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.310
I need you to drive me tomorrow.

318
00:20:57.209 --> 00:20:59.380
Am I your driver or something?

319
00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:01.820
So, you can't stay with Mr. Lee tonight.

320
00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.550
You'll have to go home and sleep...

321
00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.449
so that you can drive safely tomorrow.

322
00:21:05.449 --> 00:21:07.620
I'll take care of it.

323
00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:12.890
What if our ratings go down again...

324
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.830
after we give away so many gifts?

325
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.259
Isn't it odd?

326
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.469
Why is JH sponsoring us, instead of their son?

327
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.070
Don't worry about useless things,

328
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.769
and get our ratings up.

329
00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:29.080
Got that?

330
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.590
Good work with today's show.

331
00:21:39.749 --> 00:21:40.989
Are you mocking me?

332
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.120
I wasn't...

333
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.229
What exactly is your role on that team?

334
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.860
Pardon?

335
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.429
Ji Soo Ho's team writes the script, right?

336
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.429
So what exactly do you do as a writer?

337
00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:57.939
Do you think you got top ratings because of you?

338
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.979
It's infuriating how they make...

339
00:22:01.979 --> 00:22:04.380
just anyone a main writer.

340
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.999
Ji Soo Ho's team writes the script, right?

341
00:22:27.499 --> 00:22:31.169
So what exactly do you do as a writer?

342
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.249

(Mom)

346
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.850
Hello, Mother.

347
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.219
Hello? Soo Ho?

348
00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:19.350
It's Geu Rim.

349
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:21.890
I know.

350
00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:25.360
- The script... - The script...

351
00:23:27.159 --> 00:23:29.060
How was it?

352
00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:32.469
Well... I didn't get to study it enough...

353
00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:35.439
to use it for the show tomorrow, so...

354
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.239
It's okay. At least you read it.

355
00:23:40.439 --> 00:23:41.540
Okay.

356
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.310
- Okay, then. - What?

357
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.449
Are you hanging up already?

358
00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:50.380
Then... What else should I do?

359
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.489
Soo Ho.

360
00:23:55.189 --> 00:23:57.759
I really want to write a good script.

361
00:23:58.489 --> 00:23:59.890
If I write it well,

362
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.459
you will use my script for your show one day.

363
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:03.560
Right?

364
00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:05.830
Right.

365
00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:08.199
So, the DJ must speak with...

366
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.570
the writer the most.

367
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.409
I'm the one who writes...

368
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.310
what you want to say into the mic.

369
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.380
Although I don't yet.

370
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.949
Don't you find that offensive?

371
00:24:22.749 --> 00:24:23.820
Pardon?

372
00:24:24.689 --> 00:24:27.550
The fact that I don't use your script for the show.

373
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.290
It is a bit infuriating, but I have no choice.

374
00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:38.999
That means I must write an incredibly good script.

375
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.169
It upsets me,

376
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.370
but I'm not good enough to write it.

377
00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:48.840
But come to think of it,

378
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.880
I'm not angry at you, but at myself,

379
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.979
for being unable to write.

380
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.860
I have a question.

381
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.459
This is a personal question.

382
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.830
Why don't you carry a cell phone?

383
00:25:12.229 --> 00:25:14.400
Why would I carry a cell phone?

384
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.969
I have no one to call.

385
00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:17.870
Pardon?

386
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.070
I have no one to call.

387
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.810
There's no one who would call me.

388
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.979
Your selfishness knows no bounds.

389
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.090
Why don't you have anyone to call?

390
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.090
Me. Mr. Lee. Your manager. You should call us.

391
00:25:37.189 --> 00:25:39.489
And why is there no one who would call you?

392
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.330
When I get stuck while writing...

393
00:25:43.499 --> 00:25:47.499
and wonder what you like or what words you use,

394
00:25:47.699 --> 00:25:50.499
you can answer my calls.

395
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.209
Soo Ho.

396
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.509
Can't you get a cell phone?

397
00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:01.050
And if I do?

398
00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:04.519
If I do,

399
00:26:06.489 --> 00:26:07.919
are you going to call every day?

400
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.290
Pardon?

401
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:13.689
Are you home?

402
00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:17.429
Yes. I'm home.

403
00:26:17.429 --> 00:26:18.530
You should sleep early.

404
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.300
You have to drive tomorrow.

405
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.669
What?

406
00:26:26.739 --> 00:26:28.810
Gosh.

407
00:26:31.179 --> 00:26:32.580
That's great.

408
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.009
Soo Ho, this way.

409
00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:35.380
It looks great.

410
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.090
You can pose naturally.

411
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.390
That's perfect!

412
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.959
Yes, that's the look.

413
00:26:49.699 --> 00:26:51.630
Yes, you look beautiful.

414
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.870
Beautiful, beautiful.

415
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.439
Gosh! It's so good.

416
00:26:58.269 --> 00:27:00.909
Okay. We'll continue after a lunch break.

417
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.090
Yes. I'm actually nearby.

418
00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.130
Is it all right if I pay a visit?

419
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.900
Okay, sure. Okay.

420
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.439
Soo Ho,

421
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.810
how many more hours do you have to shoot?

422
00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.610
I have to go somewhere.

423
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.650
I'll take the car and make it fast.

424
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.679
Are you telling me to get off?

425
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:01.999
Ready, go.

426
00:28:01.999 --> 00:28:07.469
- Goodbye, my friend - Goodbye, my friend

427
00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:14.719
- When the foghorn sounds - When the foghorn sounds

428
00:28:16.219 --> 00:28:19.519
- Will you cry for me - Will you cry for me

429
00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:23.090
- Without anyone knowing? - Without anyone knowing?

430
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.390
Is Sang Goo the only one graduating?

431
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.360
What will happen to them?

432
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.630
We'll merge with another nearby school.

433
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.969
We had two kids in graduating class,

434
00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:35.140
but Sang Goo is the only one to graduate.

435
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.209
Where is he right now?

436
00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:50.479
Are you a reporter?

437
00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:52.550
Get lost.

438
00:28:53.519 --> 00:28:54.689
What?

439
00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:56.989
Are you here to write a story?

440
00:28:57.189 --> 00:28:59.259
We had some come by yesterday.

441
00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:00.360
Sang Goo.

442
00:29:00.929 --> 00:29:02.229
Are you throwing a tantrum...

443
00:29:02.229 --> 00:29:03.499
because you don't want to graduate?

444
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:04.830
Why are you doing that?

445
00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:07.199
It's none of your business.

446
00:29:07.939 --> 00:29:10.640
Go away. Go!

447
00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:12.769
Why do you...

448
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:14.840
keep showing up in front of me?

449
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.979
Why must I tell you that?

450
00:29:16.979 --> 00:29:19.280
If you don't want to do it, just leave.

451
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.110
Leave. Please.

452
00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:24.519
Hey.

453
00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:27.249
You remind me of someone.

454
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:31.989
This is Gyo Min.

455
00:29:32.489 --> 00:29:35.530
He was supposed to graduate with Sang Goo.

456
00:29:36.229 --> 00:29:39.630
Unfortunately, he will never graduate.

457
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:44.340
I couldn't tell the kids,

458
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:47.769
so I told them he went to Seoul for treatment.

459
00:29:47.939 --> 00:29:49.810
I didn't want them to get shocked.

460
00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:50.979
However,

461
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.150
I didn't know they would wait so long for him.

462
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.749
That's why Sang Goo won't graduate...

463
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.290
until his friend returns.

464
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.060
He's being difficult.

465
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.400
Director,

466
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.800
did you get Ms. Nam's call?

467
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.070
What is this?

468
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.269
What's going on?

469
00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:20.040
What do you think?

470
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:21.880
Move.

471
00:30:21.939 --> 00:30:24.040
Da Seul, I'm sorry.

472
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.009
JH Entertainment...

473
00:30:26.009 --> 00:30:28.380
asked for some changes.

474
00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.749
Are you kidding me?

475
00:30:30.249 --> 00:30:32.290
That's ridiculous. We're on different levels.

476
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.429
Do you want to die?

477
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.530
Hey!

478
00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:43.600
Why are you always up on my case?

479
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.800
What do you have against me?

480
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.100
Yes, I hate you.

481
00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:49.040
You're not that pretty,

482
00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.900
nor is your acting good.

483
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.540
I'm mad that you're doing so well.

484
00:30:54.709 --> 00:30:56.009
So?

485
00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.610
There must be a reason why you're doing poorly.

486
00:31:02.249 --> 00:31:03.519
Listen.

487
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.919
I've had it up to here with my patience.

488
00:31:07.249 --> 00:31:09.120
That means, keep that mouth shut.

489
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.459
You little...

490
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.030
- Let go! Hey! - No!

491
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.640
You little...

492
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.610
No, it's not looking good.

493
00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:27.610
Why do you keep doing things your way?

494
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.709
That's what you're doing.

495
00:31:29.979 --> 00:31:31.310
You agreed on the radio,

496
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.280
then made mistakes on air.

497
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.780
That's why I had no other choice.

498
00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:40.189
I'm busy right now.

499
00:31:40.749 --> 00:31:41.790
I'm hanging up.

500
00:31:47.729 --> 00:31:49.030
Will it be all right?

501
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.630
Have you already talked to Ji Soo Ho?

502
00:31:52.999 --> 00:31:55.269
He has a daily radio show...

503
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:56.669
It's okay.

504
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.870
He'll make it work...

505
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.070
according to the schedule.

511
00:32:14.249 --> 00:32:17.189
That's sexy. Yes.

512
00:32:17.189 --> 00:32:19.689
Soo Ho, look more sexy.

513
00:32:19.689 --> 00:32:22.030
Yes, that's perfect.

514
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.300
One more time while looking at the camera.

515
00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:31.269
Okay. Good work.

516
00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:34.709
Soo Ho.

517
00:32:38.179 --> 00:32:39.550
Why do you keep ignoring me?

518
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.380
There must be a reason why, right?

519
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.979
Can you ignore me too?

520
00:32:42.979 --> 00:32:46.019
You're finally talking to me.

521
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.419
My appearance must have been shocking.

522
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.989
What is your plan?

523
00:32:51.989 --> 00:32:53.189
Why are you doing this?

524
00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:56.959
Soo Ho, we have to get along.

525
00:32:56.999 --> 00:32:58.130
Don't be like that to me.

526
00:32:58.499 --> 00:33:00.330
It's easy for me to act like we get along.

527
00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.340
Right.

528
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.999
You're a good actor.

529
00:33:03.999 --> 00:33:05.340
Is that all you need?

530
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.909
What? That's what Ms. Nam would say.

531
00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:10.040
"Is that all you need?"

532
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.550
You sound like a real family.

533
00:33:15.749 --> 00:33:17.280
Don't they?

534
00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.330
Yes, of course.

535
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:33.900
I'm at his shoot,

536
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.100
so don't worry.

537
00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:38.009
Gosh. You're sure talking big.

538
00:33:38.409 --> 00:33:41.340
You better stick to him like glue...

539
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.380
and bring him back on time.

540
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.880
We'll come back to Seoul right away.

541
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.780
Don't worry.

542
00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.650
Hey, what about Crazy Gang?

543
00:33:52.419 --> 00:33:55.719
Is this what you're giving out today?

544
00:33:55.719 --> 00:33:56.719
Yes.

545
00:33:58.689 --> 00:34:00.189
No guests again?

546
00:34:00.189 --> 00:34:02.429
Just Soo Ho for two hours?

547
00:34:03.159 --> 00:34:06.600
You should try not to rely on idols and gifts.

548
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.969
How about focusing on the true value of radio?

549
00:34:09.539 --> 00:34:11.510
Do you think you're the only one...

550
00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:12.970
who knows the true value?

551
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.309
Are you saying everything else...

552
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.010
is wrong?

553
00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:18.749
Why do we use idols?

554
00:34:18.749 --> 00:34:20.849
Why do we spend money on the gifts?

555
00:34:20.849 --> 00:34:22.220
Yes, why do you?

556
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.490
It's such a cheap trick.

557
00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:28.590
That's how you ruin radio.

558
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.619
Ruin radio?

559
00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:33.289
We have to attract the younger generation.

560
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:35.300
The world has changed.

561
00:34:35.559 --> 00:34:38.200
You can't target the preexisting group.

562
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.169
What about in the future?

563
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.539
I'll say what you say to remind you.

564
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.639
If we want radio to live on...

565
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.280
while this earth is alive and breathing,

566
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.410
then we must attract the younger generation.

567
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:52.780
We have to show them...

568
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:55.019
that we have contents that they like,

569
00:34:55.019 --> 00:34:56.320
and that radio is great!

570
00:34:57.419 --> 00:34:58.490
You're right.

571
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.950
What?

572
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.389
What you said is right.

573
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.090
I'll consider it.

574
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.289
Thank you, my friend.

575
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.229
Also, don't touch my table, jerk.

576
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.530
We have to go back to Seoul now.

577
00:35:14.369 --> 00:35:16.999
You go ahead. I'll go with Ms. Song.

578
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.139
Tae Ri, you can go ahead.

579
00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:21.709
Just ignore me instead.

580
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.119
Ji Soo Ho, get on.

582
00:35:49.169 --> 00:35:50.740
Heavy snowfall warning...

583
00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.669
has been issued for Gangwon Province.

584
00:35:52.669 --> 00:35:54.070
Many accidents...

585
00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.309
- have roads congested. - This is no good.

586
00:35:56.709 --> 00:35:58.410
According to the meteorologist,

587
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.479
the snow clouds from Seoul...

588
00:36:00.479 --> 00:36:02.119
is heading to Gangwon Province.

589
00:36:02.249 --> 00:36:05.090
Snow will get heavier after 3pm.

590
00:36:05.749 --> 00:36:08.860
The snow is expected to continue tonight.

591
00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.820
Next on the news.

592

594
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.169
Darn it.

595
00:36:56.669 --> 00:36:58.340
Mr. Lee. What should we do?

596
00:36:58.669 --> 00:37:00.610
There must have been an accident.

597
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:01.840
The bridge is blocked,

598
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.639
and we're trapped.

599
00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:05.180
So you can't come?

600
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.720
Tell me. Yes or no?

601
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.550
I can't be certain, but probably not.

602
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.919
Hey. You have a recording, right?

603
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.619
You must have at least one back-up, right?

604
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.999
Hey, Geu Rim.

605
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.570
You told me not to worry and that...

606
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.869
- you'd bring him! - Hi.

607
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.269
Can you send a broadcast van from Chuncheon?

608
00:37:32.439 --> 00:37:33.570
Hey, Geu Rim.

609
00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:36.680
Do you really want to get fired?

610
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.590
Where are you?

611
00:37:45.419 --> 00:37:47.220
We will go on air today, no matter what.

612
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.459
Get yourself to a nearby station somehow.

613
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.689
We did plenty of mobile broadcasts, right?

614
00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.400
Get your act together.

615
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.930
You'll work out of a broadcast van.

616
00:37:58.599 --> 00:38:01.200
- What about you? - I'll be in Seoul.

617
00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:04.070
You'll need to rewrite the script.

618
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.309
You can do it, right?

619
00:38:06.369 --> 00:38:08.240
This is the opening and what I wrote about...

620
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.380
the Dongil Elementary graduation.

621
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.550
Mr. Lee. I have a good idea.

622
00:38:37.169 --> 00:38:38.510
Yes, Mr. Lee.

623
00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:40.439
Okay, Newbie.

624
00:38:40.709 --> 00:38:42.939
We'll broadcast in parts as you said,

625
00:38:43.039 --> 00:38:45.510
but you're in charge there, okay?

626
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.349
Yes, sir.

627
00:38:49.749 --> 00:38:50.919
Set it up in an hour.

628
00:38:50.919 --> 00:38:53.090
The story is good today, so trust yourself.

629
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.959
Let me talk to Soo Ho.

630
00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.459
Soo Ho...

631
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.400
Soo Ho.

632
00:39:03.999 --> 00:39:06.430
You told me not to call Geu Rim "Newbie," right?

633
00:39:08.499 --> 00:39:10.139
You said you were a pro, right?

634
00:39:10.939 --> 00:39:13.910
So? What are you getting at?

635
00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:16.840
Please treat Geu Rim like a main writer today.

636
00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:27.220
We have to broadcast from there today.

637
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.459
I won't condone any mistakes.

638
00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:33.860
I won't make any mistakes. Don't you make any either.

639
00:39:44.439 --> 00:39:45.510
It'll work out.

640
00:39:56.849 --> 00:39:57.919
Here.

641
00:40:32.249 --> 00:40:33.389
You're shaking.

642
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.559
I'm not shaking from the cold.

643
00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:37.660
Exactly.

644
00:40:38.059 --> 00:40:41.059
Tell me what I can do right now. I'll do it.

645
00:40:44.769 --> 00:40:47.430
We need to broadcast live from here, right?

646
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:49.999
Yes.

647
00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:52.209
And you and I must do it somehow.

648
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.639
Yes.

649
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.680
So let's get our acts together, not shake,

650
00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:01.249
and do what we must.

651
00:41:01.979 --> 00:41:04.220
Okay. What should I do first?

652
00:41:05.289 --> 00:41:06.419
Then...

653
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.459
Well...

654
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.430
I... I need your help.

655
00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.470
(Dongil Elementary School Graduation)

656
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.479
I need to write the script within an hour.

657
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.880
It'll be about this school's graduation.

658
00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:35.650
Please interview Sang Goo, the last graduate.

659
00:41:36.419 --> 00:41:39.249
He's similar to you, so you'll probably get along.

660
00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.180
Aren't you going to stop me?

661
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:10.380
- Will that stop you? - No.

662
00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:11.720
Then do it.

663
00:42:48.389 --> 00:42:49.559
What's your deal?

664
00:42:49.619 --> 00:42:52.729
Why do you keep following me around?

665
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.300
You're with that poodle hair woman, right?

666
00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.930
You really are similar to someone.

667
00:43:00.229 --> 00:43:02.369
What? Get lost!

668
00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:06.070
Did you say stuff like that to your friend too?

669
00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.369
What?

670
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:10.139
Did you wish he wouldn't go,

671
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.550
so you pushed him away,

672
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.410
telling him to leave?

673
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:27.530
Go!

674
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:32.030
Just go to Seoul by yourself!

675
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.869
Go!

676
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:43.809
How did you know?

677
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:46.610
I know.

678
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.849
But...

679
00:43:50.119 --> 00:43:51.320
he won't come back.

680
00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:57.459
People who won't come back will never return.

(Dongil Elementary School Graduation)

684
00:45:06.889 --> 00:45:07.959
Hi.

685
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.099
- Where's Sang Goo? - He said he'd come first.

686
00:45:11.669 --> 00:45:13.130
He must've gone to his teacher.

687
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:16.070
I couldn't do this.

688
00:45:16.669 --> 00:45:17.769
That's fine.

689
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.740
The script...

690
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.340
May I look at it with you?

691
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:44.630
Get the song list exactly right.

692
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:45.869
Yes, sir. I did.

693
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.840
Support us. Thanks.

694
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.740
The equipment is okay, right?

695
00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:58.079
Sang Goo is missing.

696
00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:02.079
He suddenly came and asked for Gyo Min's address.

697
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:04.919
He asked where in Seoul he moved to.

698
00:46:05.389 --> 00:46:07.220
He just left.

699
00:46:07.889 --> 00:46:09.459
I thought he'd be back soon.

700
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:45.760
What do we do?

701
00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:47.590
I based the script on him.

702
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.829
I don't think we can do the show today.

703
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:51.570
- I'll call Mr. Lee... - Wait.

704
00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.530
Let me look for him a little more.

705
00:46:56.669 --> 00:46:57.669
Did you...

706
00:46:57.939 --> 00:47:00.010
tell Sang Goo about Gyo Min?

707
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.579
He went to Seoul to get treatment,

708
00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:07.050
but he never came back.

709
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.880
I'm sorry.

710
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.479
I shouldn't have said what I said.

711
00:48:18.619 --> 00:48:20.050
However, it's the truth.

712
00:48:21.019 --> 00:48:22.289
Don't wait for someone who won't come back.

713
00:48:24.289 --> 00:48:25.289
However,

714
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.360
there are people who want to return,

715
00:48:28.229 --> 00:48:29.630
but are unable to.

716
00:48:32.869 --> 00:48:36.499
Someone said this to me long time ago.

717
00:48:37.669 --> 00:48:39.070
"Just because you're not crying..."

718
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:41.070
"doesn't mean you're not sad."

719
00:48:42.139 --> 00:48:43.240
"Just because you're smiling..."

720
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:46.280
"doesn't mean you're happy."

721
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.880
You're still...

722
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.320
small, weak, and young.

723
00:48:53.619 --> 00:48:55.619
If you keep holding in your tears,

724
00:48:57.289 --> 00:48:58.430
you'll end up like me.

725
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.139
He said he'd be back after his trip to Seoul.

726
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.680
He promised to return...

727
00:49:16.709 --> 00:49:17.950
before the graduation.

728
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:20.979
He told me to wait.

729
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:23.119
He promised.

730
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:25.019
But I told him to go.

731
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.090
I told him I wouldn't wait.

732
00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.959
That's what I said.

733
00:49:32.189 --> 00:49:34.030
I feel like he's not returning...

734
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.760
because I told him to leave.

735
00:49:38.499 --> 00:49:39.599
That...

736
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.970
That really...

737
00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.470
aches my heart.

738
00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.769
Should I wait for him...

739
00:49:47.769 --> 00:49:49.380
instead of graduating?

740
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:51.410
Or...

741
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.749
can I graduate?

742
00:49:54.619 --> 00:49:56.479
I'm waiting for him to tell me.

743
00:50:00.289 --> 00:50:02.419
Do you want me to help you ask him?

744
00:50:05.189 --> 00:50:07.789
You can ask him yourself.

745
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.530
How?

746
00:50:11.729 --> 00:50:12.800
Through the radio.

747
00:50:14.229 --> 00:50:16.070
He'll be listening to you.

748
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:31.519
How many minutes do we have left?

749
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:33.419
10 minutes.

750
00:50:38.289 --> 00:50:39.289
Mr. Lee.

751
00:50:40.229 --> 00:50:41.700
Hun Jung, get ready to go on air.

752
00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.700
Pardon?

753
00:50:44.059 --> 00:50:45.070
Okay.

754
00:50:48.869 --> 00:50:51.139
Microphone test. 1, 2, 3.

755

This is Ji Soo Ho's Radio Romance.

1, 2, 3. 2, 2, 3.

757
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.990
Cue.

758
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.630
I was sending...

759
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:23.669
a signal with my flashlight.

760
00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:27.910
How long were you doing that for?

761
00:51:29.579 --> 00:51:30.809
Up until now,

762
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.479
maybe about 10,000 times?

763
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.050
I told him to come back soon.

764
00:51:38.919 --> 00:51:42.289
We should hold hands and do it together.

765
00:51:43.289 --> 00:51:45.389
Just like how we planted the plants together...

766
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.660
and how we played soccer together.

767
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.570
We should graduate together too.

768
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.800
I wanted to apologize...

769
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.970
for telling him to leave.

770
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.539
I actually wanted to ask him not to go.

771

Yes.

(Do you have any last comments?)

781
00:52:34.269 --> 00:52:37.410
Do you have anything else you want to say?

782
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.619
Please help our school...

783
00:52:43.019 --> 00:52:44.749
to keep running.

784
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:48.760
I won't graduate.

785
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:51.229
If I'm not here...

786
00:52:51.689 --> 00:52:53.030
and if the school is gone,

787
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:56.559
my friend has nowhere to come back to.

788
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.070
We promised to graduate together.

789
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.869
If I graduate alone,

790
00:53:04.709 --> 00:53:06.010
I would be breaking our promise.

791
00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:16.849

We have a special song for our ending.

794
00:53:23.959 --> 00:53:25.990
The children of Dongil Elementary School...

795
00:53:26.189 --> 00:53:28.229
will sing Sanulrim's "Goodbye".

796
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:36.200
- Goodbye, my friend - Goodbye, my friend

797
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:43.539
- When the foghorn sounds - When the foghorn sounds

798
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:49.349
- Will you cry for me - Will you cry for me

799
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.289
- Without anyone knowing - Without anyone knowing

800
00:53:53.289 --> 00:53:59.030
- When everyone is asleep? - When everyone is asleep?

801
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.229
- Goodbye - No!

802
00:54:04.229 --> 00:54:06.970
- My love - My love

803
00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.400
This is so sad.

804
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.579
- When the stars twinkle - When the stars twinkle

805
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.809
- Will you say it for me - Will you say it for me

806
00:54:19.809 --> 00:54:23.780
- Without anyone knowing - Without anyone knowing

807
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.650
- That I went far away - That I went far away

808
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:30.090
- While crying? - While crying?

809
00:54:50.639 --> 00:54:51.709
Soo Ho.

810
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.720
You don't have to follow the script for the ending.

811
00:54:54.979 --> 00:54:57.380
Say what you want for the closing.

812
00:54:57.519 --> 00:54:58.519
What?

813
00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:01.519
I didn't write this by myself today.

814
00:55:01.519 --> 00:55:04.059
We made today's show together.

815
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:07.490
It would be great if you said what you wanted.

816
00:55:19.439 --> 00:55:21.939
I heard this on the radio once.

817
00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:25.979
"Just because you're not crying..."

818
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.320
"doesn't mean you're not sad."

819
00:55:30.019 --> 00:55:31.389
"Just like how smiling..."

820
00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:34.619
"doesn't mean you're happy."

821
00:55:47.599 --> 00:55:49.070
"Just because you're not crying..."

822
00:55:50.169 --> 00:55:51.740
"doesn't mean you're not sad."

823
00:55:52.639 --> 00:55:53.709
"Just like how smiling..."

824
00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:57.240
"doesn't mean you're happy."

825
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.079
A friend of mine said this to me...

826
00:56:02.479 --> 00:56:03.950
one day.

827
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.229
Ji Soo Ho's Radio Romance.

828
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:14.860
We'll end today on that note.

829
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.389
Hey, Mr. Lee.

830
00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.389
Yes?

831
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:47.999
The bulletin board...

832
00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.300
(Ji Soo Ho is a murderer!)

833
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:06.780
We got this a few days ago too.

834
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.749
(Ji Soo Ho is a murderer.)

835
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.660
(Ji Soo Ho is a murderer.)

836
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.860
Yes, so...

837
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.959
The guest I'm in charge of...

838
00:57:23.999 --> 00:57:25.900
will get into a relationship...

839
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.599
he never experienced before.

840
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.840
I have no idea how he'll react.

841
00:57:37.439 --> 00:57:39.450
I'm so curious.

842
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:41.749
Aren't you?

843
00:57:55.999 --> 00:57:58.570
Where did Soo Ho go?

844
00:58:00.329 --> 00:58:02.340
I'm not sure. Maybe to the men's room?

845
00:58:03.639 --> 00:58:06.510
Hey, when did you two get so close?

846
00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.840
What's the secret?

847
00:58:08.439 --> 00:58:09.809
He said he's the same as me.

848
00:58:10.139 --> 00:58:12.950
He doesn't want someone to leave.

849
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.280
He also told someone to leave.

850
00:58:17.419 --> 00:58:18.720
Do you know who that is?

851
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:24.959
Those who won't come back won't ever come back.

852
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:26.789
That's what he said.

853
00:58:27.229 --> 00:58:30.229
He must be waiting for someone too.

854
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.369
Also...

855
00:58:37.439 --> 00:58:38.669
You should go home.

856
00:58:48.249 --> 00:58:50.479
I gave you my number, right?

857
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.950
Call me if you come to Seoul.

858
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:57.220
Let's go. You should go too.

859
00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.530
Are you telling me to go or not?

860
00:58:59.789 --> 00:59:01.559
I mean it this time.

861
00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.459
Congratulations on your graduation.

862
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:08.470
Right.

863
00:59:09.369 --> 00:59:11.510
Where should I hang this?

864
00:59:11.639 --> 00:59:14.139
Where did you hang your diploma?

865
00:59:15.079 --> 00:59:17.950
I don't have one.

866
00:59:30.189 --> 00:59:33.430
(Woo Ji Woo)

867
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:45.439
(Woo Ji Woo)

868
00:59:47.979 --> 00:59:54.410
(Graduation Certificate, Name: Ji Soo Ho)

869
01:00:15.139 --> 01:00:16.599
I'm so happy.

870
01:00:21.439 --> 01:00:24.749
I had a dream making these baby steps.

871
01:00:26.979 --> 01:00:29.519
You read my manuscript today.

872
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.490
I took my first step in my dream.

873
01:00:33.189 --> 01:00:36.789
My first stamp on radio listeners.

874
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.200
Soo Ho, thank you so much.

875
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:49.639
I'm curious about something.

876
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.139
- What is it? - It's about your closing.

877
01:00:54.579 --> 01:00:55.979
"Just because you're not crying..."

878
01:00:55.979 --> 01:00:57.539
"doesn't mean you're not sad."

879
01:00:59.079 --> 01:01:00.150
"Just like how smiling..."

880
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.619
"doesn't mean you're happy."

881
01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.789
It's my favorite line.

882
01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.590
Where did you hear it from?

883
01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:17.760
When I look at things like this,

884
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.169
I think we have a little in common. Right?

885
01:02:10.749 --> 01:02:12.419
When I was really young,

886
01:02:13.289 --> 01:02:16.059
I suffered a fever for three days.

887
01:02:18.889 --> 01:02:20.130
However,

888
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:23.300
neither of my parents knew.

889
01:02:29.369 --> 01:02:30.570
Isn't it funny?

890
01:02:34.139 --> 01:02:35.740
Not at all.

891
01:02:37.809 --> 01:02:39.579
Why are you laughing when it's not funny?

892
01:02:49.289 --> 01:02:51.260
Whenever I'm sick,

893
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.099
my mom taps on my back like this.

894
01:02:55.999 --> 01:02:57.459
It makes my heart melt.

895
01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.970
I don't feel sick anymore when she does this.

896
01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.740
I heard this on the radio once.

897
01:03:05.139 --> 01:03:07.010
"Just because you're not crying..."

898
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:10.340
"doesn't mean you're not sad."

899
01:03:13.579 --> 01:03:15.079
"Just like how smiling..."

900
01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:18.289
"doesn't mean you're happy."

901
01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:34.639
Song Geu Rim.

902
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:38.169
Don't you...

903
01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:43.410
remember me?
